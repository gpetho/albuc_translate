The author of this book says: When I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is a part of medical science in its entirety, and have reached the utmost clarity and explanation in it, I saw fit to complete it for you with this chapter, which is a part of the practical work.
Because practical work is completely lacking in our country and in our time, so much so that its knowledge is almost extinct and its influence has ceased. And only a few outlines remain of it in the books of the ancients, which have been copied by hands and affected by error and confusion, until its meanings have become obscure and its benefit has been lost.
Therefore, I saw fit to revive it and to compose this chapter on it in a way that is explanatory, clear, and concise, and to include pictures of cauterizing irons and other surgical instruments, since this increases clarity and is very necessary.
The reason why there is no skilled craftsman in our time is that the craft of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must beforehand practice in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen. Until he understands the functions, forms, temperaments, connections, and separations of the organs, and knows the bones, nerves, muscles, their number, and their origins and the pulsating and non-pulsating vessels, and the places of their origins.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the craft of surgery, and we have mentioned a part of this in the introduction to this book.
For he who is not knowledgeable in the anatomy we have mentioned will inevitably make mistakes that kill people, as I have often witnessed among those who have imagined themselves learned in this science and claimed it without knowledge or experience.
And that is because I saw an ignorant physician who incised a swine erysipelas in a woman's neck, and severed some of the neck's arteries, so the woman bled until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who proceeded to remove a stone from a man who had been stabbed in the bladder; the stone was large, so he acted rashly and extracted it with a piece of the bladder's substance. So the man died after about three days, and I had been called to remove it; and from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I had estimated that.
And I saw another physician who earned his living practicing medicine among some of the procurers of our city.
Then a black boy who had a fracture in his leg near the heel, along with a wound, came to him.  In his ignorance, the physician quickly bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and splints very tightly, and left no room for the wound to breathe.
Then he indulged his desires, and left him for days, ordering him not to untie the bandage until his leg and foot swelled and he was near death.
Then I was called to him, and I quickly untied the bandage; so he found relief and was freed from his pains, except that the corruption had become firmly established in the limb, and I could not prevent it.
Then the corruption continued to spread in the limb until he died.
And I saw another physician cauterize a cancerous tumor, which ulcerated after days until his patient's affliction became great.  That is because if a cancer is purely of a black humor, then it should not be touched with an iron instrument at all.
Except it be in a limb that can be entirely excised.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual operations are divided into two parts: an operation accompanied by safety, and an operation accompanied by harm in most cases.
And I have warned in every place where it occurs in this book about the operation which involves risk and fear, therefore you should avoid and reject it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to criticize and attack, therefore take precautions and circumspection for yourselves, and gentleness and deliberation for your patients.
And use the best method leading to safety and a favorable outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to cure.
And protect yourselves from that which you fear might cast suspicion on your religion and your worldly affairs, for this is more lasting for your reputation and higher for your standing in this world and the next.
For Galen said in some of his precepts, "Do not treat a bad disease, lest you become a bad physician.
This chapter is divided into three sections.
The first section.
On cauterization with fire and with strong medicine, arranged from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments and cautery irons, and everything needed for the work by hand.
And the second section.
On incision, perforation, bloodletting, cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and the like, all arranged systematically with illustrations of the instruments.
And the third section.
On setting, traction, and the treatment of dislocations and the like, arranged systematically from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments.
The first section.
On cauterization.
And before we describe its use, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
And I say that the discussion of the benefits and harms of cauterization is lengthy and a precise science and a hidden secret, and a number of wise men have spoken about it.
And they differed in it, and I have shortened from their speech a little for fear of lengthening.
And I say that cauterization generally benefits every bad temperament that is with a substance and without a substance, except for two temperaments, which are the hot temperament without a substance and the dry temperament without a substance.
As for the dry temperament with a substance, they differed concerning it. Some of them said that cauterization is beneficial in it, and others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable in a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible to be cured of a hot dry disease with a hot dry medicine. And he who says the opposite said that cauterization with fire may benefit from a hot dry disease that occurs in the bodies of people. Because when you add the body of man and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you hit the body of man with cold.
And I say with his saying, because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that one should not imagine that matter except one who has trained and practiced in the chapter of cauterization a thorough practice. And he stood upon the difference of the temperaments of people and the state of diseases in themselves, and their causes, and their symptoms, and the length of their time.
But as for the other temperaments, there is no fear for you from them, especially the cold and moist diseases, for all the physicians have agreed upon them and have not differed in the benefit of cauterization in them.
And know, O my sons, that of the secret of treatment, cauterization with fire and its advantage over cauterization with burning medicine, is because fire is a simple element, its action does not exceed the member which is cauterized, nor does it harm another member connected to it except a little harm.
And cauterization with burning medicine, its effect may exceed to what is beyond of the members, and perhaps it causes in the member a disease difficult to treat, and perhaps it kills, and fire, for its nobility and the excellence of its substance, does not do that except if one exaggerates.
And that has become clear to us by experience, through long service and care in the craft and standing upon the realities of the matter.
For this reason I have dispensed with lengthy discussion, and were it not that it is not befitting to this book of mine, I would have presented to you concerning fire a hidden secret and its manner of action in bodies and its expulsion of diseases with philosophical, demonstrative discourse too subtle for your understanding.
And know, O my sons, that they have differed concerning the time which is suitable for cauterization, and they have made the best time the time of spring.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at every time, because the harm occurring from the time is consumed in the benefit which is brought about by cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for strong, necessary, urgent pains which do not tolerate delay, because of what is feared from them that it will be followed by a calamity which is greater than the slight harm entering from the time.
And let it not occur to you, O my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization which cures a certain disease will never return, and they make it a blame.
And the matter is not as they suppose, because cauterization is only in the position of medicine which changes the temperament and dries the humors which are the cause of the occurrence of pains.
Except that cauterization is preferred to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.
And it is possible that the disease may return at some time, according to the temperament of the patient, the power of his disease, and its strength, and what is prepared in his body of the gathering of impurities in it, and his neglect of himself in acquiring them from foods and similar causes.
Except that the disease in which cauterization is used is a mild disease and in a member with few impurities and humors. Like cauterizing a tooth for pain and the like, for it is possible that that pain may not return, and that is in the least.
And as for the common people's saying also that cauterization is the last of medicine, it is a correct saying, not to what they go to, for they believe that no treatment is beneficial with medicine or without it after the occurrence of cauterization, and the matter is otherwise.
And the meaning of cauterization being the last of medicine is only that when we use types of treatment in a disease and those medicines do not work, then we use cauterization as the last thing, and it works; from here it came to be that cauterization is the last of medicine. Not in the sense to which the common people and many ignorant physicians went.
The ancients mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said that because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence, and they said that the place of cauterization does not suppurate; and that is not absolutely the case.
Because I have tried it and found that it only does that in some bodies and not others, and cauterization with it is better and superior to iron, as they said, except that if you heat the cautery iron in the fire of gold, you will not know when it is heated to the degree you want because of the redness of the gold.
And because it quickly becomes cold, and if you increase its heat in the fire, it melts and is wasted; therefore, the craftsman is troubled by that.  Therefore, cauterization with iron is quicker and closer to the truth for us to work with, God willing.
And I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections that I have organized from head to foot, so that it may be easy for the student what he wants from it, God willing.
Chapter One.
Cauterization of the head, one cauterization.
This cauterization benefits from the excess of moisture and coldness in the brain, which are the cause of headaches and frequent colds from the head to the region of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and throat pain. And in short, for every illness that results from cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of this cauterization is that you first order the patient to vomit using a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and habit.
Then you order him to shave his head with a razor, then you seat him before you cross-legged, placing his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes; where your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery iron, which is of this form.
Expose the bone the size of a toothpick head or the size of a carob seed; then lift your hand, or else, if it has cooled, replace your hand with the same instrument or another. Until you see the amount of bone I mentioned to you. Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a cotton swab in it, place it on the area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton swab soaked in butter to it and leave it there until the eschar from the cautery separates. Then treat it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals, God willing.
And they have said that the longer a wound remains open, the more pus it discharges, and this is better and more beneficial.
Some have mentioned cauterizing the skin to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the thickness of the bone is burned, then removing what was burned from the bone, and then treating it.
And others said that it is necessary to exaggerate the cauterization so that it strongly affects the bone, until it falls from the bone like a small carat or disc.  They claimed that this vents the vapors of the head from that area and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals.  I do not see these two types of cauterization at all except in some people and by way of risk.  In my opinion, leaving it is better and safer, for the head weakens whenever its natural connection is separated, as we have witnessed in other members.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it.  Act accordingly and you will be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
On cauterizing the head also.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head and it persists in the patient, and he has used purgatives, clysters, snuffs, ointments, and dressings, especially if he has been cauterized with the single cauterization that we described and none of that has benefited him, then look. If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, cauterize him again a little above the previous cauterization. Then cauterize each temple of his head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone that we described is revealed. And cauterize him at the back of his head in the place known as the hatchet, and lighten your hand in this and do not uncover the bone, for the patient will feel a severe pain from it, unlike the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head, and I will mention this cauterization in its place.
And the cautery with which the temples and the back of the head are cauterized should be gentler than the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized, and this is its image.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing non-chronic hemicrania.
If pain occurs in a fissure of the head with headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then let the patient vomit with purgative medicines for the head, and use all the treatment which I mentioned in the divisions of diseases; and if that does not work, then cauterization is done in two ways. Either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine or with iron.
As for cauterization with a burning medicine, take a single clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends on both sides, then incise the place of pain in the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a space under the skin that will accommodate the clove.
Then insert it under the skin until it disappears, then bind it tightly with bandages, and leave it for fifteen hours, then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then dress it.
Apply a cotton swab soaked in butter until the area suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.  If you wish, do this with some of the burning medicines which I gave in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
As for cauterization with iron, it is in this manner: heat the cautery, the image of which is this:
And it is called the nail cautery because its head is like the head of a nail, with some perforation and a small projection in its middle.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you rotate the iron little by little, and the amount you burn should be about half the thickness of the skin. Then lift your hand so as not to burn the artery beneath and cause bleeding. Then soak cotton in salt water and apply it to the area and leave it for three days. Then dress the cotton with butter, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this headache with the knife-like end of the cautery, and be careful not to cut the artery in this chronic headache, especially.
Chapter Four.
Cauterization of the chronic headache.
If you treat the headache with what we have mentioned of the preceding treatment and what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not work, and you see from the ailment something that what we mentioned of the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire cannot overcome. Then you should heat the knife-like cautery until it turns white, after you have drawn a line on the painful area, its length half a finger or so, and you should withdraw your hand once, while you are pulling it, until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Except that you should be careful about the contact of the jaw which moves during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or its motor nerve, and spasms result.
And be cautious and watchful of the bleeding from the artery which you have cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially for one who is ignorant of what he does and has not been a practiced expert; and leaving the work is preferable.
And the treatment of bleeding occurring from an artery will be mentioned in its place in the book, God willing; if you see a condition for which this cauterization is not sufficient.
And you saw the patient's body able to withstand cauterization in the middle of the head as we described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cauterization that we mentioned in the chapter on the incision of the artery with the double-bladed cautery, for it is a better and more effective cauterization than this.
Chapter Five.
In cauterizing the pains of the ears.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and it is treated with laxatives and all the treatment that we mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery which is called the point, whose image is this.
Then, after heating it, apply it with a point around the entire ear, as it goes around, or around both if the pain is in both. And keep the cautery a little away from the root of the ear after marking the place with ink, and the cautery should be about ten points in each ear or thereabouts, then treat the places until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Six.
On cauterizing the paralysis.
The paralysis treated by cautery is that type which arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classification of diseases.
And avoid cauterizing the type which arises from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you have treated this type of paralysis with ointments, snuffs, and gargles and your treatment has been ineffective, then the patient should be cauterized with three cauterizations. One at the root of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
And make your cauterization on the opposite side from the diseased side, because the relaxation occurs on the side which appears healthy.
And the image of the cauterization is that you cauterize with a cauterization opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple, and its length should be the length of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin.  This is the image of the cautery; it is a type of scalpel, the image of which has preceded, but it is a little gentler, as you see. The knife should be somewhat thicker than usual. Then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
Cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
If the apoplexy becomes chronic and you treat it with what we have mentioned, and your treatment is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize him in four places. One cauterization on each temple, one in the middle of the head as previously mentioned, and one at the back of the head as previously described.
The application of the cautery is as previously described.  It may also be cauterized at the mouth of the stomach, which is more effective, then treat as previously described.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for forgetfulness.
If it is due to phlegm, the patient should first be given strong purgatives and brain-cleansing pills.
Then his whole head should be shaved and a mustard plaster, as described in the chapter on plasters, should be applied to the back of his head repeatedly; for this is a kind of cauterization.
Do this in the exact order I have described there. If he is cured by this, well and good; otherwise, cauterize him three times at the back of his head, the cauterizations being arranged from the top of the head to the nape of the neck.
Make the space between each cauterization the width of a finger. Then treat the cauterization as described above. If you wish to increase [the number of cauterizations] and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle again.
If you wish to increase [the number of cauterizations], cauterize the temples, then treat it until it heals.  The cautery should be olive-shaped, as described above.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterizing paralysis and general body relaxation.
It is necessary that you first cleanse the head with purgatives and as we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head, then cauterize: one cauterization in the middle of the head, one on each temple, and one on the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck. If, in a case of general body relaxation, you need more than that, and the patient can tolerate it, and the disease is strong and persistent, then cauterize with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of his back. And reach with the cautery until you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand, then treat him as previously mentioned until he is healed, God willing.  The cautery should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterizing epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm is cauterized.  It is necessary to first cleanse his brain with strong purgatives and with all the other treatments that we mentioned in the classification, if the patient is an adult and able to tolerate taking medicine.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then use gargles and mouthwashes that cleanse the brain many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then shave his head, then cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head as previously described, and another cautery at the back of the head. And on each temple one cautery. If the patient is strong and able to tolerate it, cauterize him with the cauteries mentioned for the patient with paralysis and body relaxation, on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery be olive-shaped as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauteries we mentioned for the patient with paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined to black bile and the patient's body is moist, purge him with that which cleanses his brain, as was mentioned previously in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of linen like a circle, then place it in the middle of his head, with the patient sitting cross-legged holding it from every side, then take one pound of old sheep fat.
Then heat it over the fire to a moderate heat, as much as the finger can withstand when inserted into it, then pour it into the middle of his head in the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this for the patient once every week along with all other good treatment until he is cured, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small punctures without holding your hand to the cautery, but rather let it be a fumigation, for this type of cautery moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply to it cotton soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing the watery discharge in the eye.
If the watery discharge in the eye becomes apparent to you with the signs which I mentioned in the classification, then act quickly, and purge the patient of whatever cleanses his head and protect him from all humors and sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize him in the middle of the head, then cauterize him twice on the temples if the onset of the watery discharge is in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin, and let the cauterizations be lengthwise across the temples, and guard against the bleeding of blood.
If you see something of it, cut it off immediately with any treatment possible, and we will discuss the wisdom in cauterizing and cutting the arteries and guarding against bleeding.
And it may be cauterized in the nape of the neck under the two bones with two extensive cauterizations.
Chapter Thirteen.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic weeping sores.
If the weeping sores of the eye are chronic and persistent, and are from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head, outside the head, and you are certain that it is from a cold, thick, phlegmatic excess, then cauterize it with the cautery that I described for the beginning of the descending water. A cauterization in the middle of the head and two cauterizations on the temples and two cauterizations in the nape of the neck under the two bones. And if you need more, then cauterize one cauterization on each side of the tail of the eye at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
Concerning the cauterization of the foul smell of the nose.
If you treat it with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment is not effective, then immediately purge the patient with colocynth for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle with the olive-shaped cautery iron. Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery iron, two cauterizations above the eyebrows slightly below the hair, and be careful of the artery, do not cut it. And this is the image of the nail-shaped cautery iron.
Chapter Fifteen.
Concerning the cauterization of the relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes from illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid with one cauterization using this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize above the eyebrows slightly, two cauterizations on each side, and keep a distance from the temples, and let the length of each cauterization be the length of the eyebrow.
And do not exaggerate with the cauterization, but only to the extent that one-third of the skin is burned, and the shape of the cautery iron is as follows.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its margins turn inward, so that the eye is pricked, then cauterization in it is of two types. Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a burning medicine. As for cauterization with fire, you order the patient beforehand to leave his eyelashes alone, if he is one who plucks them, until they grow long and become even.
If he pricks it while they are growing, then tie his eyes with a bandage lest they move until they grow. Then, when they have grown and become even, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark on the eyelid with ink a sign in the shape of an acacia leaf.
The beginning of the mark should be near the margins. Then, place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a lizard. Then, heat a cautery iron, its form is this.
Then cauterize according to the shape you marked, little by little, in many times, until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of the acacia leaf, is completely burned, especially its surface. A sign of the correctness of your work is that you see the eyelid has curled up and the hair has risen from the flesh of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days. Then apply cotton with butter to it until the scab is removed, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If some of the hair returns after a time and the eyelid relaxes,
repeat the cauterization in that place as you did before. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with a burning medicine, it is that you order the patient to leave the margins until they grow long and even.
Then make from paper the shape of an acacia leaf. Then take from the usual soap and from unslaked lime, of each one a drachm weight or so, and crush them together well. Do this quickly lest it dry. Then spread some of it on the paper which you made in the shape of an acacia leaf, and place it on one or both eyelids. Place cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on top of the medicine and hold it down slightly, while moving it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medicine, because he will feel a burning sensation like fire. As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. When the burning ceases, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And look: if you see the eyelid has risen as it rises when cauterized with fire or by cutting, then leave it. Otherwise, repeat the medicine on the place where the medicine did not take effect and did not turn black, until you complete your work and the eye is cauterized. Then place cotton with fat on it until the burning subsides.
Then treat it with palm-tree ointment or other until it heals.  It is necessary for you during the procedure to be extremely careful that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after some days, and something like a hair is suspected in the eye,
then repeat the medicine on that place of the eyelid which has relaxed, specifically as you did initially, then treat it until it heals. This is the image of the acacia leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, so your cauterization should be according to that. The correct method is not hidden from one who is experienced in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the fistula which appears in the canthus of the eye.
If you treat the fistula with what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
You should order the patient to place his head in your lap, and a servant should hold his head in front of you in such a way that it does not move or shake.
Then you place cotton soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a frog on his eyes, then you heat the cautery which is of this shape.
It should be hollow like the quill of an eagle's feather at one end, which is the cauterizing end; and if you wish, it can be perforated at the other end, and if you wish, it can be solid like an awl, although the hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then, squeeze the fistula if it is open and remove its contents and dry it; or if it is not open, open it and remove its pus. Then, place the cautery on it while it is very hot, holding it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And move your hand slightly away during cauterization, from the eye towards the nose, lest your hand should slip or the patient should move, and the cautery fall into the conjunctiva and damage it.  If you reach the bone with the first cauterization, well and good; otherwise, repeat the cauterization a second time if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton with butter and treat it with drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply a strong, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed, and treat it as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing a fistula, mentioned by some of the ancients:  You should approach the site of the fistula, incise it, and then place a thin cone in the incision itself; this is its image.
Pour into it the weight of a dirham of molten lead, and hold your hand on the cone firmly and steadily, and the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead flow into his eye. It is advisable to place on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or water.
For the lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it wonderfully. If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment we have mentioned, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to use nasal perforation and return the fistula to the nasal passage, as will be detailed in its appropriate place.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing a cleft lip.
A cleft often occurs in the lip, called a harelip, especially in the lips of children; it occurs frequently. If you treat this cleft with what we mentioned in the section and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-shaped cautery in this manner.
Its cavity should be as fine as a knife. Then apply it, hot and quickly, to the cleft itself until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft; then treat it with the cautery until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing fistulas occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling appears at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and a fistula results from the flow of pus, and you treat it but the treatment is not effective, then you should heat a cautery to the extent that it fits into the fistula.
Then insert it, hot, into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end. Do this once or twice, then treat it afterwards with what we have mentioned in the treatment until it heals, God willing.
If the discharge ceases and it heals, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to examine the area, and to remove the diseased bone, according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Concerning the cauterization of loose molars and gums.
If the gums are loose due to moisture and the molars are mobile, and you have treated them with medication without success, then place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery iron, whose image comes after this, after you have placed the tube on the tooth.
And insert the hot cautery iron quickly, and hold your hand for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then lift your hand, then return the cautery iron repeatedly as you wish, then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water.
And let him hold it for an hour and then spit it out; for the mobile tooth will become firm, and the loose gum will tighten, and the putrid moisture will dry.
Chapter twenty-one.
On cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is from cold, or if there are worms in it, and treatment with medication has not been effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fat, or cauterization with fire.
As for cauterization with fat, you take cow’s fat and boil it in an iron spoon or in a shell, then you take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, then dip it in the boiled fat and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the strength of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.  If you wish, you can dip wool or cotton in cold fat and place it on the aching tooth and place a heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, take a brass or iron tube, and let it be somewhat thick in its body, so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient’s mouth.  Then heat the cautery iron which is depicted and place it on the tooth itself and hold your hand until the cautery iron cools.  Do this repeatedly.
Then the pain will go away, either that same day or the next day. After this cauterization, it is advisable that the patient fill his mouth with good fat and hold it for an hour, then spit it out. This is the image of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, and as much as is possible. This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If fistulas are caused by phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to ripening with medication, and you desire rapid ripening, then heat a hollow cautery iron, which has this image, perforated at both ends.
So that smoke exits from the other end during cauterization, place it carefully on the fistula itself, once and twice if needed, until you reach the depth of the fistula. If the fistula is small, then make the cautery iron to the size of the fistula.
Then leave it for three days and apply cotton soaked in butter to it until what was burned by the fire is gone. Then treat it with ointment and tents until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On cauterization for hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If humors overwhelm the trachea, especially if this is accompanied by a cold temperament, then the patient should first be purged with laxative medicines, then cauterize with a cautery iron in the pit of the neck at the root of the throat in the lower position.
Be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery and do not burn more than half of the skin.  Then cauterize again at the joint of the neck at the end of its last vertebra, and let the cautery be nail-shaped in the manner previously described.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterizing lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize two places above the clavicles in the low, soft, empty places, and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And the cautery should be a nail-shaped instrument, in the manner previously described.  And if you wish, let your cautery be by puncturing with the instrument called the "nuqta," the form of which has been previously shown in puncturing earache, and let the punctures be from thirty points or thereabouts.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he recovers.  You may also make a cautery with three branches in this form, and it hastens the cauterization because you cauterize three places at once with it. And this is the form of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated because of slippery humors, or if it does not remain in place when it is reduced from its dislocation, so that it becomes habitual to relapse and then dislocate at the slightest movement as we have witnessed, then it is necessary to reduce the joint first. Then the patient lies on his back or on his healthy side, then the skin inside the armpit is raised upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint has dislocated inwards.
Then heat the cautery iron with two heads, whose image is this.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will be four cauterizations.  It may be cauterized with a cautery iron with three heads; then the shape of the cauterization will be six cauterizations, and the heads should be fine.
And this is the image of the cautery iron with three heads.
And one may be added to this number, making the cauterizations eight. Then, apply to the cauterization balls pounded with salt, then keep the patient still and do not move the limb for a time until it strengthens. If the dislocation is upwards, which is rarely the case,
cauterize above the shoulder one good, nail-like cauterization, or many cauterizations in a dotted pattern, for the joint will strengthen, the moisture will leave, and the patient will heal.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In cauterizing the stomach.
If coldness and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, to the extent that it is deranged and many catarrhs occur in it, and it is treated with various treatments without success, then the patient should lie on his back, extending his legs and arms, then three cauterizations should be performed. One cauterization below the pit of the stomach, the size of a finger, with a nail-like cautery, and two cauterizations below on either side of the first cauterization, so that the shape of the cauterizations is triangular, and further apart so that they do not meet if they suppurate; and the depth of the cauterization should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and this is the shape of the cauterizations.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cautery with which you cauterize this single cauterization should be circular in shape, in this manner.
And the stomach may be cauterized with dots for one who is afraid of this cauterization; and that is to mark dots on the stomach with ink to the extent that you desire, then cauterize it with a dot-like cautery, then treat it with the treatment that has been mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
In the cold cauterization of the liver.
If there appears from the liver a pain due to coldness and dampness, or due to a subtle wind, so that it has departed from its natural temperament excessively, and the patient has been treated with what we mentioned in the division, and that did not benefit. Then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and three cauterizations should be marked with ink in this shape and this exact amount on the liver, below the ribs where the elbow of a person ends.
And after each cauterization, there should be a cauterization the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization should be straight along the body, and do not press down hard with the cautery iron.
And let the amount of thickness of skin that you burn be half, no more. And let the patient stand on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him be lying down with his legs extended and his arms raised. And this is the image of the cautery iron.
And you may be able to cauterize these cauterizations with a knife-like cautery iron if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be careful lest you overdo the cauterization and burn all the skin, and burn the abdomen and reach the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so know this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
In cauterizing a swelling of the liver.
If an abscess appears in the liver and you want to know if that swelling is in the flesh of the liver or in its peritoneum, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the peritoneum of the liver, there will be intense sharpness with the pain, and you see that the physicians have been exhausted in treating it, then the patient should lie on his back, then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire; it is the cautery that resembles a awl, and this is its image. And cauterize it with one cauterization until you burn all the skin and the cauterization reaches the peritoneum until all the matter comes out, then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should not be used except by one whose training in medicine has been long and who has experienced these diseases many times by practice; then he may undertake such work, but leaving it is better in my opinion.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with the roots of rhubarb for a cold fistula in this way: that you take one long, dry root of rhubarb, the longest you can find, and it should be about the thickness of a finger, then dip it in oil and hold it in the fire. Then apply one cauterization between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauterizations a little below the jugular veins, slightly inclined towards the side under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two cauterizations also between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined backwards, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest and another above the stomach, and three cauterizations on the back: one between the shoulders and two on either side of the spine, below the cauterization which is between the shoulders.
And you should not deepen your hand with the cautery, but it should be a superficial burning of the skin. Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used a hot iron instrument, like a file, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reaches the tumor itself.
And it removes the matter, as we mentioned in liver tumors.  In this method, cauterization is dangerous; either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops at the site which will not heal.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you treat the spleen ailment with the treatments mentioned in the division and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is done in three ways, all correct. One is to cauterize it three or four times in a row along the length of the spleen.
In the shape of the liver cauterizations whose shape we presented, and between each cauterization and the next is the width of a finger or a little more.  The quality of the cautery is the same as that which we mentioned in cauterizing the liver, and do not deepen your hand with the cautery. The patient's position is lying on his back.
The other method is in the elbow, and you raise the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends, and you raise the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left elbow ends, and your raising of the skin is across the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then you insert two cautery irons, very hot, until you pass them through the skin on the other side. Then you remove the cautery irons, and the cauterizations will be four. And if you wish, you cauterize with the other cautery iron with three points.
Then you treat the site of the cauterization after you leave it to drain pus for many days; this is more effective than all the previous treatments.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial in ascitic dropsy specifically. If you treat the patient with dropsy using the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, one on the spleen, and two on his back between the vertebrae—one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the cauterization open to drain pus for a long time.
And do not deprive the patient of treatment after cauterization with what is necessary to combine the two meanings for him, so that healing may be hastened. The shape of the cauterizing iron with which the back is cauterized is nail-shaped, as its form has preceded. And that with which the abdomen is cauterized is olive-shaped.
Chapter thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the hollow between the little finger and the ring finger.
And place your hand with the cautery iron and do not bend it, then raise your hand and do not return it at all, for the yellow water will exude, and the cautery iron is of this form.
Then cauterize on the legs, two cauterizations on each leg, and the cauterization should be with the sharp end of the cautery iron, and the cauterization should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below that towards the middle of the leg, and on each thigh two cauterizations.
And leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, so that the water exudes from it, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and dampness, so that it weakens the binding and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various treatments and it has not healed, and you see that the patient can tolerate cauterization and is strong enough, then cauterize him with a large cauterization on his stomach. As was previously mentioned in cauterizing the stomach with the circular cautery iron, and four cauterizations around the navel with a gentle, nail-like cautery iron, and one or two large cauterizations on the cotton above the coccyx.
If you see that the dampness is abundant and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize him on the pubis and on each flank, and perhaps add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one; for this is a successful treatment whose benefit is not missed, God willing.
Chapter thirty-four.
On cauterizing the hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are chronic, numerous, or single hemorrhoids in the anus, and they are from thick, cold humors or corrupt dampness, and they have been treated with what we mentioned in the classification, but the treatment has not been effective, then cauterize the patient with three cauterizations on the lower part of the sacrum, slightly below the table, in a triangular pattern.
And a cauterization below the navel, about two fingers wide. And if you judge that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization as previously mentioned, and a cauterization on his liver. And another on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery.  And leave the cautery open for a time, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the cauterization of warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery which resembles a needle, then insert it, hot, into the same cut wart, and continue until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which the blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described, then treat them with suitable ointments until they heal. And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on cotton, it will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On the cauterization of fistulas which are in the anus and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the procedure we described in its place and shrinks from it, then perhaps he will heal by cauterization. If a fistula occurs and pus and foul moisture flow from it for a long time, then the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then know its depth with the probe, then heat the cautery which resembles a needle, then insert it, hot, into the fistula itself, along the course of the fistula and to the depth that the probe entered, and repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once or twice or three times, according to your need.
And be careful not to burn a nerve if there is one, or a large vein, and if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine.
Therefore, be careful of all these places.  You only do this if the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you have determined that it is not penetrating. Then treat the place until it heals. If the place closes and the materials cease and it remains so for a time, then know that it has healed completely.
And if the materials do not cease from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that in its depth there is a corrupt bone, or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On cauterizing the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or a strong wind, and the patient's sexual function is diminished because of that, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the loins, on the kidney itself, one cauterization on each kidney, with the nail-shaped cautery previously mentioned.  Perhaps you may cauterize a third time on the same area, so that there will be three cauterizations in a row, which will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder from cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it with one cauterization below the navel, on the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and one cauterization to the right of the navel and another to the left.
The distance after cauterization on each side should be the width of a thumb joint.  Cauterize one or two times in the lower back if necessary; the cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On cauterizing the womb.
If a substance from cold and dampness occurs in the womb, thereby preventing conception, corrupting its flow, and hindering its function, or if pain occurs in it during menstruation, then three cauterizations should be made around the navel, as was mentioned in cauterizing the bladder. One or two cauterizations on the cotton in the lower back; the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Erroneous, mucous humors may accumulate in the hip joint, causing it to dislocate.  The sign is that one leg is longer than the other when they are measured against each other, and a void is found at the site of the dislocation.  Therefore, a semi-circular cauterization should be performed on the affected area of the hip joint itself.
After you have drawn a circle around the joint with ink, so that the joint itself falls in the middle of the circle, use the cautery whose image is shown in the cauterization of the stomach. If you do not have this cautery, perform three cauterizations with the large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cauterization as deep as the entire thickness of the skin, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-one.
On cauterizing sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint, and the cause is cold and dampness, and you have treated the patient as mentioned in the classification, and the treatment has not worked, and the condition has become chronic, then it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors with fetid acacia or prickly pear fruit, or something similar.
Then, shave it and apply cautery in two ways: either cautery with burning medicines or cautery with fire. Cautery with fire can be done in many ways; one of them is to cauterize the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
Make them of a suitable depth, and the distance between each cauterization should be the width of a finger.  The cautery iron should be olive-shaped.  You may also cauterize one in the middle, at the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations.  Or, if you wish, cauterize it in the circle previously mentioned in the cauterization for hip dislocation, with one cauterization.
So that the circle encloses the entire hip and burns through the entire thickness of the skin. This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize two places on the thigh where the patient indicates pain, and one cauterization above the malleolus, four finger-widths towards the lateral side slightly. The cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.
If he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize where he indicates with a pointed cautery iron, three or four times, or more if necessary. If he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to burn a nerve or a large artery, lest you cause the patient a bad or lasting injury.
And I have seen one and another who were cauterized above the malleolus, and the cauterization was excessive, so that the leg became gangrenous, until the gangrene reached the foot and perforated it entirely, and the whole leg was corrupted, and then diarrhea and death followed. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize both in the same way.
Some learned physicians have mentioned a cauterization of the hip of this kind:  A cup-like instrument is made of iron, its diameter half a span, and its mouth the thickness of a date pit, or slightly less, and within this cup another cup, and a third cup.
And the distance between each cup is the width of a thumb joint. The cups are open on both sides, and their height is about one or two finger joints. A handle of iron is firmly attached to the cups. This is its image.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, then it is placed on the hip joint, the patient lying on his sound side, and three circular cauterizations are performed at once. Then he is left for three days, and the wound is dressed with butter, and the wound is left open for some days.
Many, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The author of this book says: We rarely used this type of cauterization because of its ugliness and the horror of its appearance, and because few are found who can endure it, except that it is a good cauterization for those who endure it and whose condition is suitable for it.
As for cauterization with burning drugs, it is done by making two cup-like instruments similar to the rings through which the door hinges descend, from copper or iron.
Their rims are raised about two finger joints or so, and the distance between them is about the thickness of a finger. They are open at the bottom and open at the top, and are held together in this manner.
Then you place them on the hip joint, the patient lying on his sound side, and you firmly hold your hand, then you pour between the circles some sharp water, which has been warmed a little over the fire, and hold it for the duration of an hourglass. The patient must endure its stinging and burning, for he will feel a burning like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then you raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the sharp water from the entire hip with fresh water, then you leave it for three days and apply butter to it until the blackness of the burn disappears, and you leave it for days so that pus may drain from it, for this is most effective.
Then you treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, you make for it a mold to hold the water, in the same way that you did for the hip.  This is the description of the sharp water, which I have already described in the chapter on the preparation of drugs.
Take of potash and of unslaked lime, one part of each; pound them and place them in a new pot which has been pierced at its bottom with one small hole, the size that a small probe can enter. Place another glazed pot under the bottom of the pot.
And pour on the potash and lime enough fresh water to cover them by a finger’s breadth, after you have pressed them well with your hand. Leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the glazed pot below. Then collect all that water and pour it onto more lime and potash, freshly prepared.
For then it will be extremely sharp, and serves in many medical procedures and in cauterizing various members, because it acts exactly like fire.  Among the drugs which also cauterize the hip are thapsia, honey of spurge, and lime with soap, well mixed.
Galen recounts, from an ancient man, a treatment for hip pain and sciatica, and greatly magnified its importance, claiming that no other treatment is needed and that it cures with a single application.
To the point that one might enter the bath carried and leave cured.  This is done by taking fresh green  celandine—if fresh is not available, take newly dried—and finely grinding it with a little fat, and applying it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg, or thigh.
It is bound on and left for three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning cease. Then he is put in the bath, and when his body is damp, he is put in the tub. The pain will go away and he will be cured, God willing. If he is not cured, repeat the application after ten days.
Then, God willing, he will be cured. Know that no one should use cautery with these drugs except after evacuating the body. Dioscorides mentioned that goat hair, if used to cauterize sciatica, is beneficial.
The cautery is done in this way: wool is taken and soaked in old oil, and placed on the deep place between the thumb of the hand and the forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat hair.
Heat it in the fire until it becomes a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. Then take another and continue doing this until sensation reaches, through the humerus, to the hip and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cautery is called goat-hair cautery.
Chapter forty-two.
Concerning the cautery of backache.
Pain may occur in the back from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like.  It may be from the effusion of a cold, moist substance. Cautery is only done in this type alone.
That which is from the effusion of a cold substance, it is necessary after the patient has vomited with hellebore and the like, that he be cauterized on his back where the pain is, three rows across the width of the table itself, after marking the place with ink. In each row, five cauterizations or more, according to what you see the patient can tolerate and his strength.
And the cautery is done with a needle cautery, and if you wish, cauterize with three or four medium-sized nail cauteries in this manner.
Chapter forty-three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
This illness often affects small children, and its initial sign in a child is that he experiences shortness of breath upon standing and movement, and you find at the end of his spinal vertebrae a bead that has protruded, standing out from the other beads.
If you see that and want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery iron in this manner. Let the cautery take hold on each side of the vertebra evenly; and if you wish, cauterize it around the vertebra with a pointed cautery iron, in two or three rows, and let the points be close to one another.  Then treat the area until it heals, as we have described.
And be careful not to use cautery in a hump that is caused by nerve tension.
Chapter forty-four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are due to cold humors that descend to any member of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, physicians usually call this gout in particular.
If the gout, which is cold in origin, is treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification, and the pains do not go away, then cauterization will remove them.  This is done by cauterizing around the joint of the legs with many cauterizations after evacuation. The cautery should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, in this manner.
And if you need to cauterize the surface of the leg, do so with a pointed cautery. If the pains ascend to the knees or to the other joints—and this often happens—cauterize each knee with three or four cauterizations on each side with the same olive-shaped cautery.
If you need more cauterization than this, cauterize, but do not deepen your cauterization, rather it should be only about the thickness of the skin.  If the pains ascend to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned concerning cauterization in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, cauterize around the forearms as if circling two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, cauterize each knuckle with a point, and the metacarpus. If the pains ascend after some days to the elbows or shoulders,
cauterize them on each side.  The patient should not be without good management and the taking of medicines, for if he improves his diet and evacuates the phlegm, he will be cured with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the cauterization of hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some of the intestine and fat descends to the testicle, and this is recent and beginning, then you should order the patient to abstain from food that day and to use laxatives to evacuate the bowels.
Then he should lie on his back in front of you, and you should tell him to restrain himself until the fat or intestine protrudes, then you should return it with your finger.  Then you should mark with ink below the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a semicircle, its ends towards the upper part of the body.
Then you heat a cautery of this shape.
Until it becomes white and throws off sparks. Then you return the intestine or fat to the abdomen. Then an assistant places his hand on the place so that the intestine does not protrude.  And you have parted the patient's legs and placed a cushion under him, and another assistant ties his legs.
And another on his chest holds his hands. Then you lower the cautery onto the same mark, and your hand with the cautery is upright and straight, and you hold it until it reaches the bone, or repeat it again if it does not reach the bone the first time.
And you should guard against the protrusion of the intestine while cauterizing, lest you burn it, which would cause the patient either death or a great calamity. And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed. And the cautery should be gentle for children according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then you treat the cauterized area after three days with butter, until the scabs from the fire are gone. Then you treat it with other ointments until it heals. And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is closed.
And you should make his diet during his treatment such that it softens his bowels, lest the intestine protrude during straining and defecation. Then, if he wishes to get up after forty days, you use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days. And he should reduce exertion, fullness from food and drink, and loud shouting.
For if this procedure is used in this way, he will heal completely, God willing. And I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing. As for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is incipient, if you wish to prevent it from increasing, cauterize a round area around it. Let what you burn of the skin be about two-thirds of it. Then treat it as we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing. And some of the ancients mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After you mark the hernia with ink, making the horizontal line at the top of the hernia and the other line below, and you put down your hand in the middle with one nail-shaped cautery. And the first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter forty-six.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If pain occurs in some member from a fall or a blow, and that pain lasts a long time, and treatment with medicines does not work, then it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery.  And the cauterization of each member should be according to its size, whether small or large, and its weakness or strength.
And if the pain and fistula persist, then if it heals from the first cauterization, that is well and good; otherwise, repeat the cauterization upon it, for it is the nature of these pains to move from one member to what is near it. Therefore, it should be followed by cauterization until the patient is healed.
Chapter forty-seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for lepers, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that comes from putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize, observe whether the leprosy is incipient. If you have treated it with what we mentioned in the classification, and it has not lessened nor stopped, and you fear that corruption will take over the entire temperament of the patient, then cauterize the head with five cauterizations. One in the middle of the head as is customary, the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two on the temples, and one at the back on the nape of the neck.  Deepen your cauterization slightly so that it affects the bone a little.
And scales will be removed from it, so that the thick vapors may easily escape from it. Cauterize also the spleen in the same manner as mentioned above. But if the leprosy has persisted in the patient and appeared manifestly, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauterizations which we mentioned on the head. And a cauterization on the tip of the nose, two cauterizations on the cheeks, two cauterizations on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the spine, and another above it in the same region, and two on the hips, one on each hip. And two on the knees, one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the breasts, and cauterize each joint of the fingers of his hands and feet with a cauterization, and each heel of his feet and forearms.
And guard against the nerve which is on the back of the heels lest you burn them.  A cauterization may also be applied to the pubic bone, another to the pit of the stomach, and another to the liver. And know that the more cauterizations you add, the more useful and effective it will be.
And know that the patient does not feel the pain of the cauterization as the healthy person does, because his body is numb.  And the cauteries should be large and small according to the limbs and joints, as described above for the types of cautery irons.
Then treat the cauterization with crushed barley flour mixed with honey and other treatments until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-eight.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness: When a limb becomes numb and is treated with medications, ointments, and bandages but does not heal, cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the limb, whether large or small. Let your cauterization penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  And it may be that some numbness affecting the hand and foot is cauterized in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, and the numbness will go away.
And let none undertake this except one who is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter forty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of vitiligo.
If vitiligo is longstanding and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it slightly, to the depth of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil,  plantain leaves, and pigeon's blood or the blood of sparrows; one part of each. Mix them all together, apply to a cloth, and bind it to the place until it heals.
Chapter fifty.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is incipient and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it extends. Some scholars have mentioned that a deep cauterization should be performed in its center, but I do not see that, because I expect it to ulcerate, and I have witnessed this many times.
Therefore, the correct method is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we said, or with many cauterizations.
Chapter fifty-one.
Concerning the cauterization of the fistula.
If a fistula occurs and is slow to mature, either because of the causative agent, or because of the patient's age if he is old and anemic, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the fistula, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations, puncturing it.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.  If you wish to stop it with cauterization, take the cautery whose image is this.
And insert it into the middle of the fistula until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be from what is below, so that the flow of pus is easier, then treat it as is appropriate until it heals.
Chapter fifty-two.
On cauterizing the ulcer.
An ulcer is a corruption that spreads in the member and consumes it, just as fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then take many small and large, nail-shaped cauteries according to what suits that place where the ulcer is.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing at all remains, then leave it for three days and apply to the cauterized areas powdered sulfur with oil until all the eschar and all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with ointments that grow flesh. If you see after three days that the flesh grows healthy and without corruption, otherwise repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupt areas.  An ulcer may also be treated with a sharp medicine.
For it acts in place of fire, more quickly beneficial. And I have mentioned its treatment with sharp medicine in the section; take it from there when you need it.
Chapter fifty-three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This ailment frequently occurs on the soles of the feet; it is a rough thing that pains the person.  Cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a sharp liquid.
As for cauterization with fire, you heat a hollow cautery iron, similar to an eagle's feather, made of iron to the extent that it surrounds the nail on all sides, and it should be thin-edged. Then you lower it, hot, onto the nail, and then you rotate your hand with the cautery iron around the nail until the cautery iron reaches the depth of the nail.
And you leave it for three days, it will suppurate, then you dress it with pounded wild bread (خبازى البرّيّة) mixed with salt, and you leave the dressing on it overnight. Then it will be removed from its roots.  Then you treat the wound site with a flesh-growing ointment until it heals, if the nails are not inverted.
This frequently occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet.  Therefore you should take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's feather, and lower it onto the nail or wart, then pour a little of the sharp liquid into the tube.
And hold your hand as you rotate it, with a slight twitch of your hand, so that the edge of the tube affects the root of the nail, and the sharp liquid finds a way to penetrate to the root of the nail. The patient should endure the stinging of the sharp liquid for a short while.
Then leave it; the nail will be removed from its roots.  Do this one by one until you have dealt with all of them on the body. Then treat the areas after they are removed with ointments that grow flesh.
Chapter fifty-four.
On cauterizing scabies.
If someone develops scabies from a cold in the nerve or from a quartan fever or something else, then you should cauterize it four or five times on the vertebrae of the back, with one cauterization between each vertebra, and one cauterization on his chest. And one cauterization on his stomach with an olive-shaped cautery iron, for scabies will subside and the cold disease will quickly mature.
Chapter fifty-five.
On cauterizing pustules that occur on the body.
Ugly pustules may erupt on the body, arising from cold, thick, corrupt substances.  At their first appearance, each pustule should be gently cauterized with a slender cautery iron, the end of which has been heated in the fire, or with a long cautery iron shaped like a reed, or with a lentil-shaped cautery iron.
And boils may be cauterized at their first eruption in this manner, so that the active cause does not increase and the harmful substance dissipates and the patient recovers. However, this should be done after the patient has been bled.
Chapter fifty-six.
On cauterizing hemorrhage that occurs when an artery is severed.
Hemorrhage often occurs from a severed artery during a wound inflicted from the outside, or during the incision of a tumor, or the cauterization of a member, and so forth, and its arrest is difficult.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the mouth of the artery and press firmly so that the blood is contained beneath your finger and nothing emerges. Then place several small and large olive-sized cauteries in the fire and heat them until they are extremely hot.
Then take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery is severed.  Quickly remove your finger and apply the cautery to the same vessel and hold it until the bleeding stops.
If, upon removing your finger from the mouth of the artery, the bleeding resumes and the cautery goes out, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire, and continue doing this, one after another, until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve that is there, lest another affliction befall the patient.  Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization, as we have said; or by amputation if it has not already been severed; for if it is severed, its ends contract and the bleeding stops; or by tightly tying it with threads; or by applying medications that stop bleeding and tightening with bandages firmly.
And as for one who attempts to stop it with a ligature, or by tightening with cloths, or by applying burning substances, and the like, it will not be stopped in this way at all, except rarely. If this happens to someone and a physician or medicine is not at hand, he should immediately place his index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
And he should tighten it very hard until the blood is constricted and flows from above the wound and onto the artery. The finger should not be removed from it, constantly applying very cold water until the blood clots, thickens, and stops.  In the meantime, look for whatever is needed in the way of cautery or medicine.
Chapter Two.
Concerning incisions, punctures, bloodletting, wounds, and the like.
Khalaf said: In the first chapter we mentioned every ailment for which cauterization with fire and burning medicine is suitable, and its causes, reasons, instruments, and types of cautery instruments, arranging that from head to foot in sections.
And I follow in this chapter the same method, so that the student may easily obtain what he seeks.
Before I begin with that, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains more subtleties than the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that, caution should be greater, for in this chapter, the practice often involves the loss of blood which sustains life, when opening a vein or making an incision on a tumor or lancing an abscess, or treating a wound, or removing an arrow, or incising a stone, and the like, all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and in most of them, death occurs.
And I advise you against undertaking what is doubtful, for in this art, various kinds of people with various kinds of illnesses may come to you; among them are those who have grown weary of their illness and have come to disregard death.
Because of the severity of their illness and the length of their suffering, and the illness has reached a stage which indicates death; and there are some who will give you their money and enrich you with it in hope of health, and their illness is mortal; therefore, you should absolutely not cooperate with anyone who is in this condition.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not undertake anything of this kind unless you have certain knowledge of what will lead to a favorable outcome, and in all the treatment of your patients, use foresight and warning of what will lead to safety.
For in that you will have help in acquiring praise, glory, mention and thanks. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance and may He not deprive you of correctness and success; surely that is in His hand, there is no god but He.
And I have arranged the chapters of this section in the same manner as in the section on cauterization, from head to foot, so that what you want from it may be easier for you, God willing.
Chapter One.
In the treatment of the water which gathers in the heads of infants.
This ailment often occurs to infants at birth if the midwife presses the infant's head without gentleness, and it may also occur from a hidden cause which is not known.
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone except infants, and all those whom I have seen afflicted by it have quickly died; therefore I have considered abandoning treatment for it. And I have seen an infant whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger each day. Until the infant could not sit up on his own because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he perished.
And this moisture either gathers between the skin and the bone, or it gathers under the bone on the membrane.  The treatment, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, is that one should make a single horizontal incision in the middle of the head, the length of the incision being about two finger-breadths, so that the moisture flows out. This is a picture of the lancet.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling is larger, then make two intersecting incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is under the bone—and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side and the water subsides if you press it with your hand inwards, and this is not hidden from you—then one should make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
After the incision, all the moisture comes out, then you bind the incisions with rags and bandages, then you bathe it from above with syrup and oil until the fifth day. Then you untie the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments. Do not neglect to bind the head moderately, and feed the patient with any dry food that contains little moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals. Another description of the incision is that you look where the bone of the swelling and the gathering of the water appear, for it may be more in the back of the head, or in its front, or on the right, or on the left.
Then aim the incision where the swelling and the fullness of the water appear to you, and incise it as you are able, and be careful not to cut an artery, lest bleeding occur and the patient die from that bleeding along with the evacuation of the moisture.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears, known as the mastoid arteries.
When someone is afflicted with severe colds in the eyes or chest, and this has persisted and medication has not been effective, then the most effective treatment is to cut these two arteries.
Then, if you wish to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the artery appears, then tie the patient's neck with the edge of his garment, then look where the pulse beats and their location, the two hidden places behind the ears, and they are rarely hidden except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with a sharp scalpel, cutting to the bone. This should be done across the head; and if you wish, you may insert the scalpel from under the artery and cut upwards. The length of the cut should be about two fingers' breadth.
If the artery is cut, the blood will spurt forth in a pulsating flow, leaping forward repeatedly. If the artery is not palpable, then you should measure three fingerbreadths from the ear, then mark it with ink and incise to the bone.  What should be...
Let six ounces of blood flow out on average; and perhaps more or less will flow, all depending on the strength of the patient and the fullness of his arteries. Then look at the wound; if there remains any peritoneum on the bone, cut it away.
Lest a hot inflammation occur. Then bind the wound with a linen thread, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
In ligating the two arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic migraine or acute attacks caused by sharp humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headache, and so on, and he has been treated with various medical treatments without success, then we have tried in these diseases ligating the arteries of the temples or cauterizing them as we described.
The method of ligating them is to shave the hair from the temples of the patient and to locate the artery visible in the temple, for it will be apparent to you from its pulsation, and it rarely hides except in a few people.
Or, in severe cold, if it is hidden from you, let the patient tighten his neck with the excess of his garment, then you rub the area with a cloth or compress the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly and obviously. Then take the scalpel, whose image is this. Then you incise the skin gently with it until you reach the artery, then you place a hook in it and pull it upwards until you bring it out of the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it on all sides; if the artery is thin, then twist it with the end of the hook. Then cut off a portion of it to the extent that its ends are separated and contract, and do not cause bleeding; for if it is not severed and cut, the blood will not flow at all; then it is evacuated from blood from six ounces to three.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread; and let the thread be either of silk or of lute strings, lest corruption quickly reach it before the wound heals and bleeding occurs.
Then cut what is between the ligatures; do this at that time or after another time; and if you wish to cauterize it with a cautery to the bone with a knife-cautery until its ends are severed, this will serve the same purpose or better, as we said.
Unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, for cauterization is something that helps in eliminating humors and is thus surer in benefit.  After ligating the arteries, the area should be packed with old cotton and firm bandages applied; after healing, treatment with dry medications that generate flesh and with sutures should continue until it is healed, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your work, quickly cut it, either by cautery, or by filling the area with vitriol and pressing firmly until the bleeding stops. If you do not have any of that at hand, place your finger there until the blood clots.
Then wash the area with very cold water until the sharpness subsides and bind it as necessary. What is easier and simpler than ligating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the two areas with ink.
Apply it very hot until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed in two places so that the ends are separated, for it will not reunite with this cautery at all.  This is an image of the cautery.
The blades should be sharp, resembling small scalpels, except that they should be much less sharp than a scalpel; for if they are as sharp as a scalpel, they will cool down more quickly and the flesh will not be severed quickly. If there is some thickness to them, the heat of the fire will remain in them.
And the flesh is cut quickly. This procedure is better than any other, and is lighter and easier. Let the distance between the blades be the width of a finger.
Chapter Four.
In the treatment of the constant flow of hot tears into the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins on the cranium from the outside, and nothing from medical treatment with drugs has benefited, and you see the patient's face is red. And he feels in his forehead a crawling like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their lids are eroded and their eyelids are drawn together from the intensity of the tears.  Therefore, the ancients in treating it resorted to this procedure, and they called it treatment with the scalpel. It is that you order the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then you make three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead. The length of each incision is about two fingers, one incision parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second a little distance from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from the junction of the jaws.  The distance between each incision should be about three fingers, held together. And have with you prepared pieces of sponge or many dry cloths to wipe the blood.
Then insert the double-edged scalpel, whose image is this. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, and with it, you dissect all the skin between the two incisions along with the periosteum on the bone. Then you also do that from the middle incision to the third incision. Then remove this scalpel. And also insert into the first incision another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth, not sharp, on the other; and this is its image:
And place its sharp side upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do that in the middle incision to the other incision.  After a moderate amount of blood flows, squeeze the places of the clotted blood. Then place in each incision a cotton wick, and put on it a dressing moistened with syrup and oil, or vinegar and oil.
So that a hot swelling does not occur. On the third day, remove the bandage and use much cleansing with lukewarm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and whatever else you treat wounds with until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from the interior of the head.
When someone experiences frequent, sharp, severe, constant discharges, and you see his eyes weak, small, his vision weakened, his eyelids ulcerated, and the eyelashes falling out. And there is severe, painful pain in the depth of the head and continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment is this: order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is severe, painful pain in the depth of the head and continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment is this: order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or slightly higher across, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, making the incision to the bone, and keep your hand away from the temporal muscles that move when chewing, until the bone is exposed and all the blood is dried with a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with old cotton or linen threads, and then bind it from above with bandages, and soak the bandages with syrup and oil, lest a hot swelling occur. And when you remove them and see that the hot swelling has subsided, then you should scrape the bone until the growth of flesh begins.
Then treat it with a drying preparation that grows flesh, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and preparing an ointment from them, and using it in the growth of flesh in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or a semi-stone like iron and glass, or a plant seed like chickpeas and kernels and the like, or a flowing substance like water and vinegar and the like.
Or an animal.  If a stone or a kind of stone falls into the ear that does not grow in the ear, then expose the ear to the sun.  If you see the stone, then instill some violet oil or cerate into it, then try to remove it by moving the head or sneezing with a handkerchief. And close the nostrils when sneezing comes, after placing a ring of rags or wool around the ear and extending the ear upwards. Often it comes out with this treatment. If it does not come out otherwise, then try to remove it with the gentle scoop, whose image is this.
If it comes out with the scoop, otherwise try to remove it with a gentle, slightly curved, blind probe. If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole gently.
And seal around the tube with pitch softened with oil, lest there be a path for the air other than the tube, then draw it with your breath strongly, and often it comes out with that. If it does not come out with what we described, then take a little of the Nabataean mastic or of the prepared mastic which is used by birds, and place it on the end of the probe.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, then insert it into the ear hole gently after drying the ear from moisture. If it does not come out by all that we have described, then proceed to incision before the hot swelling or tetanus occurs.
The description of the incision is that you first bleed the patient in the cephalic vein and let out blood according to his strength. Then you seat the patient before you, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near its lobe in the lowest part of it.
And the incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can, then quickly stitch the incision at once and treat it until it heals.
And if the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, then try to remove it as we have mentioned. If it does not respond to removal, then take a thin, delicate scalpel of this shape.
And try with it to cut that type of seed that has fallen into the ear.  You only do this if you are certain that the seed has become moistened by the vapor of the ear until it becomes many small pieces, then remove them with a blind probe or with a fine sponge or by suction.
As we mentioned, then it is easy to remove them. As for water entering the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with hellebore, having filled his ear with some worn cotton while lying on the ear that contains the water. If it comes out with that,
otherwise, take many small, smooth, flat stones the length of the fingers, warm them slightly by fire, and the patient inserts one into the opening of his ear and hops on one foot on that side and strikes the stone in the ear with another stone.
He continues to do this with one stone after another until all the water comes out. The water may also come out by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear, and applying the other end to fire until most of it burns, then repeating with another feather.
Do this repeatedly until all the water comes out or draw it out with a tube as previously described for the stone. As for removing an animal that has entered, see if it is small, like a flea or similar. Treat it as mentioned in the section, and as for...
If its body is large and perceptible to the touch, try removing it with forceps and hooks. This is easier than anything else that lodges in the ear. As for removing worms that develop in the ear, if you treat it with what we mentioned in the section on instillations and your treatment is not effective,
you should look into the ear in the sun. If you see something of the worms, remove them with forceps or fine hooks. If you do not see anything, take a tube of this shape.
narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, and insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate. Then suck strongly. Do this repeatedly until all the worms come out. If it does not come out, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned to you for the stone.
If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, use the instillations that I have mentioned. The ancients have tried them in killing worms, and you will find that in the section on instillations.  Pouring oils and medicines into the ear is done with this instrument, and this is its image:
As you see, make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top. If you wish, the nozzle inside the tube can be made of tightly fitting copper. If you wish, take a reed and wrap cotton tightly around one end.
Then pour the oil or juice or whatever medicine you want into the tube while it is in the ear. Then insert the reed with the cotton from above and squeeze it with your hand moderately until the oil is driven into the ear cavity and it is felt.
by the patient inside. Let what you pour into the ear be warmed slightly in the fire. Be careful that what is dropped into it is neither very cold nor very hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
In the treatment of the obstruction affecting the ear.
Some children may be born with their ear canals not perforated.
It may also happen that some people experience an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or a growth. This obstruction may be deep within the ear canal, invisible to the eye.
It may also present slightly outside the opening and be visible. That which presents deep within the ear and is not visible is, in most cases, difficult to see.  That which is visible, however, should have the patient's ear placed in the sun. And examine it; if you see the obstruction clearly, open it with a delicate scalpel, which is of this form:
Its tip should be slightly broad, and the rest of the scalpel smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear. If the obstruction is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate hook and cut it gently but firmly until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a smooth, slender probe, warm it slightly in the fire, and insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction, and the patient feels heaviness in hearing, remove it gently.
Take care not to injure the membrane of the ear. Then insert into the ear a tent corresponding to the size of the opening, having smeared it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure the wound has healed. Or, take a tent, moisten it with water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it.
Use this. If you see that the ear has swollen with a hot inflammation, it is necessary to remove the tent and replace it with another tent smeared with a poultice made with rose oil, so that the hot inflammation subsides. Then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear. Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding mentioned in the chapter on haemostatics.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts which appear on the eyelids.
These warts which appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  It is necessary to grasp them with forceps or a hook and cut them from their roots with a scalpel, then apply powdered verdigris to the area.
If they bleed, cauterize them with a mild lentil-shaped cautery. Cauterization is better after cutting. They often return if any of their roots remain; if cauterized with fire, these roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of the cold which affects the eyelids.
Often something resembling a cold in its intensity and hardness appears in the eyelids.
Therefore it is called a cold, and it is a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The treatment is to look: if the cold is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves in every direction, then the matter is easy, so make a transverse incision on it.
Then carefully peel it from every side until it is released, then hang it with a hook and cut it. If you cannot cut it except after the eyelid has been penetrated by the cut, that will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, then bring it together with sutures and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, then there is no harm from it, for ointment will heal and join it. If the cold is inclined towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn back the eyelid and hang the cold with a hook without needing an incision, and excise it from every side.
If it penetrates the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting the cold with salt water and treat the area with something that joins until the patient heals.
Chapter Ten.
In the treatment of the pterygium which appears in the eyelid.
Pterygium is a fleshy growth in the layers of the upper eyelid, and this mostly happens to children. It weighs down their eyes, causing them to suffer from colds at night, and they cannot look at sunlight. Because the tears flow quickly to them.
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces and sleeping on them, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, with a swelling upon them, and the pterygium is clearly visible. When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the pterygium between them. The procedure is to have the patient place his head in your lap.
Then you take a linen cloth and prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick to the extent that it surrounds the pterygium on every side, then you place it on it and press with your fingers from every side to gather the pterygium in the middle of the circle.
Then you make a transverse incision in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, and the incision should not be larger than the incision made in bloodletting.  As for the depth, you should cut all the skin until you reach the pterygium.
Then, in most cases, the pterygium protrudes from the incision in the form of a white fatty piece. You pull it out with a cloth wrapped between your fingers, while you turn your hand right and left until it is cured. Beware of increasing the incision, lest the lancet reach the eye and harm it.
If the pterygium does not appear to you in the first incision, you should gently increase the incision a little until the pterygium protrudes, then pull it as we said. Then, dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area and bandage it. Some people crush salt.
And they place it inside the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of eyelid surgery.
If extra eyelids grow on the eyelid, contrary to the natural course, under the natural eyelids and eyelashes, then they harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, whiteness, and thickening, until it becomes a cause of blindness.
Eyelid surgery is performed in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or with a strong medicine as previously described in the chapter on cauterization, or by cutting and suturing, or with a reed, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it does not turn, then insert a needle with a thread from under the eyelid, and pass the needle with the thread from above, near the hair itself, and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.
Turn it with a probe, then incise the inside of the eyelid below the excess hair with a sharp scalpel, from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, then remove the thread and place a small pledget of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, then mark the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of a laurel leaf, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to raise the eyelid, because this varies among people; some need you to cut a suitable amount from the eyelid according to how much the eyelid has relaxed.
And some need less cutting, all of this according to the relaxation of the eyelid. Then incise with the scalpel along the two lines that you have marked, beginning from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, and each incision should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of a probe.
Then insert the hook into one corner of the skin, then peel it all off, then bring together the edges with sutures using a fine woolen needle and thread, wipe away the blood, and stick the remaining threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substance.
If you wish to do that, otherwise it does not matter. Then leave the sutures and threads for about three or four days, then treat it.  If you wish, you can leave the wound without suturing and treat it with something that dries and contracts, for the eyelid will rise when the wound closes and heals; however, suturing is better.
This method of blepharoplasty was mentioned by the ancients, although it is burdensome for the patient; it is, however, a good procedure and without danger.  Another method of blepharoplasty is also to mark on the eyelid a shape like the shape of a laurel leaf, as we described. Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or grouped in this manner:.
Then cut off the excess eyelid with small scissors, evenly, in this manner:
If you cannot hold the hooks and they do not straighten out for you, then take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger canthus and a third thread near the smaller canthus.  Then gather the threads evenly between your fingers and raise them with a moderate lift.
Raise all of the marked skin as we described, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If a hot inflammation occurs at the time of your cutting or incision, then calm that inflammation with  kyrioti and similar soothing ointments.
It may also happen that the lower eyelid inverts its edges; then you should use what we mentioned of cutting, suturing, cauterization with fire, and with a caustic medicine. Cauterization with fire or with a caustic medicine is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and suturing; and cutting and suturing in both [upper and lower eyelids] is what you should do.
Cauterization with a reed is done in this manner: you invert the eyelid and make the incision we described on the inside; then make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length equal to the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
And you have trimmed their ends on both sides where the threads are fastened. Then gather them gently over the excess of the eyelid, and firmly tie the two reeds on both sides.  Leave it for several days; then the stretched skin will die, turn black, and fester.
Until it falls off by itself. If it is slow, cut it off with scissors, then treat it until it heals. When it has healed, the eyelid will be raised and the edges of the eyelid will not be inverted. This is the image of the two reeds which you make in this shape and this exact size in length and width:
Chapter Twelve.
On raising an ingrown eyelash from the eye with a needle.
If it is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a fine needle, thread it with a fine, smooth silk thread, then gather its ends and tie them in a very gentle knot, the length of the thread being about a span.
Then attach another fine thread to the needle, shorter than the first, and tie its ends if you wish. Then let the patient put his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the work may be clearly seen, for it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the ingrown hair.
And quickly pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out above the natural hair, then pull the thread upwards by the needle and draw into the needle that hair, whether it is one, two, or three, no more.
Then pull it with your hand until the hair comes out with the needle in the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you pull the needle and the hair does not come out with it, pull the needle downwards by the thread which you attached to it until the needle comes out from the upper opening.
Then return the hair into it and pull them both. Do this until it rises to the upper opening and you see it clearly. Then remove the needle and thread and take them out, and bandage the eye and leave it bandaged for two or three days until the hair settles in its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add a long hair from the natural hair to it so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer, then raise it.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of the stye which occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
That which this stye is exposed to is called a harelip, and this stye is either natural or accidental. The accidental one is from the healing of a wound or a cut or cauterization, and so on.
And the method of treatment is to incise that adhesion and separate its lips and place between them a linen wick and bind it until it heals.  And it is not advisable to use in its treatment things which dry and constrict.
For if you do that, the stye will return more severely than it was. Rather, use in it things which relax, such as fenugreek and lint with water in which marshmallow and flaxseed have been boiled, and diachylon ointment melted with something of the fats, and smear it on the wick and treat it with that.
And the key to its treatment is that you strive by every means that it not adhere in the way it was at first. And this treatment which we have mentioned is only some improvement of the stye, not that the appearance of the place returns to exactly as it was at all.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the treatment of the stye which occurs in the lower eyelid.
This stye which forms in the lower eyelid is that which is truly called a stye, and it is natural and it is accidental.  The accidental one is from a wound or incision or cauterization and the like.
And the method of working in it is that you take a needle with doubled thread and pierce it into the flesh and pass it from the left canthus to the right canthus until the thread is at the edges of the flesh, then you stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what is appropriate, otherwise you take a probe and place it at the site of the incision and turn the eyelid with it and make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the incisions are from the corners of the cut which you cut until they meet, and from them is formed an angle. Until, when they meet, its shape becomes similar to this shape:
And it is the Greek letter lambda, then you remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp side is lower than what is next to the eyelid, then you gather the scattered parts with two stitches, sewing it with a wool thread, then you treat it with what we mentioned of relaxing and astringent medicines until it heals.
And if the fistula has resulted from an incision, suture, or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision without the hair of the labia as well, as previously mentioned, then separate the lips with a probe as we mentioned.
In short, in the treatment of fistula, whether from above or below, you should act according to what is apparent to you of the form of the fistula, for it may differ greatly in appearance, and the skilled surgeon devises a solution in whatever way is possible for him.
Until the shape returns to its natural form or approximates it, and the disease itself indicates what treatment and instrument are suitable for it in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may occur to many people, such that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing its easy movement and hindering its natural functions; it is necessary to insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid.
And raise it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not sharp like cutting scalpels, but rather somewhat blunt, lest the patient be disturbed during the procedure and the scalpel slip, injuring the eye with its sharpness; and your cutting should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed, then pour into the eye salty water to wash it, or instill into it some solution of vitriol dissolved in water, then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen wick.
And place on top of the eye wool moistened with egg white, and after the third day use the astringent eye-salves until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cutting the pterygium and fleshy excrescences.
The pterygium is of two types: either nervous, resembling a firm, thin membrane, or non-nervous, resembling a hard white moisture; if touched by iron or attempted to be removed with a hook, it will be torn.
And a hook has not been fixed in it. Both types begin from the greater canthus and gradually extend until they cover the pupil and prevent light and movement of the eye. The procedure for cutting it is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then you grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and stretch it upwards, then you take a needle and insert into it a horsehair or oxhair and strong thread, and bend the end of the needle slightly and pierce it into the middle of the pterygium.
And you pass it through with the needle and tie the pterygium with the thread and stretch it upwards and dissect with the hair the side of the pterygium next to the pupil, as if you are spreading it with the hair to its end, then you cut the remainder at the root of the canthus with a fine scalpel or small scissors and leave the natural flesh of the canthus.
Lest there result from its cutting a constant flow of tears.  The pterygium may be stretched with the hook alone or with the thread as we said, then the smooth scalpel is used to dissect the end, whose image is this:
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, lest it cause a wound in it and the pupil is injured. Then, after cutting, put in the eye some powdered salt or vitriol, and leave it until the next day, then treat it as is appropriate until it heals.
If the pterygium is not fibrous and you cannot insert a needle into it or fix a hook in it, this type of pterygium is often treated with medicines and heals as described in the classification.  If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
And take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, in this image: And dissect the pterygium from above gently with it. If you see that it is loosening and fragmenting and the dissection has affected it, then instill in the eye from your container vitriol or red vitriol or powdered salt, and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless a hot inflammation interferes in the eye; then leave it and treat the hot inflammation until it heals, then resume the procedure of dissection until it heals. As for the fleshy outgrowth of the caruncle...
If the outgrowth harms the eye excessively, then hook that outgrowth with a hook and cut some of it, but do not overdo the cutting lest it cause a flow of tears, then instill in the canthi red vitriol or vitriol until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting the pterygium and what grows of excess flesh in the eye.
In the eyes of some people, a red, superimposed flesh may grow until it covers the pupil or approaches it or overflows onto the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids are inverted outwards and it resembles the rose of the pomegranate.
The procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap, then he opens his eyes, and you grasp all that red flesh with hooks suitable for that.
Or you grasp it with a rasp or forceps, then you cut the flesh, one piece at a time, until you remove it all by cutting, and you must be careful of the eye lest you injure it during the procedure. Your cutting may be done either with the scalpel that we described in cutting the pterygium, or with small scissors. Like those with which one plucks the hairs, as its image comes in the chapter following this chapter.
When you have finished cutting and all the growth is gone, fill the eye with finely ground salt or instill into it some red vitriol or similar caustic medicine, and apply externally to the eye a cotton pad with egg white to prevent hot inflammation.
If some of the growth remains and the bleeding overwhelms you and you fear hot inflammation, then leave the eye and treat it with things that calm inflammation, then return to working on it until it heals.  Do likewise with the excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any eye weak by nature or by circumstance with instruments of iron, and do not undertake any of these operations until you see that the organ can tolerate the procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
On removing pterygia from the eye.
Pterygia are red vessels that grow over the eye, hindering its function and weakening it over time.  First you should look; if the eye which has the pterygia is strong and has no other disease besides the pterygia,
then the removal is performed as follows: you should have the patient place his head in your lap, then you should hook those vessels with one or two hooks, according to your skill, and the hooks should be finely curved in this manner:.
Or they may be two hooks joined in one body, in this manner:
Then, with fine scissors, gently remove those vessels, wiping away the blood from time to time until you see that the vessels have been removed from the eye and the bleeding has stopped.  Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors, and let your work be done at midday facing the sun.
Be very careful in your work, so as not to cut anything besides those vessels. When you have finished, instill into the eye green or red vitriol to cauterize any remaining pterygium. If you cannot remove it all at that time, bandage the eye with something that will soothe its pain.
Leave it for some days until the pain subsides and the inflammation is safe, then repeat the operation in the same manner until it is cured. This is the image of the scissors.
Leave it [and let the patient's head be on the pupil's lap, and another wipes away the tears and adjusts the gaze at the front and back of the eye, and you] the principle in this operation is to open the eye with fixed or triangular speculums held by an assistant.
Sharp, and let the patient's head be on the pupil's lap, and another wipes away the tears and adjusts the gaze at the front and back of the eye, and you have the choice of beginning to remove it from the top of the eye or from the bottom. It is preferable to remove two strands at the upper side, one at the end of the corona and the other at its beginning.
Grasp it between the middle finger and the index finger, then hook the strands from below opposite them, then grasp it between the little finger and the ring finger, and lift your hand gently until you see that all the pterygium has risen; cut it from the smaller side if you wish with scissors, or if you wish with a fine scalpel.
And insert a thread on a needle and lift all the pterygium until it rises above the conjunctiva, and do not cut the strands, for tears and blood will obscure your view.
Then cut with scissors what extends beyond the cornea from above and below, so that nothing remains attached except to the cornea. If you can lift it from the cornea by pulling it with the thread, that is best, and this may be possible in some people.
And when you have cut it, cauterize its location for several days to alleviate pain and prevent inflammation, then resume treatment.
Chapter Nineteen.
On restoring a deviated nose.
Physicians call a deviated nose a polypus. If you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medication as previously described, and it does not heal, then there is no recourse except to incise the swelling when it is mature and to extract all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument of this shape:
The rasp, which is made of Indian iron, is called *khushnah*. Its head is round like a button, finely engraved with the pattern of a file or rasp. You place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then turn it between your fingers, applying slight pressure, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away.
Do this several times, then dress the wound with drying, astringent medications. If the wound closes and flesh grows over it, and the discharge stops, and it remains for forty days without recurring, suppurating, or developing any complications,
know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no recourse except to return the polypus to the nasal cavity in this manner:  Expose the bone again with an iron instrument or with a sharp medication. When the bone is exposed, take a probe of this shape:
The end of the iron instrument is triangular, and its shaft is conical, tapering towards the tip, as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the lacrimal duct, but slightly away from the eye. Then rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
He will feel air exiting from it if he holds his hand to his nose.  Then dress the wound with the drying astringent medications as I have taught you. If flesh grows and the area hardens, then the matter that was flowing outwards will return to the nose, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In returning a protrusion of the eye.
If the whole eye protrudes, and no damage or impairment occurs in the vision, then the patient should be relaxed, and then bled in the cephalic vein. Then apply a cupping glass to the nape of the neck without any stipulation, and gently suck.
Then apply a poultice made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and bdellium.  Then bind the eye over the poultice with many soft bandages.  The method for the bandages is to take many soft rags, folding each rag into four layers to make many of them.
Then place them one on top of another as much as the eye needs, then bind it firmly with a strong cloth. Repeat the cupping with suction without any stipulation, then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, it should be tightened gently. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, otherwise repeat the poultice, bandages, binding, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter twenty-one.
On the excision of the uvula.
If a hernia occurs in the uvular membrane, then it protrudes and appears outside the eyelids like a grape, and the appearance of the person is made ugly by it, and you wish to excise it, then the procedure is as I describe.
It is to insert a needle into the base of the uvula from below upwards, then insert another needle with doubled thread from the side of the uvula, and pass it through, leaving the first needle in place.
Then cut the doubled thread where it bends and tie some of the uvula around the needle with it and pull it firmly, then remove the needle and place moistened wool on the eye with egg white and leave it until the threads fall off with the uvula, then treat the eye with whatever strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  You may also tie the uvula from each side with a circle of cloth so that the eye is further drawn together firmly, then incise with a thin scalpel reaching to the depth of the eye, so that the whitish moisture flows, and the eye descends and shrinks in place, then pull it until it heals.
Chapter twenty-two.
In the treatment of the uvula.
This ailment called kimana is a swelling that gathers in the eye resembling descending water, though it is not. The method of treatment is that you seat the patient on a chair upright, then take his head in your hands from both sides.
And move it until you see the swelling descend to the lower part with your eye, then it settles and does not move, and the light departs, and the patient sees things as he used to see them. And if it does not descend to the lower part, we know that it is water. If the descent of the swelling is not achieved by what we have mentioned,
otherwise, seat the patient before you, then take a thin lancet and incise it slightly above the cornea at the point of contact of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the iris, until the matter comes out.
Then, when it has come out, instill in the eye warm water in which honey has been mixed, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have mentioned the types of water in the classification and which of them is suitable for cupping, in a detailed and explained statement, so take it from there correctly. Then it is necessary that you seat the patient before you, sitting squarely facing the light near the sun.
And you bind his healthy eye and bind it tightly, then you lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye in which the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the cupping instrument near the cornea, with the thickness of a probe, in the same white of the eye on the side of the smaller canthus, then you push the cupping instrument forcefully while turning it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the cupping instrument that it has reached something empty.
And it is necessary that the extent of the cupping instrument's penetration into the depth should be the distance that is from the pupil to the end of the black, which is the cornea; for the copper is seen in the same viewer's sight, clearly because of the clarity of the corneal membrane, then you move the cupping instrument upwards to the place in which the water is.
Then press it downwards repeatedly; if the water descends immediately, then the patient will see what his sight has been opened to immediately, and the cupping instrument is in his eye, then it rests a little; if the water rises, then lower it again without removing the cupping instrument.
Then if it settles and does not rise, remove the cupping instrument gently while you twist it with your hand little by little, then dissolve in the water a little clean Andarani salt and wash the eye with it from the inside, then place on the outside of the eye completely a compress or wet wool.
With rose oil and egg white, and bind it with the healthy eye; but as for us and the people of our time, we place on it crushed cumin with egg white. If the cupping instrument does not respond to entering the eye because of its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes, Then it is necessary that you take the scalpel which is called al-barīd, whose image is this:
Then pierce with it only the adherent part and do not exaggerate in the piercing; it is only that you should strike the cupping instrument a delicate place, then introduce the cupping instrument as we have mentioned.  And when your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm recumbent position in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room.
And he abstains from all movements and from coughing, and you make his food that which softens his constitution, and he does not move his head to the right or left at all, and the bandage remains in place until the third day, then you untie it in that dark room and test his sight.
And you show him things, then return the bandage until the seventh day. And it is not appropriate to do that during treatment or after cupping at your time, but it is necessary that you avoid that before the water ascends quickly with intense looking.
If a hot swelling appears, then it is necessary to untie the eye before the seventh [day] and treat that with what calms the swelling until, when it calms, then at that time you release his sight and place on his face a kerchief that trains his sight from under it for several days while he is in that dark room, then…
he leaves the house gradually and manages its causes. And know that the student in cupping cannot dispense with observation many times, then after that he proceeds to the work. And it has reached me from some Iraqis that he mentioned that he makes in Iraq a cupping instrument that is perforated, with which he draws out the water.
And I have not seen anyone in our country make that, nor read it in a book of the books of the ancients. And it is possible that this is something recent. And this is an image of types of cupping instruments for him who is ignorant of them to stand upon:
It is made of copper specifically, and its tip is with this same thinness, triangular-tipped, sharp.
Chapter twenty-four.
In the treatment of the flesh that grows in the nose.
There may grow in the nose various kinds of excessive flesh, of which there is something resembling a scorpion with many legs, and of which there is that which is cancerous flesh, hardened, dark in color, and of which there is that which is soft flesh, not dark in color.
As for that which of these fleshes is soft, not malignant nor cancerous, it should be that you seat the patient before you facing the sun, and open his nostril, and cast the snare into that flesh, then pull it outwards, then cut what you have grasped of it with a delicate, sharp scalpel from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone. If some remains that you could not cut, then remove it with one of the delicate instruments gently, until nothing of it remains. If the blood overcomes you or a hot swelling appears,
then counteract it with what is necessary. Or if it were of the malignant tumors, then hasten to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone. Then place in the nose after the cutting vinegar and water or a drink. If the nose opens and moisture passes from it to the throat,
know that he has healed. If the moisture does not pass as it should, then know that inside there is flesh growing on the top of the weakened bones that the instrument did not reach with the cutting. Then it should be that you take a thread of linen of some thickness.
and tie many knots in it, and make between each knot the space of a finger or less.  The patient should skillfully insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or with whatever he is able to after making it like a button, and pull his breath until it reaches the pharynx.
and it comes out at his throat. And often boys in school do this action, and it is a matter easy for whomever wants it. Then gather the two ends of the thread, the one end that came out at the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to saw the flesh, doing that until you know that the flesh has been cut by the knots of the thread. Then remove the thread and place in the nose, after wiping away the blood, a wick that has soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more.
until the ointment eats away all that remains of the flesh. Then, as a final thing, place a lead tube in the nose for some days until it heals. If it needs a drying treatment, use that.
And this is an image of the syringe with which ointments and medicines are dropped into the nose:
It is made of silver or copper, similar to a small, open oil lamp, and its passage is likewise.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the nozzle of the syringe flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when the ointment or whatever you wish of juices or flowing things is heated in it.
Chapter Twenty-five.
On warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Often a wart grows on the tip of the nose and increases and grows larger with the days until its appearance becomes ugly.
Therefore, it should be cut off at its first appearance and completely excised, then cauterize the area or apply a burning medication that takes the place of cautery. If cutting it off is missed until it grows large, then look: if it is hardened, solid, dark in color, and insensitive,
do not use an instrument on it, for it is a cancerous tumor, and I have often seen those who cut this tumor suffer great harm from it.  If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that it can be completely cut, empty the patient's bowels and cut it without hesitation or delay, and treat the area with what dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If their connection is separated by a wound or something similar, know that when a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, the treatment is rarely effective except in some people.
So if something like that happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with its blood, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures, and then treat it until it heals.  And if the separation of the connection has separated its edges and each part is whole, then you should scrape each part to the thickness of its outer skin until it bleeds.
Then bring the edges together with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle on them mastic and frankincense, powdered, and place over the sutures a plaster of palm-tree ointment or another of the adhesive ointments, and leave it bound for two or three days, then unbind it.
And change the medication and leave it until the threads separate by themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The method of suturing is to bring together the separated connection either with needles, as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread, as I have shown you there.
Chapter twenty-seven.
On removing the knots which appear in the lips.
Many people develop small, hard tumors inside their lips; some resemble a barleycorn, some are smaller, and some larger.  It is necessary to evert the lip and incise each nodule and suspend it with a hook.
And cut it from each side, then pack the area after cutting with powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the area with a styptic until the wounds heal.
Chapter twenty-eight.
On cutting away excess flesh in the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called apoulos. It should be hooked with a hook or grasped with forceps and cut at its base, and leave the moisture or blood to flow, then apply powdered alum to the area.
Or one of the astringent drying powders. If that flesh returns after treatment—for it often returns—cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On extracting teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly crusts may gather on the surfaces of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums.  They may blacken, yellow, and green, even causing damage to the gums and disfiguring the teeth.
Then you should seat the patient before you, his head in your lap, and clean the tooth or teeth in which you see the crusts and sandy substance until nothing remains.  You should do the same with the black, green, yellow, and other discolorations until you have cleaned them.
If the discoloration is removed at the first cleaning, well and good. Otherwise, repeat the cleaning on another day, and then again, until you achieve your goal. Know that different shaped and many forms of scrapers are needed for the teeth, depending on what suits your work.
Because the instrument used to scrape the inside of a tooth is different from that used to scrape the outside, and that used between the teeth is of yet another form.  These are several forms of scrapers that you should have prepared:
Chapter Thirty.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
You should treat the aching tooth by every means and delay its extraction, for there is no replacement for it once extracted, because it is a noble substance, except when its extraction is unavoidable.
If the patient is determined on its extraction, you should ascertain that it is the aching tooth. For often the patient is deceived by the pain and thinks that it is in the sound tooth, and extracts it, then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted.  We have seen this done repeatedly by barbers.
If you are certain which tooth is aching, then you should incise around the tooth with a moderately strong scalpel, so as to loosen the gum from all sides, then move it slightly with your fingers or with delicate forceps, little by little, until you loosen it.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps, and hold the patient's head between your knees, having steadied him so that he does not move; then pull the tooth straight out, so as not to break it. If it does not come out otherwise, take one of those instruments and carefully insert it under it from each side, gently rocking it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill the hole with a piece of cloth and pack it firmly with the end of a thin probe, lest it crumble when you pull it with the forceps; and you should make sure to thoroughly incise around the gum on every side.
And take care not to break it, for if some of it remains, it will cause the patient a greater affliction than his initial pain. And beware of doing what ignorant barbers do, in their haste and recklessness in extraction without using what we have described.
For they often inflict great harm on people, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and all or part of its roots remain. Or it may be extracted with part of the jawbone, as we have often witnessed. Then, after extraction, gargle with a drink or with vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the site—and this often happens—then crush some alum and pack it into the site.
Otherwise, cauterize it if the alum does not help. The image of the delicate forceps with which you initially move the tooth: they should have long ends, short handles, and be thick, lest they bend when you grasp the tooth with them. And this is the image of the large forceps:
They should be, as you see, thick in the handles, so that when you grasp them, they do not yield or bend; short in the ends; and made of Indian iron or of well-tempered steel, sharpened at the ends, and at the tip, teeth that interlock, so that they grasp firmly and tightly.
And the ends may be made in the shape of a file, which will also provide a strong grip.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On extracting the roots of molars and removing fractured jawbones.
If, when extracting a tooth, a root remains broken, you should apply a cotton pledget soaked in butter to the area for a day or two, until the area relaxes, then insert the forceps or hooks. whose ends resemble the beak of a bird called a *bulruja*.  And this is an image of the hooks:
They should be made like a file on the inside, or like a rasp. If you are unable to extract it with these hooks, you should excavate around the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert an instrument resembling a small lever, which is depicted thus:
short at the end, somewhat thick, and not pointed, lest it break. If the root is extracted by this means, well and good; otherwise, use these other instruments, which are depicted thus: the first has a triangular end and is somewhat thick.
Another fine triangular image:
And we may also use this instrument with two branches, which is also depicted thus:
and other instruments and tools previously mentioned in the extraction of teeth.  We may also use this instrument which resembles a large hook, which is depicted thus:
Triangular at the bent end, somewhat thick, lest it break; it should not be pointed.  Know that instruments for teeth are numerous, as are all other instruments; they are almost innumerable.  A skillful and clever craftsman may invent his own instruments according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate.
For there are diseases for which the ancients did not mention instruments, because of the diversity of their types. If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is fractured or becomes rotten, then investigate its location with one of these instruments and hooks mentioned for the extraction of roots.
And we use a forceps, its image is this:
It should be somewhat thick to grasp the bone so that it does not slip until the bone is removed.  We treat the area with appropriate medicines. If the bone has slight decay, scrape away its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two
On the extraction of molars growing on top of others.
If molars grow in a place other than their natural position, their appearance is marred, especially if this happens in women and slaves.  It should be examined; if the molar has grown behind another tooth...
and its extraction or pushing back is not possible, then extract it. If it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument, whose image is this:
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian iron.  Cut it in several sessions because of the tooth’s hardness, lest you disturb other teeth. But if it is firmly rooted, file it down with an Indian file, whose image is this.
It should be entirely of Indian [steel], its cutting edge very fine, like the file used to make needles. File the tooth little by little over many days gently, lest you loosen the tooth and it falls out. Then file it again and remove it with some forceps.
If a tooth is broken and hurts the tongue when speaking, it should also be filed down until the roughness of the fracture is gone, it is even, and smooth, so it does not hurt the tongue or impair speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On binding loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loose and mobile from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything to eat for fear they will fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines but the treatment has not worked.
The solution is to tie them with a gold or silver thread; gold is better because silver tarnishes and rots after a few days, while gold remains unchanged forever and is not subject to that. The thread should be of a medium thickness, appropriate for the space between the teeth.
The method of binding is to take the thread and insert its loop between the healthy teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach a healthy tooth on the other side by weaving.
Then weave back to the side where you began, and pull gently and carefully so that they do not move at all.  Tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose. Then cut off the excess thread with scissors, gather it together, twist it, and hide it between the healthy and loose tooth.
So that it does not injure the tongue. Then leave it tied as long as it remains. If it becomes loose or breaks, tie it with another thread.  In this way, he will enjoy it for his whole life. This is an image of the teeth and how to bind them, showing two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
It may be that a single tooth or two, after falling out, can be returned to its place and bound as we described, and it will remain. This is done by a skillful dentist.  He may carve a bone from cattle and shape it like a tooth, and place it in the place from which the tooth has fallen. And it is tightened as we said, and it remains, and he enjoys it.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
Concerning the cutting of the ligament which appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament which appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound which has healed.
And the procedure is that you open the mouth of the patient and place his head in your lap and raise his tongue, then cut that ligament transversely until the tongue is released from its restraint. If there is some stiffness and complexity, and this is from the healing of a wound, then place a hook in it and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knot is loosened.
And beware that the incision be not deep into the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding results. Then let him rinse the mouth after the cutting with rose water or with vinegar and cold water, then place under the tongue a pledget of lint which the patient holds in place each night.
Lest it unite again.  If bleeding occurs, place powdered alum on the place. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the place with a lentil-shaped cautery suitable for this. Then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On removing a frog which has formed under the tongue.
A swelling resembling a small frog may occur under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and it may even grow large enough to fill the mouth. The treatment is to open the patient's mouth towards the sun and look at the swelling.
If you see it dark colored or black, hard and insensitive to the patient, do not interfere with it, for it is a cancer. But if it is whitish and moist, insert a hook into it and dissect it with a fine scalpel, freeing it from every side.
If bleeding overwhelms you during the operation, apply powdered vitriol until the bleeding stops, then resume your work until you remove it completely. Then let the patient rinse the mouth with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with other suitable remedies until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
In the treatment of tonsil tumors.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors, glands may appear inside the throat resembling those that appear outside, called tonsils. If you treat them with what I mentioned in the section and they do not heal,
then look: if the tumor is hard, dark in color, and insensitive, do not approach it with an instrument; and if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not approach it with an instrument either, for fear of hemorrhage, but leave it until it matures, then either lance it or it will burst of its own accord.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut.  The procedure is that you should look before operating whether its hot inflammation has completely subsided, or lessened somewhat.
Then seat the patient facing the sun, with his head in your lap, and open his mouth; and take an assistant with you who will press his tongue downward with an instrument of this form:
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife.  When you press the tongue down with it and the tumor is visible and you see it, take a hook and pierce it into the tonsil and pull it outward as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes with it.
Then cut it with an instrument of this form, resembling scissors except that its two ends are curved, each one next to the other, very sharp; it is made of Indian iron or Damascene steel:
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel of this form:
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After you cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same way. Then, after cutting, gargle the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peel or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops, then treat him until he is healed. Other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils; cut them as described for cutting the tonsils.
I treated a woman who had a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a polyp, somewhat insensitive, which almost blocked the throat. The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and was prevented from eating and drinking water.
She was on the verge of death if she remained for a day or two.  Two branches extended from the tumor, even emerging from her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserted a hook into one of them and pulled; a suitable piece was extracted.
Then I cut it where I reached it through the nostril. Then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril.  Then I opened her mouth, depressed her tongue, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut some of it; only a little blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately began to drink water and then eat.  We continued to cut away portions of the tumor repeatedly over a long time, the tumor replacing what was cut, until it lasted a long time for both of us.
Then I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside the throat.  It stopped growing, and she traveled away; I do not know what God did with her afterward.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On cutting a tumor of the uvula.
That which is called ‘an-‘unabah’ if it descends as a growth onto the uvula and swells, and is white and oblong, it is called ‘amood’; and if it is thicker at the bottom and round, it is called ‘an-‘unabah’. If it is treated as mentioned in the classification and the treatment is not effective…
And I saw that the hot tumor had subsided from her, and it was thin; so it should be cut, and whatever part of it was clustered and round, and did not have length, and was bloody or the color of pus, or black, or insensitive, then it should be avoided cutting.
For in it there is danger to the patient. So if you see it in the manner I described, of its whiteness and length, then you should seat the patient next to the sun and compress his tongue with the instrument whose description I presented earlier, then pierce the uvula with the hook.
And pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in cutting the tonsils. And it is necessary that you not cut from it except that which exceeds the natural state, without excess, because if you cut more from it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after cutting, use what we described in cutting the tonsils, and treat it until it heals. If the patient is afraid of cutting it, then it is necessary to use a method in cauterizing it without fear or caution. The method of cauterization in it is only with a sharp medicine, and that is that you place the patient’s head in your lap.
Then compress his tongue with the instrument we mentioned, then take from the sharp water which I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with unquenched lime, and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument with it. And this is its image:
Its tip, in which you place the medicine, has a concavity like the concavity of a spoon, and you place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, and the patient lying on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat, lest something descend from it into his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine while you press it on the uvula for about half an hour until you see that it has blackened and the sting of the medicine has subsided. And if you wish, take cotton, wrap it around the end of a probe, and moisten the cotton in the medicine.
And insert the probe with the cotton into the tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the uvula, then leave it. It will wither and fall after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it.
After cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter and wipe away the medicine around it. Then gargle with cold water and treat from the outside with ointments and from the inside with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and further from fear.
The uvula may also be treated with something gentler than cauterization and cutting; it is treated with fumigation in this manner:  Take fumitory, hyssop, thyme, rue, wormwood, chamomile, and costmary, and similar herbs. Gather them all, or some of them, in a pot and submerge them in vinegar.
Boil it, the pot being plastered with medicinal clay, and there should be a hole in the middle of the lid onto which a hollow instrument is fitted, made in this manner, of silver or copper:
Insert the end with the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is well steamed. Then repeat this several times until it withers. And beware of performing this treatment at the first onset of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling.  Rather, it should be done when its hot swelling subsides. If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit a piece of eggshell to its end so that the patient's mouth is not burned.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth, and this is among the good treatments and is safe.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On removing thorns and similar things that lodge in the throat.
Often a fish bone or thorn or something similar lodges in the throat.  What is visible should be removed with the eye, after the tongue has been pressed down with an instrument, near the uvula.
So that you may see what is in the throat.  And if it does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, then the patient should vomit before his food is digested in his stomach, for perhaps the lodged thing will come out with the vomit. Or the patient should swallow a piece of turnip or a head of lettuce.
Or he should swallow a mouthful of dry bread, or you may take a piece of soft sea sponge and tie it to a string, then he should swallow it. When it reaches the place of the thorn, pull the string quickly; do this several times.
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out. If it does not come out by the methods mentioned, then use a lead instrument of this shape:
It should be slightly thicker than a probe, and at its end a hook. The patient inserts it gently into his throat, raising his head upwards and being careful not to touch his windpipe, lest he cough and thereby push the bone or thorn further in. Or the physician may insert it with his hand.
And it is better for the patient to insert it himself, because he knows the location of the lodged object, and he pushes it downwards or pulls it upwards with the instrument, all this as much as he is able, until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If you treat the leech with what we mentioned in the section on medicinal treatment and it is ineffective, then look into the patient's throat in the sunlight after you have pressed down his tongue with the instrument I described to you.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a fine, tightly woven swab.  If you cannot do this, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert a hot iron into the tube's cavity.
Do this repeatedly, and the patient should abstain from water for the whole day. Then he should take a jug full of cold water, open his mouth into it, and rinse his mouth with it, without swallowing a drop, moving the water around from time to time with his hand.
The leech will fall out when it senses the water. If it does not come out as described, fumigate the throat with urine and with asafoetida using the instrument described for fumigating the tonsils; do this repeatedly, for it will fall out.
The procedure for fumigation is as follows: take a pot containing hot coals, the pot being covered with a lid having a hole in its middle.  Fit the end of the instrument into this hole, then add the fumigant. The patient places his mouth over the end of the tube and closes his mouth so that the fumigant does not escape, until he knows that the fumigant has reached his throat.
Then the leech will fall out. If it does not, repeat the fumigation.  The patient should endure thirst, eat salty things and garlic, and not drink water; the leech must come out with this treatment. This is an image of an instrument for extracting the leech from the throat when it is visible.
It resembles hooks, as you see, except that it has this curve which enters the throat, and its ends resemble a bird's beak; they are rough like a file, so that when they grasp something, they do not let go.
And another instrument, with which the tongue is compressed; it is a wide iron ring, large enough to fit in the mouth over the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, so that the mouth remains open without the patient's will, and he is completely unable to remove it until it is taken away.
The description of the instrument with which the mouth is opened in this same way.
Chapter Forty.
It will deal with the cauterization and incision of tumors.
Tumors are numerous and varied in kind, as will be described one by one in this book.  They differ in their cauterization and incision in two respects: one, from the type of tumor itself and what it contains of humors.
The second type is due to the locations in the body where they occur, for a tumor occurring in the head is not the same as a tumor occurring in the anus, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy location is not the same as a tumor occurring in a joint; each has its own rule of treatment.
Some tumors should not be cauterized except after the pus in them has matured and is complete, while others should be cauterized while they are raw and have not fully matured, such as tumors that are near the joints.
For if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition persists until it corrupts what is around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, thus causing the crippling of that limb; or the tumor may be near a principal organ.
Because if you delay its cauterization until it matures, you will harm that principal organ; or it may be near the anus, so cauterize it raw.  It is necessary to cauterize a raw, not fully mature tumor that is near the anus, lest it become putrid and penetrate into the interior of the anus, becoming a fistula.
And it becomes to a point where it does not heal. You should know the time for cauterizing tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever is gone, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and all other signs [of maturity] appear.
And you should apply the cautery to the lowest possible part of the tumor, if that is possible, so that the flow [of pus] is easier downwards; or in the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor.  The cautery should be applied lengthwise along the limb if the tumors are in the hands or feet.
And the places of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries; in short, in all smooth places that do not bend. As for those that bend, the cautery should be applied according to that location.  If the tumor is in fleshy places, it is best to leave it uncauterized.
Until its maturation is complete, as we have said, for if you cauterize it before that, the discharge of pus will be prolonged, it will be very harmful and dirty, and perhaps its lips and base will harden. Some tumors may be cauterized across the body, when necessary, or according to what the member requires.
You should use one cautery for small tumors, and for large tumors a wide cautery or many incisions, according to the size of the tumor.  There may be tumors where it is necessary to scrape away the skin and cut it if it has become like a rag.
And it has reached the point where what has died is like what occurs in many abscesses and hidden collections. Some of them are incised with a three-cornered incision, and some are cut like an ivy leaf, like the inguinal tumor.
Some use a circular incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions.  If it does not have a head, like smooth, flat tumors, then it should only be cauterized simply. If the tumor is large and has been present for a long time and you cauterize it, you should not rush to remove all the pus at that time.
Rather, remove some of it, then dress the tumor until another day, then remove some more of the pus; do this repeatedly gradually until you remove all of it.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man, for the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden exit of pus, so the patient may die and you do not notice, so be very careful in this matter.
After cauterizing these tumors, you should wipe the wound and look at it. If the wound of the tumor is small or the incision is single and simple, use lint or old cotton for packing. If the tumor is large and the cauterization incisions are numerous,
then you should insert a wick into each incision until some of them reach each other.  And if some of the skin of the tumor has been cut or scraped away, then you should pack it with old cotton or linen lint without moisture and dress it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs while you are working, use cold water and vinegar, after soaking a linen cloth in them, and apply it to the bleeding site repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the measures, treatments, and styptics that we have described in many places in this book and in the division. If it is winter and the location of the tumor is very sensitive, you should moisten the pledgets with a warm potion and oil.
And place them on the site. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply pledgets soaked in water and oil or in a potion and oil, all of it cold, until the third day, as we said. Then you should remove the dressing from the tumor and wipe it.
And use similar treatments until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the detailed method, I have described how to treat each tumor in a summarized, categorized manner.
Chapter forty-one.
Concerning incisions on tumors that appear on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp; they are a type of boil contained within sacs, similar in appearance to a chicken’s pouch.  There are many types; some are fatty, and some contain a moisture resembling pus.
Some contain a moisture resembling whey and broth, and so on. Some are hard and calcified.  There is no danger in incising and removing all of them, unless you encounter an artery during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument, the image of which follows, called the “muddass”, so that you know what it contains. If its contents are fluid, incise it lengthwise with a simple incision, in this manner:
Begin the incision from point B to point C. When the fluid has been evacuated, remove the sac that contained the fluid and cut it away completely, leaving nothing at all, for it often recurs if any part remains.
Then dip a cotton swab in yellow ointment, if available; otherwise, in salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it until the next day, for it will consume what remains of the sac. Then reapply the cotton swab with the yellow ointment a second and third time, if necessary.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the swelling contains fatty material, incise it in this manner:
Make a firm incision, and place hooks in the edges of the wound, and strip it from all sides.  Do your best to remove the membrane containing it. If an artery obstructs you, do as I have described to you. Do likewise in the swelling if it is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as I have described.  The incision on a hardened swelling is easier because it contains little blood and fluid. Some of these swellings in the head in some people contain no fluid at all. For I incised a swelling in...
the head of an old woman, and I found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone, impossible to break; if someone threw it, it would wound him.  It was unlike other swellings occurring in the head, except for those appearing in the heads of children.
And at the roots of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision, and make their base from below, so that the material may easily flow downwards.  Then treat them with what suits them of treatment.
Chapter Forty-two.
Concerning the incision on the swellings which frequently appear in the neck. These swellings frequently appear in the neck and under the armpits and in the groins; they may appear in the rest of the body. That which appears in the neck may be single, or it may be multiple, and some develop from others.
And each swelling of them is within a special membrane, as is the case with the boils and the swellings of the head as we have described. And the types of these swellings are many; some are hardened, some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
So I saw one of them which was good in condition to the touch, and its appearance was close to the color of the skin; it moved in every direction and was not attached to a nerve of the neck, nor to a vein, nor to an artery, nor was it deep-seated. Then it should be incised with a simple incision from the top to the bottom of the body in this manner, from line J to line B.
And peel it from every side, and stretch the lips of the skin with a hook or with two hooks or with many hooks, if that is needed, as we said in the case of the swellings of the head; and remove it little by little, and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve, and let the scalpel not be very sharp.
Lest your hand increase the cutting, or the patient be troubled, and you cut what you do not need to cut.  If you cut a vein or an artery and it hinders your work, then place in the wound powdered verdigris or some of the styptics which stop blood.
And tighten the wound and leave it until the acuteness of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to suppurate, for the bleeding will then stop; then return to your work until you finish.  Then examine with your index finger if there remain any other small tumors; then cut them and cleanse them.
If there is a large vein at the root of the tumor, then it should not be cut from its root, but it should be tied with a doubled tight thread and left until it falls off by itself without harm; then stuff the wound with old cotton which has been dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the whole tumor, then it is necessary to bring together the lips of the wound and stitch it immediately after you know that no residue remains at all. If you see that there remains a residue of the bone of the tumor.
Then it is necessary that you aim with the cutting at its origin and base, and use the stitching and what we have mentioned. And as for the tumors containing fluids, apply a simple cautery where the place of their ripening appears to you, and make the cautery from the lower side as we said.
Then after cauterization, use a dressing with Egyptian ointment and the like to consume what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound has been cleansed, then treat it with ointments that grow flesh until it heals.
Chapter forty-three.
Concerning the incision of the throat for a tumor that occurs inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is the account of their words. As for those with angina, they should avoid the incision of the throat, for they will not benefit from it.
Because all the veins and the lung will be weak, but those with a hot tumor in the mouth or throat or tonsils, if there is no illness in the trachea, then it is necessary to use an incision of the throat to escape the harm that results from suffocation.
If we intend to do this, then we should incise the throat below three or four rings of the trachea, a small transverse incision between two rings, to the extent of the incision in the peritoneum, not in the cartilage. This location is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant. If the physician is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until he reaches the trachea, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should incise the peritoneum which we have described.  The incision of the trachea is indicated by the phlegm that exits from it, along with what is excised, and by the cessation of the voice. The wound is left open for a time, and when the time that the suffocation was feared has passed, the edges of the wound are brought together from the skin.
And its incision alone, without the cartilage, then use medicines that cause the flesh to grow until it heals. The author of this book said: The explanation of all this which we have narrated is only if they see that the patient's throat is obstructed by one of these tumors that were mentioned.
And the patient is close to death, and his life is about to end, they proceed to incise the throat so that the patient breathes through the wound, and is saved from death.  They were ordered to leave the wound open until the severity of the illness subsides, and its severity is about three days or so.
Then they are ordered to suture the wound and treat it until it heals. What I witnessed myself is that a maidservant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, cutting some of the windpipe. I was called to treat her, and I found her weakening like one who is slaughtered.  So I uncovered the wound.
Then I found the blood that came from the wound to be little, so I knew that she had not cut a vein nor a jugular vein, and the air was exiting from the wound.  I proceeded, incised the wound, and treated it until it healed. Nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice, and no more.
And after days she returned to her best condition.  From this we say that incising the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter forty-four.
Concerning the incision on the tumor which appears in the throat from the outside and is called the throat’s elephantiasis.
This tumor which is called the throat’s elephantiasis is a large tumor, the color of the body. It is frequent in women and is of two types.
Either it is natural or accidental. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it; as for the accidental, it is of two kinds: one resembling fatty swellings, and the other resembling the tumor which results from the obstruction of an artery, and its incision is dangerous. Therefore, one should not at all use the iron on it, except what is small of it; if you probe and examine it with a probe and find it resembles a fatty swelling and is not connected to anything of the veins, then incise it as you incise fatty swellings. And remove it with its containing sac, if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove it all completely, then treat the place with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter forty-five.
Concerning the incision of various swellings.
Swellings are of many types, and I have mentioned all their types in the classification. It is necessary to explain here the difference between a swelling and an abscess, since it is difficult. I say that with an abscess there is heat, fever, and frightening pain until the boiling of the matter subsides. And the putrefaction is completed, then the fever and intensity subside.  A swelling is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain, and it is contained within a membranous sac, which is its special covering. It is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a lentil, and it becomes like a blister, larger or smaller.
And it is of two types: either fatty, or it contains moisture. The colors of the moisture are many, as I have mentioned in the classification. Therefore, when you come to treat a swelling, you should first probe and examine it with the instrument called the probe, whose image will come in the chapter after this.
Assess the size of the swelling, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If fluid of any color comes out, then incise it with a simple incision, as I have mentioned in the case of other swellings. If no fluid comes out after the probe, then know that it is fatty.
Then make a firm incision on it in this manner, as I have taught you, and attach it with hooks. Carefully peel the skin from every side, and preserve the sac, if you are able, so that you may remove it whole with the swelling.
If the sac is ruptured during the procedure and you are unable to remove it whole—and this often happens—then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. For if any part of it remains, however small or large, the swelling will return in most cases.
If it overcomes you and a little remains, cauterize the wound at its completion with some sharp cauterizing instruments.  Tighten the wound and place on top of it something that soothes hot swelling and treat it with other treatments until it heals. If the swelling is large, suture its lips and treat it with that which heals.
If you encounter a superficial or deep vein and bleeding occurs, quickly cauterize the area with powdered vitriol and leave it bound for two or three days until the wound becomes infected and the flow of blood stops. Then return to removing what remains of the swelling.
Chapter forty-six.
On the forms of instruments.
Those which are used in incision and cauterization; among them are the forms of probes, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are made of iron or steel, square-ended and tightly made, to facilitate entry into tumors. These are the images of probes, and they are called *bard*.  They are also of three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are suitable for exploring tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities for what is inside them of bone and the like. They are made round, polished, and smooth like stylets, of Chinese copper, or of *ispadruwiyya*, or of copper, or of iron, or of silver; and the best of them are those made of *ispadruwiyya*.
Probes may also be made of black lead.  They are suitable for probing fistulas which have a curve in their depth, so that they flex gently with that curve.  They are also of three types, for there are long ones, medium ones, and short ones.
According to the need of the depth of each fistula, and its thickness is made according to the width and narrowness of the fistula. Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks.  They are numerous types, for there are simple ones, that is, those with one hook, and these are of three types: large, medium, and small.  And there are blind hooks, and these are of three types. And there are hooks with two hooks, and these are of three types. And there are curved hooks with two hooks. And these are of three types. And there are hooks with three hooks, and these are of three types. And all these types, each one is needed in its place. Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.

And these are images of the scalpels with which one incises and excises ulcers and tumors.  They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its edges, with which it incises, are sharpened, and the other ends are not sharpened.  Rather, they are made thus so that one may use them in excising the ulcer when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may be somewhat comfortable and find a little relief from the burning he feels when the tumor is excised.
And these are images of the probes. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large probe.
It is made of copper, similar to the probe with which one applies kohl, and at one end is something like a wide spoon of two layers, which has in its head a hidden blade resembling the tongue of a bird that moves in and out as desired, as you see.
Images of the scalpels which are inserted between the fingers when cutting tumors, so that the patient does not feel them.  They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Images of the cupping instruments with which blood is drawn. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of the large cupping instrument.
They are made of copper or china, slightly elongated as you see, and thin.  These types of cupping instruments should be at hand, large and small, to quickly draw blood when necessary, and when medicine is not available.
But they are not used to draw blood from every part of the body, but rather from fleshy areas such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the muscles of the arm, the breast, the abdomen, the groin, and similar moist fleshy parts.
And other small instruments may be made from them, resembling pistachio shells, in this manner:
Blood is drawn with them if it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or when a vein or artery is cut.  They may also be made round in this manner:
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On the treatment of men's breasts.
The breasts of some people may swell at the age of puberty until they resemble women's breasts, remaining swollen and unsightly. If this is disliked, then it is necessary to incise the breast with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner.
From line B to line C. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with a cauterizing medicine, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals.  If the breast inclines downwards and becomes flaccid due to its size, as happens with women,
it is necessary to make two crescent-shaped incisions in its upper sides, each joining the other at their ends so that the larger line encircles the smaller one, in this manner: From line B to line C, then remove the skin between the incisions and remove the fat, and use what we mentioned of sutures and dressings and whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If you cannot remove all that needs to be removed because of the patient's anxiety or because of bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it eats away the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter forty-eight.
On the treatment of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are a kind of hard, cystic swellings, and some contain fluids.  Those that contain fluids should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner.
From line B to line C.  If all the fluid in the tumor is evacuated, pack it with old cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with a suitable ointment until it heals. If the tumor is a kind of nodular swelling, incise it as we mentioned in the incision of swellings. If the wound progresses to the point where pus forms, cauterize it as we previously mentioned.
Chapter forty-nine.
On the incision of a tumor that appears near an artery or vein, called anorisma.
If an artery is injured and the skin over it heals, a tumor often results from this; similarly, a vein may also develop a swelling and tumor.
The signs by which one knows whether the tumor and swelling are from an artery or from a vein are: if the tumor is from an artery, it is oblong and deep-seated in the body; and if you press the tumor with your finger, you feel as if it has a whirring sound.
That which is from a vein, the tumor is round on the surface of the body, and incision of these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many other places of the body where they are very large; therefore, one should avoid treating them with iron.
And those that are also in the extremities or in the head should be avoided.  As for those that are a swelling of the mouth of an artery, incise it in the skin with a longitudinal incision, then open the incision with hooks, then peel away the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle under it and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I have taught you in the ligation of the two arteries in the temples; then incise with a scalpel the area between the ligatures until all the blood in it comes out.
Then the tumor will resolve, and then use treatment that produces pus until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the tumor is from a severed vein, you should grasp with your hand as much of the tumor as possible together with the skin, then insert a needle below the place you grasped with your hand and pass it through with a doubled thread until you bring it out on the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly with it, according to what I have described to you in tying the uvula from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads will slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire tumor at the intersection of the first needle.
And tighten your threads in four places, then incise the tumor in its middle until what is in it comes out, then cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied, then apply a dressing that you have soaked in a potion and oil. Then use treatment with cauterization and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor that occurs from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as a tumor occurs in an artery and vein, so too does a tumor occur in a nerve if a blow occurs in it or it occurs from excessive fatigue or the like.  This is most common in the wrists and heels.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a soft tumor, its color resembling the rest of the body. It is, in most cases, painless.  If pressed hard, the patient feels something like numbness. The tumor is not concentrated deep in the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in every direction, but not forward or backward. As for those that are in the joints, they should not be approached with iron, for it may cause gangrene. As for those that are in the head or forehead,
Incise the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from the root. If it is large, hang it with a hook and flay it, then remove it, and close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On the excision of warts which appear in the abdomen.
Many people develop warts on their abdomens and other parts of their bodies; these are called fungal warts because of their resemblance to mushrooms. Their base is thin and their head is thick, their edges sometimes turn inwards; some are small and some grow very large.
I once saw a man who had two warts on his abdomen; they resembled mushrooms, white and thin at the base, their edges turned inwards and cracked, and moisture constantly flowed from them. I cut them off; one weighed about eighteen ounces, and the other about six.
In cutting them, you should observe that if the patient is moist and the wart is white, moist, and thin at the base, cut it with a wide scalpel, and have cautery irons ready in the fire, for often much blood flows when they are cut.
If the bleeding is excessive, cauterize it immediately. If you find the patient cowardly and afraid of cutting with an iron, take a strong lead thread and tie it tightly around the wart of this kind, and leave it for two days, then increase the tightness of the lead, continuing to tighten it.
Tighten it repeatedly until it affects the wart, so that it is severed and falls off by itself without effort. If the wart has a thick base, there is some danger and uncertainty in cutting it, especially if it is in the abdomen; however, it is possible to cut off half of it or some of it.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, and then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of cutting a wart that is dark in color, insensitive, and foul-looking, for it is a cancerous tumor, and we shall discuss cancer later.
Chapter fifty-two.
In the treatment of umbilical hernia.
An umbilical hernia may result from many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum of the abdomen, from which fat or intestine protrudes, as occurs in other hernias; or from blood emitted from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from wind that is contained within it.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of fat, then the color of the swelling will resemble that of the body, it will be soft without pain, and it will appear in various positions. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, its position will be more variable than what we have described.  If you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns, and there may be gurgling. It increases greatly upon entering a bath and with severe exertion. If it is due to moisture, then it will be soft.
It will not disappear if you press it with your hand, nor will it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, then along with these signs, the swelling will appear dark. If it is due to growing flesh, the swelling will be firm, hard, and remain at a constant size.
If it is due to wind, it will be soft to the touch. The procedure in this case is that you should observe: if the umbilical hernia is due to blood from an artery or vein or to wind, then you should refrain from treating it, for there is danger and deception in that, as I have informed you in the chapter where I mentioned the swellings that occur from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical hernia is due to the intestine or fat, then you should instruct the patient to restrain himself and stand upright and extended, then you should draw a line with ink around the entire umbilicus. Then you should order him to lie on his back before you. Then you should incise with a wide scalpel around the umbilicus at the place marked with ink. Then you extend the center of the swelling upwards with a large probe, and then you tie the incised area with a strong thread or silk string, tightly.
The knot of the ligature should be a slip-knot. Then open the center of the constricted swelling above the ligature and insert your index finger. Search for the intestine; if you find that the ligature has seized it, loosen the slip-knot and push the intestine into the abdomen. If you find fat, extend it with a probe.
And cut away its excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, ligate it carefully and return to your work. Take two needles and thread them with strong threads, and insert the needles into the incision that you made around the swelling, crosswise, passing them through. Then tighten the swelling in four places on the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the constricted flesh decays and falls off by itself, or cut it if it softens and decays. Then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical hernia is from flesh that has grown there,
or from moisture, then it is necessary to incise the swelling as we said and evacuate the blood or moisture that you find in it, then treat it with what will close the wound.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medications and the warning against treating it with iron lest it ulcerates, and we have mentioned the cancer that develops in the uterus and the warning against treating it.
And the ancients mentioned that when the cancer is in a place that can be completely excised, like the cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar easily removed parts, especially if it is small and incipient, but if it has progressed and become large, then it should not be approached.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that, and the procedure, if it is possible as we said, is to first purge the patient with black hellebore several times, then bleed him if there is clear fullness in the veins.
Then you position the patient in a position that allows you to work, then you apply to the cancer the appropriate hooks, then you scrape it from every side along with the skin completely until nothing of its roots remains, and you leave the blood to flow and do not stop it quickly.
Rather, squeeze the areas and draw out all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can, and if you encounter in the procedure profuse bleeding from a severed artery or vein, then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter fifty-four.
On the treatment of fistula.
We have already described in the classification the types of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, and the signs of each type and its treatment with medication.  That which is treated with cautery is only the ascitic type alone, and the tympanitic type and the fleshy type are not at all approached with cautery.
For that is fatal, if you have treated this type of ascitic fistula with medications and your treatment has not been effective, then look, for if the patient is extremely weak, or if he has another illness besides the fistula, such as...
cough or diarrhea and the like, then beware of treating him with cautery, for that is perilous. But if you see that the patient is strong, without illness other than the fistula alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the procedure is to have the patient stand before you. and an attendant behind him to press his belly with his hands and push the water downwards towards the pubis, then take a lancet in this manner:
pointed at both ends, long, with a sharp point like a lancet, except that it has a slight curve so that it does not go beyond the intestine during the procedure and injure it. Then look, if the fistula originates from the intestines.
Then it is necessary to make the incision three fingers' breadth below the navel, directly above the pubis. If the fistula originated from a liver disease, let your incision be three fingers' breadth to the left of the navel; if it originated from a spleen disease, let the incision be three fingers' breadth on the right side.
Also, the incision should not be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie down, lest the fluids flow to that weak place. Then pierce the whole skin with the instrument, then insert the instrument into the incision and raise your hand.
with the lancet between the skin and the peritoneum, as if you are flaying it, and the amount you flay should be about the size of a fingernail or so. Then pierce the peritoneum until the lancet reaches an empty place, which is the location of the water, then remove it and insert into the hole the instrument which is of this form.
It is like a small tube made of silver, or copper, or smooth, polished lead.  It has a small hole at its lower end and three holes in its sides; two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And one may sharpen its end in the shape of a pen nib, as in this image:.
At its upper end is a ring.  If the instrument reaches the water, then it will immediately flow down the instrument and you will evacuate a moderate amount of water at a time. For if you evacuate more than is necessary at one time, the patient may die from the dissipation of his vital spirit.
Or he may experience a faintness close to death. But evacuate according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates to you of the strength of his pulse and the good color of his complexion. Then remove the instrument and the water will be contained, for it will be contained immediately.
Because of the skin that holds the hole in the peritoneum, which I told you to suture in that manner. Then return the instrument another day if you see that the patient can tolerate it.
And you will also remove a small amount of water.  Do this for several days, while you are watchful and cautious against error, until only a small amount of water remains. If you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, then treat him by burying him in hot sand.
And profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and enduring thirst, and treat him with drying medicines until he recovers.  And cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as I described previously.
Chapter Fifty-five.
In the treatment of children who are born with their urinary passages unperforated, or with a narrow perforation, or with the perforation in the wrong place.
Some boys may be born with their urethra imperforate; it is necessary to perforate it immediately upon birth.
With a very fine scalpel, in this manner:
Then place a thin lead nail in the perforation, and bind it and keep it in place for three or four days. When he wants to urinate, remove it, and afterwards replace it.  If you do not use the lead, it is possible that the urine passing through the place will not allow it to close.
As for him whose perforation is narrow, treat it with lead as we have said for many days until it widens.  And those whose perforation is in the wrong place—that is, some are born with the perforation at the end of the penis and are unable to urinate forward.
so that he lifts the urethra upwards by hand, and is not born before because the semen is unable to reach the uterus in a straight line, and this is a very ugly condition. The method of treatment in this case is that the patient lies on his back.
Then extend his penis with your left hand with a strong pull, and incise the glans penis with a sharp blade or scalpel, like a pen-knife, or as if you are carving something so that its middle is prominent, like a penis, and the perforation is in the middle as it should be.
And be careful during your work not to cause bleeding, for that often happens; so stop the bleeding with what cuts it off, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter fifty-six.
On the ulcer that appears in the foreskin and penis, and its blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This ulcer often appears in the urethra; it is a fleshy, rough growth, and there is benign and malignant.  The benign one should be tied off with a fine ligature.
And cut it until you remove it all, then apply a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterwards with date-palm ointment until it heals. But if the ulcer is malignant and dark in color, you should cauterize it after cutting and removing it.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and part outside, then you should remove the ulcer inside first, until it heals, then treat the outside.
Because if you treat both together, you risk perforation of the foreskin.  It may also appear in women and in the foreskin, blackness and corruption; then you should excise everything that is black and tending towards or already corrupted.
Then apply honey mixed with crushed and sifted pomegranate peel and  cress; then treat it with other treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped cautery of this form:
Cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and a wound if it becomes corrupted. If the cautery is consumed and disappears completely at some point, then you should insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it. As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the cautery...
This adhesion only happens in those whose foreskin is intact and who have not been circumcised.  It may also occur from a wound or swelling. Then you should incise it with a blunt scalpel until the bond is broken and the cautery is freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them on close inspection, then you should incise a little of the cautery and of the foreskin.  Because the foreskin is thin, it may perforate quickly due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin from the cautery with a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water, lest it adhere again.
Then treat it with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter fifty-seven.
On the cleansing of boys and the treatment of what may befall them of ailments.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of a connection like other wounds, except that since it is done by our will and especially used in boys, it is necessary that we describe the best procedure in it.
And the easiest path leading to safety, so I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws, but rather it is what we have acquired.
by experience, and that is that I found the majority of surgeons and barbers using purification with the scalpel and with scissors, and they use the cautery and ligature with thread and cutting with the fingernail. I have tried all these methods.
So I found nothing better than purification with scissors and ligature with thread, because purification with the scalpel often causes the skin to retract, because the skin of the foreskin is two layers, so perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower layer remains.
so it is necessary to cut again and renewed pain, and cauterization does not prevent cutting the tip of the urethra because it might enter its hole, and as for purification with the fingernail, the skin might slip and your work is spoiled or the boy's skin is naturally short...
so they are often born like that and do not need purification, and I have seen that, and as for purification with scissors and ligature with thread, experience revealed its advantage to me because the cut of the scissors is proportionate, because the blade above is like the blade below.
so when you squeeze your hand with the proportion of the two blades, you cut with one measure and in one time, so the ligature becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra from all sides, with no mistake at all, and the way of working is first to reassure the boy.
especially if he understands a little that you only tie the thread in his urethra and leave him until another day, then rejoice him and please him in every way you can, and what he accepts with his mind, then stop him before you standing upright.
and he should not be sitting, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy's eye does not fall upon it at all, nor on anything of the instruments, then you insert your hand into his urethra and inflate the skin and lift it up until the head of the urethra comes out.
Then you clean it from what gathers in it of dirt, then tie the marked place with a doubled thread, then tie a little below it a second ligature, then hold with your thumb and forefinger the place of the lower ligature a good hold and cut between the two ligatures. Then quickly lift the skin upwards and bring out the head of the urethra, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and less swelling of the urethra, then dry it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dry gourd, for it is the best I have tried, or fine barley flour, for it is also excellent.
Then quickly lift the skin upwards and bring out the head of the urethra, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and less swelling of the urethra, then dry it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dry gourd, for it is the best I have tried, or fine barley flour, for it is also excellent. Then apply on the sores from above in a piece of white cooked egg cloth cooked in rose water, beaten with fresh fragrant rose oil, and leave it on it until another day, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And this is the image of the scissors which are suitable for circumcision:
It should be sharp, cutting, not crooked, the nail smooth, and the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of the two handles. As for the mistake that occurs in circumcision, perhaps the entire inner skin or part of it is turned over during cutting, so you should stretch it with your fingernail before the place swells.
And cut it evenly; if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it with a thread and cut it. If three days pass and what is under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, then leave it until the acute inflammation subsides and then peel it gently.
And cut it as it suits you, and be careful of the head of the urethra, for if something of the head of the urethra is cut, it does not harm, so treat it with what heals the wound from the sores which we described in the chapter on sores.
And if some of the skin is cut above the amount and it retracts upwards, that also does not harm much, so treat it as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter fifty-eight.
On the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Urine retained in the bladder is due to its obstruction by a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or a growth of flesh, and the like.  If you treat that with what we mentioned of the types of treatment described in the classification.
And if the urine does not flow, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which has lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that the patient be made to sit on his knees, then let a man mount his back and extend his abdomen towards his back, and let the patient restrain himself as much as he can.
Then the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone backwards, and the urine will flow.  If it does not flow by what we have mentioned, and the matter becomes severe for the patient, then it is necessary that you use its extraction with the instrument called a catheter, whose form is this:
It is made of silver, and it is thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's quill in thinness, long about a span and a half, with a gentle funnel at its head.  The way to draw the urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie to its end wool or cotton tightly.
And insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the catheter and cut with scissors if any of the wool is in excess, so that it enters the tube and closes it like a button.  Then anoint the catheter with oil or butter or egg white, and seat the patient on a chair.
And cleanse his bladder and penis with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water. Then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside it.
Until, when the urethra is completely bent, then push the catheter inside until, when it reaches near the rectum, incline the penis downwards with the catheter inside it, then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has reached something empty.
This is done in this manner because the passage through which the urine passes is tortuous. Then pull the thread with the wool gently; then the urine will follow the wool. Then remove it, and the urine will flow out. Then replace the catheter.
Continue to do this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter fifty-nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
And the instruments suitable for this are made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as fine as pus.  And you wish to instill waters and medicines into it, which is done with an instrument called a syringe.  This is its image:
It is made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as fine as a millet stalk, hollow throughout except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow part in which the propellant is, is only as large as to contain it without excess, so that when you draw up something of the moisture, it is drawn up, and when you push it, it is pushed further, as the bellows does which throws oil in naval battles.
Then if you wish to place moisture in the bladder, you insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and draw upwards with the piston; then the moisture is drawn into the body of the syringe. Then you insert its tip into the urethra as we described in the catheters, then you push the moisture with the piston.
Then that moisture reaches the bladder in the same place until the patient feels it. And this is the image of a gentle clyster also with which the bladder is injected:
It is made of silver or lead, its upper end resembling a small funnel, and below it a groove in which the ligature lies. Then take a camel's bladder and put in it the liquid you wish to inject into the bladder, then tie it tightly between the two grooves with a doubled thread.
And warm that liquid a little over the fire, then insert the tip of the clyster into the urethra, then press your hand tightly on the bladder with the liquid until the patient feels that that liquid has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of thin leather and make a circle from it and pierce it all around. Then insert a strong thread into those holes as they are arranged, then gather the circle as you gather a bag after you have put in it what you want of liquids, ointments and water.
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the extraction of the stone.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and mentioned the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and the stone generated in the bladder, and the signs of all that, and mentioned the stone in which action by hand and incision is necessary.
This is the stone generated specifically in the bladder and that which becomes fixed in the urethra, and I am describing that with clear explanation and brevity.
So I say that the stone generated in the bladder most often affects boys, and among its signs is that the urine exits the bladder similar to water in its thinness.
And sand appears in it, and he scratches his penis and plays with it, and often it hangs down, then spreads, and the rectum protrudes with it in many of them.  It is easy to remove from boys until they reach fourteen years, and difficult in old men; as for young men, it is intermediate between the two.
And the one whose stone is larger, his treatment is easier, and the small one is the opposite.  So if we come to treatment, it is necessary first that the patient be given an enema to remove all the feces in his intestines, for it may prevent the finding of the stone upon examination.
Then the patient is taken by his feet, and he is shaken and jolted downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place repeatedly. Then you seat him between your hands upright, and his hands under his thighs, so that the whole bladder inclines downwards, then you examine him.
And palpate him externally. If you feel the stone in the space, act immediately to incise upon it. If it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you lubricate the index finger with ointment from the left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If he is a mature boy, then insert it into his rectum and search for the stone, until when it falls under your finger, move it little by little to the neck of the bladder. Then press upon it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place you want to incise.
And you order a servant to compress the bladder with his hand, and you order another servant to stretch with his right hand the labia upwards, and with his other hand to stretch the skin under the labia away from the place where the incision will be. Then take the sharp scalpel, whose picture is this:
And incise between the rectum and the labia, not in the middle, but towards the left side of the buttock.  The incision should be upon the stone itself, with your finger in the rectum, and you pressing it outwards obliquely, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, as much as is possible for the stone to exit from it.
Not larger, for perhaps the finger which is in the rectum will press the stone during the incision, and it will come out without difficulty. And know that there may be stones which have angles and edges, and therefore their exit is difficult.
And some are smooth, resembling an acorn and round, so their exit is easy. But those which have angles and edges, increase the incision a little.  If it does not come out like this, then it is necessary to devise a way for it, either by grasping it with a firm forceps whose end is like a rasp.
To hold the stone firmly so that it does not escape from it, or to insert under it a delicate instrument with a hooked end.  If you cannot manage it in this way, widen the incision a little. If you are overcome by blood, stanch it with alum.
If there is more than one, push the largest first towards the opening of the bladder, then incise upon it, then push the smaller ones afterwards.  And do likewise if there are more than two. If it is very large, then it is folly to make a large incision upon it, for this exposes the patient to one of two things.
Either he will die, or he will have a constant dribbling of urine because the place will not heal at all. But try to push it out, or devise a way to break it with forceps until you remove it in pieces.
When you have finished your work, dress the wound with mastic, aloes, and myrrh, and bind it. Place over it cloths moistened with oil and wine, or with rose oil and cold water, to calm the hot swelling. Then let the patient lie on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When it is loosened, wash the place with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with palm ointment and basil ointment until it heals. If excessive hot swelling, inflammation, or the like occurs in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder and preventing the passage of urine—which is known from the passage of blood with urine—
then insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood; for if it remains, it will lead to corruption and putrefaction of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type with its appropriate treatment until it heals.
In all these treatments, it is necessary to bind and draw together the thighs to secure the medicines applied to the place. If the stone is small and has lodged in the passage of the penis, preventing the passage of urine, treat it as I have described before it necessitates incision.
Often I have dispensed with incision by this treatment, which I have tested; it is that you take a slender instrument of steel, which is of this form:
The end triangular, sharp, and fixed in a shaft; then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, lest it return to the bladder; then gently insert the slender instrument into the urethra until the instrument reaches the stone itself.
And turn the instrument in the stone itself little by little, intending to pierce it until you pass through to the other side; then the urine will flow immediately. Then press with your hand on what remains of the stone from outside the penis, for it will crumble and come out with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not feasible for you due to some impediment, then tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then incise over the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures, and then remove it.
Then untie the ligature and clean away the clotted blood which has formed in the wound.  The reason for tying the thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other ligature above is so that when the thread is untied after removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should raise the skin upwards so that it returns and covers the wound as we have said.
Chapter sixty-one.
On the removal of stones in women.
Stones are rarely generated in women; but if one of them should suffer from a stone, its treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons. One is that the woman may be a virgin, and another that you will not find a woman who will allow herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is chaste or one of her relatives, and the third is that you will not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially the manual work, and the fourth is that the incision site in women is far from the stone, requiring a deep incision.
And in that there is danger. If necessity demands it, then a skilled female physician should be sought, but they are rarely found. If you cannot find one, then seek a chaste and gentle male physician, or engage a skilled midwife experienced in women's matters, or a woman who has some knowledge of this craft.
Then have her present and instruct her to do all that you order her to do, first examining for the stone.  That is, if the woman is a virgin, she should insert a finger into her rectum and search for the stone. If she finds it and presses it under her finger,
then instruct her to incise it. If she is not a virgin but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it firmly.
If she finds it, she should push it from the mouth of the bladder downwards as far as she can, until she reaches the groin, then incise at the point opposite the middle of the vulva at the groin, whichever side she can reach and feels the stone on that side.
Her finger should not leave the stone, pressing it beneath. The incision should be small at first, then introduce the dilator into that small incision. If she feels the stone, enlarge the incision to the extent that she knows the stone will come out. And know that there are many types of stones.
Some are small, some large, some smooth, some rough, some long, some round, some branched.  Know their types so that you may thereby know what you seek. If the bleeding overcomes you, sprinkle powdered verdigris on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
until the stone comes out.  Prepare yourself with the instruments I mentioned for removing stones from men, to assist you in your work. If bleeding overcomes you and you know from the pulse of the blood that it is from a severed artery, apply styptics to the area.
Bind it tightly with bandages and leave it; do not disturb it, and leave the stone; do not remove it, for the patient might die.  Then treat the wound.  When the severity of the bleeding has subsided after a few days and the area has become infected, return to your work until you remove the stone.
Chapter sixty-two.
On the incision upon the watery bladder.
The watery bladder is an accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle, and it is called the scrotum. It may be in a special membrane prepared for it by nature in a part of the testicle.
So that one thinks it is another testicle. It is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum that we mentioned, but this is rare. This bladder is generated from weakness that affects the testicles, so this matter settles there, and it may result from a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture is of many colors; sometimes it is yellowish, sometimes bloody red, sometimes black and purulent, and sometimes white and watery, which is most frequent. The signs by which it is known are:
Where the water collects, if it is in the white peritoneum that we mentioned, then the swelling is round, slightly elongated like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in a special membrane for it, then the swelling is round on one side of the testicle.
Therefore, a person imagines that it is another testicle. If the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum, then it is palpable. But if you wish to know the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose image we have presented; whatever comes out in the wake of the probe, you judge it according to what is inside.
If we proceed to treatment with the cautery, then you should order the patient to be bled if he can tolerate it and you see that his body is full.  Then he should lie on his back on something slightly raised, and you place many cloths under him. Then you sit on his left.
And you order a servant to sit on his right, stretching his penis to one side of the scrotum's skin and toward the groin. Then you take a wide scalpel and incise the scrotum's skin lengthwise in the middle to near the pubis.
And make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotum's skin in half, until you reach the white peritoneum which contains [the testicle]; then peel it back and be careful not to tear it. Your peeling should be from the side that adheres to the testicle more, and complete the peeling as much as you can.
Then you widely incise the peritoneum full of water and drain all the water. Then you separate the edges of the incision with hooks and stretch the peritoneum upwards, without touching the containing scrotum skin, and cut the peritoneum however you can cut it, either all at once or piece by piece.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not completely cut it, you will not be safe from the water returning. If the testicle protrudes outside its skin during your work, then, once you have finished cutting the peritoneum, return it, then close the edges of the scrotum skin with sutures.
Then treat it like any other wound until it heals. If the testicle is already damaged by another disease, then you should ligate the vessels in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat it as we have described.
If the fluid is collected in both sides, then know that they are two hydroceles. Incise the other side in the same way as you did the first. If it is better for you to do the procedure at once, then do so. Then wipe away the blood.
And you insert into the incisions wool that you have dipped in oil or rose ointment, and you place on the outside another wool that you have dipped in a potion and oil, and spread it over the testicles and the flanks of the abdomen, and place folded cloths on top, which are the compresses. And you tie them on top with a bandage which has six ends, in this manner:
Then two cloths are taken, sewn together, and stuffed with carded wool in this manner.  The ties used to fasten it are made of cotton or wet wool, and are gathered tightly in the waistband of the trousers, and one end is taken to the buttocks and towards the back.
And the second is taken towards the pubis, and the two ends to the thighs below, and the remaining two ends to the groins; and all the tightening is gathered in the waistband of the trousers. And this hydrocele may also be treated by cauterization instead of incision with an iron.
It is that you take a small, sharp cautery iron and with it you incise the skin of the scrotum while it is hot, as we have described, until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed. Then take another cautery iron, in this manner:
It resembles the Greek eye, then you cauterize that peritoneum with it while it is hot until all the moisture comes out. Then you stretch the peritoneum with hooks and flay the containing layer with the cautery and cut it as much as you can, until you excise all of it, and you preserve the testicle, so that the fire does not touch it.
And know that this procedure is safer and prevents more bleeding, and is better than the procedure with incision.  If you are confronted during the incision or during the cauterization by a hot swelling or bleeding or something else, then you should treat whatever confronts you with the treatment appropriate for it, as previously explained.
If the patient is cowardly and does not endure this procedure because of its unpleasantness, then let him use cauterization as I describe, if it is confirmed for you by what we have presented of evidence.
That the hydrocele is watery, then the patient should sit on a raised chair, then cauterize the swelling at its base with a wide scalpel, and make the cauterization along the length of the body, and the opening should be wide so that all the water flows out. Then place cotton on the place and bandage it.
And leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the exit of the water is hindered during your cauterization, and it is only because the tunica albuginea obstructs the mouth of the wound and prevents the exit of the water,
then it is necessary to insert into the wound a goose feather or the instrument with which the water of hydroceles is extracted, the image of which has preceded, or enlarge the opening of the wound a little.
And know that the water may return and collect after six months or so. If it collects, cauterize it in the same manner, and the patient should protect himself during those days.
Chapter Sixty-Three.
Concerning the incision on the fleshy membrane and its treatment.
Know that an incision on this membrane is one of the dangerous things leading to death in most instances; therefore, we consider leaving it alone and being safe from it, although I will mention the treatment and types of swelling.
I say that many swellings may occur in the bodies which consist of the testicles, and this is due to many causes, either from a sharp humor that descends to the testicles, or from a blow; and the color of the swelling is the color of the body, and it contains no water.
And the swelling may be soft, and perhaps the swelling may be hardened, its color dark, and it has no sensation.  It may be from the entanglement and swelling of the arteries, as has been previously mentioned, or from the swelling of the veins.  That which is from the swelling of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the swelling.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be dispersed at all. As for that which is from the swelling of the veins, nothing of it disperses when pressed with the fingers, and this type may possibly be incised, as with other flesh.
And that is to incise the skin of the testicle, then extend the testicle upward and remove it from the white peritoneum, and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and ligate the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from every part of the testicle, if the testicle has adhered to that growing flesh.
Then it is necessary to remove the testicle and cut it. And if the adhesion is between some of the peritonea or between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
If the growth of flesh is in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary to cut it all and remove the testicle as we said.  When your work is completed, dress the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter sixty-four.
In the treatment of hydrocele with a hernia.
A hernia is a twisted tumor, somewhat twisted, resembling a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking. The treatment of this disease is similar to what has been mentioned before.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as the ancients did. I say that it is necessary to seat the patient on a high chair, then push the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards, then grasp the skin of the testicle with your fingers along with the vessels which are near the penis.
And let your assistant hold it and stretch it tightly, then you incise with a wide, sharp scalpel an oblique incision along the vessels until the vessels are exposed, then dissect from each side as I described to you in the dissection of the arteries in the armpits, then insert a needle with a doubled thread.
And tie it at the first place where the hernia appeared and tie it also at its end, then incise it in the middle with a vertical incision along the body and remove what has gathered inside of it from the foul, putrid fluids.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of all other wounds so that a period of time elapses for the vessels that nourish one of the testicles to fall away, there is no harm in that.  If the hernia involves all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove one of the testicles with the vessels lest the testicle lack nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, they will wither and be of no use.
Chapter Sixty-five.
In the treatment of intestinal hernia.
This hernia occurs from a tear that appears in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen towards the groins from the abdominal cavity, and the intestine descends from that rupture into one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its distension.  These two types occur from many causes, either a blow, a jump, a shout, lifting something heavy, and the like.  Its sign, if it is from a distension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is even towards the depth because the peritoneum constricts the intestine.  Its sign, if it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that it initially causes great pain suddenly, and the swelling is uneven, appearing under the skin nearby.
That is by the exit of the intestine and its passage outside of the peritoneum.  And the omentum may exit with the intestine, and this hernia is called intestinal and omental.  It may be with gas. And the feces may pass into the intestine and be retained there, resulting in the death of the patient.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling, especially if constricted.  Treatment of these types of illness with cautery is dangerous, so it should be avoided.  The method of treatment is to order the patient to return the intestine with his hand to the inside of his abdomen if it is possible to return it.
Then he lies on his back in your hands and raises his legs. Then you stretch the skin next to the groin upwards and incise the skin of the scrotum entirely lengthwise. Then you insert hooks into the edges of the incision as much as is needed to open the incision with them.
And the incision should be such that the testicle can come out of it. Then you dissect the membranes under the skin of the scrotum until the white, hard peritoneum is exposed on every side. Then insert your index finger into what is next to the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum which is under the skin of the testicle and the second peritoneum, and you loosen the adhesion which is behind the testicle. Then you pull with the right hand into the scrotum's skin and with this you stretch the white peritoneum upward with the left hand and lift the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision.
And you order the assistant to pull the testicle upward, and you yourself completely loosen the adhesion from behind.  And you search with your finger lest there be something of the twisted intestine in the hard white peritoneum; and if you find some, push it down into the abdomen.
Then you take a needle with a thick thread, twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum under the scrotum's skin which is next to the incision. Then you cut the ends of the thread's fold until there are four threads. Then you place some on top of others in a firm manner and tie the peritoneum—which we said is under the scrotum’s skin—with it tightly on two sides. Then you also twist the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing from the vessels which nourish it can reach it. Lest a hot swelling result from that, and you make also a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers. And after these two ligatures you leave of the peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum the amount of a finger bone.
Lest a hot swelling result from that, and you make also a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers. And after these two ligatures you leave of the peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum the amount of a finger bone. And you cut all the rest in a circle and remove the testicle with it. Then you make an incision below the scrotum's skin so that blood and pus flow out as we described before. Then use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and use the ligature that we described.
And the white peritoneum, which we said, may be cauterized after cutting it, cautiously against bleeding, for that often happens.  And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself; and if it is slow to fall off, then loosen it with warm water and apply something that sweats it until it falls.
Then treat the wound with all the treatments of wounds until it heals.
Chapter sixty-six.
Concerning the windy hernia.  I have not seen anyone dare to treat this windy hernia with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described in the hernia with a stalk; that is, that the vessels should be gently tied below after the incision upon it.
Then incise in the middle and treat the tumor with that which opens it until the vessels fall and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter sixty-seven.
Concerning the hernia which is in the groin.
A hernia may appear in the groin, as we said, so that the place swells, and nothing of the intestine descends into the scrotum; and if it descends, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if time elapses, the fissure in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and epiploon descend into the scrotum, and this occurs from the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we said. That is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and the place swells and protrudes, and its treatment is by cauterization, as I have previously described.
And it may be treated with the cautery in this manner: the patient lies on his back between your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia transversely to the extent of three fingers, then you separate the peritoneal layers which are under the skin.
Until, when the white peritoneum which follows is exposed, you take a probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and push it into the depth of the abdomen, then you sew the two protruding parts of the peritoneum to the edge of the probe, and you fasten one to the other with the suture.
Then you withdraw the probe, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle nor anything else, as I have informed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then you treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Then if the threads are cut, I clean them and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the protrusion of the hernia does not increase.
And cauterization is better in this place because it is closer to safety.
Chapter sixty-eight.
On the relaxation of the skin of the scrotum.
Often the skin of the scrotum relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, and its appearance is unsightly.  He who wishes to treat it should lay the patient on his back.
And he cuts all the relaxed skin over the thick skin, then gathers the lips together. And if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, and make sure of the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, I should not have mentioned it in this book. However, I mentioned it for two reasons: the first is so that the physician may know about it if he is asked, and so that he may know the treatment of someone who has undergone it; and the second is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as lambs, goats, cats, and similar animals.  I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by incision and cutting.  As for that which is done by crushing, its method is that we seat the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.
Then crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not discernible to the touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, you should hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with your left hand, then tie the cords and make one incision on each testicle.
Until the testicles emerge, then cut them after you have skinned them, and do not leave any of the membranes on them except the thin membrane that is on the vessels. This type of castration is better than that which is done by crushing.
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal may still desire mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two types. One is that which appears in the area following the scrotum, or in the skin of the scrotum between the testicles, in a form like a woman's vulva, with hair. Urine may flow from that which is in the scrotum's skin.
As for women, there is one type. It is above the vulva, on the pubis, like small male genitals, protruding outward. One is like a man's penis, and the two are like testicles.  And the treatment of the three types.
The two types in men and the one type in women: it is necessary to cut away that excess flesh until its trace is removed, then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals. As for the second type in men, from which urine flows, which is in the scrotum's skin, there is no action in it, nor is there any benefit from removing it.
Chapter seventy-one.
On the excision of the clitoris and the protruding flesh from the vulvas of women.
The clitoris sometimes exceeds the natural amount, so that it becomes large and ugly in appearance. And it may grow large in some women, even spreading like in men and leading to sexual intercourse.
Then you should grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it.  Do not exaggerate in the cutting, especially in the depth of the root, lest bleeding occurs.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And sometimes it protrudes outwards like a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients call it the "tail disease."  Then you should cut it as you cut the clitoris, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On the treatment of prolapse.
Prolapse is when a woman's vulva is not perforated, or the perforation is small. This may be congenital or acquired.  The acquired type results from a previously existing condition, and may be due to an excess of growing flesh.
or a thin or thick membrane. This may be located in the depth of the uterus, or in its sides, or above or below it. It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and sometimes menstruation.  This is determined by examination by the midwife.
If the obstruction is visible and near, then if it is not visible, she should examine it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is a thin membrane and is close to the labia, then proceed to rupture it. This is done by placing something like pledgets on the labia, then placing the thumbs of both hands.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread apart. Then, forcefully stretch the labia until the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is opened. Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area. The woman should have intercourse every day so that the area does not close again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel resembling an aspen leaf. If the obstruction is from excess flesh, hang it with hooks and cut it. You should have styptics at hand that do not sting, such as acacia, myrrh, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not close quickly. Keep it in place for several days and use a dry linen wick. Then treat it with the usual healing treatments until it heals.  Another growth of flesh may appear in the uterus; this should be cut in the same way.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor.  A cancerous tumor in the uterus should never be treated with iron.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that appear in the vulva of women.
As for hemorrhoids, it is a swelling of the mouths of the veins, so that much blood constantly flows from them. If hemorrhoids persist, they become warts. I have already mentioned their types and signs in the classification, and we will mention them here.
What accepts treatment and what does not accept treatment. I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep in the uterus and do not appear to the touch, have no treatment with iron. Those that are in the mouth of the uterus and can be felt are those that are treated.
It is necessary that the woman enter a cold house, then she should stretch the warts with a scraper or a rough cloth and cut them from their roots. Then she should apply to them, when the blood flows, one of the styptics that stops blood without cauterizing.
Such as acacia,  Sumac, frankincense and the like. Then she should raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding persists, seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peel, gallnut, and the like. Then take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it as a compress to her back. If the blood stops, otherwise, apply cupping to the loins and breasts without condition. Then take wool, dip it in the juice of the thorny plant, or the juice of Plantago, or the juice of the branches of the bindweed with a gallic syrup, and apply it to the place.
When the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pimples, they resemble the heads of the intestines, rough in appearance. It is necessary to cut what appears of them, according to what I mentioned in the case of warts, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the suppuration which occurs in the uterus.
Many kinds of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, the hardened tumor, ulcers, fistulas, phagedena, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and the hot tumor. I have already mentioned all these diseases, their types, and their symptoms in the classification.
It is necessary that we mention in this section the hot tumor which occurs in the uterus, if it is one of the tumors which collect for a period, how its suppuration is with iron. It is necessary to look; if the pain of the tumor is initially severe with throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
And if you see it red when touched, do not hasten to its suppuration, and treat it with what helps in ripening until these symptoms subside. Then it is necessary that the woman sit on a chair with two seats and lean on its back.
And she gathers her legs towards the lower abdomen, and her thighs are spread apart, and her arms are under her knees, and they are bound with a suitable bandage.
Therefore, then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the mouth of the uterus is opened, whose image comes later. It is necessary, if you want to use this instrument, to estimate with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.
Then it harms the patient. If the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary to place pledgets on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus.  And it is necessary that the spiral which runs in the instrument be from the upper side.
And you hold the instrument and the assistant turns the spiral until the cervix is opened. Then, if the abscess appears and is touched by the hand and is soft and thin, then it is necessary to incise it at its head with a wide scalpel.  Then, when all the matter is evacuated,
it is necessary to place in the wound a soft tent soaked in rose oil or green oil containing some astringent. And the tent is placed outside the incision in the cervix, and clean wool soaked in water in which alum has been boiled is placed externally on the uterus and on the pubis.
Then, it is treated after two days with the ointment which is suitable for that until it heals.
And the uterus and wound may be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water in which liquorice root or long rhubarb has been boiled, then return to the ointment. If the abscess is hidden inside the uterus,
then it is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, but it is treated with what we mentioned in the classification.
Chapter seventy-five.
In teaching midwives how to treat live fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the form of natural childbirth.  Its signs are: if you see the woman straining downwards and yearning to breathe the air, and what she is suffering from childbirth becomes easier for her.
And the emergence of the fetus is hastened. Know that this birth is in the natural form, and its emergence is head first with the afterbirth with it or attached to its navel. If you see these signs, then it is necessary to press her abdomen so that the fetus emerges quickly.
For if it descends head first, the afterbirth descends with it and is cleansed of those impurities well. Whatever is besides this birth is unnatural and blameworthy, because the fetus may emerge on its feet, and its hands may emerge before its head and feet.
And one of its hands or one of its feet, or its head and hand may emerge, or it may emerge folded, and perhaps it may turn onto its back, and similar blameworthy forms.  It is necessary for the midwife to be skillful and gentle with all of these things and to beware of slips and mistakes.
And I am explaining each form and how the method is in it so that you may be guided by that and understand it. If the fetus emerges head first, the natural emergence, and that is difficult for the woman and labor is difficult for her, and you see her strength has weakened, then seat her on a chair and order women to hold her.
And compress her womb with cooked fenugreek and with moist ointments, then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers and cuts the afterbirth with it, or cuts it with her fingernail until the moisture inside it flows out, and she presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then it is necessary to inject the woman with fenugreek saliva with shirāj ointment, then after the injection, order her to strain and make her sneeze with a sternutatory and hold her mouth and nose, for the fetus will emerge immediately. If the hands of the fetus emerge first, then it is necessary to return them gently little by little.
If they do not manage to enter, then place the woman on a stool and raise her legs upwards, then shake the stool on the ground and the woman holds on so that she does not fall when shaken. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, then cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them moderately, for then it will come out. The emergence of the fetus on its feet: if the fetus emerges on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards, then turn the fetus little by little until you straighten it, then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
If they come out to the thighs, then order her to strain and make her sneeze with a sternutatory, for then it will come out. If it does not come out as we described, otherwise return the fetus little by little until you put it in its natural form, for then it will come out easily. If it is prevented by all that we have described.
Then take some saliva of the *khatmi*, and saliva of fenugreek, and shirāj ointment, and dissolved gum, and pound everything well in a mortar, then apply it to the vulva of the woman and the lower part of her abdomen, then seat her in lukewarm water until it reaches the sharasif.
If you see that her lower parts have become soft, then make a pessary for her from myrrh and let her bear it. If the pessary is held for an hour, then seat her on a chair, then make her sneeze and close her mouth and nose, and gently press on her lower abdomen, for the fetus will come out immediately. The emergence of the fetus on its knees and hands:
If it comes out in this manner, then gradually introduce your hands, then let the woman lie on her back and hang her hips downwards while lying on a bed, and let her clasp her hands, then press gently on her abdomen. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that her lower parts are raised. If the fetus does not come out, then take both her legs and move them vigorously, then press gently above the sharasif until the fetus ascends upwards, then the midwife inserts her hand and adjusts the fetus little by little.
And order the woman to strain until the fetus comes out. The emergence of the fetus sideways, hanging by one of its hands.  Try to return its hand; if you are not able to return it, then make the woman stand and make her walk. If she is not able to walk, then let her lie down.
on her bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then use the poultice which I described from the saliva. If labor pains seize her, then seat her on a chair, then treat to return the hand and adjust the fetus into its natural shape, and make the woman sneeze and order her to strain until it comes out.
The emergence of the fetus on its back, extending its hands, and its face towards its mother's back. The midwife should grasp the hand of the fetus, then turn it little by little and adjust it gently.  When it is straightened, apply to its head what we described of ointment and saliva.
Then tell her to move little by little. If she does that, then seat her on the chair and tell her to lean to the right side. Then tell her to strain and make her sneeze with the khandas, then it will come out.  The emergence of the fetus upright on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then tear the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture. If it is attached to the face and neck of the fetus, then cut it from the navel lest it suffocate and die, then push the fetus inwards until it is as it should be.
And tell the woman to strain repeatedly, then it will come out easily. The emergence of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins frequently are born, and three or four may be born and live, although this is rare. As for five, it is something outside of nature; they will not live at all.
And they are surrounded, even if numerous, by one afterbirth, and they are separated by a membranous partition between them, attached to the navel of each one. And they may emerge like a single fetus, naturally and easily, and they may emerge in a reprehensible manner as we described.
If some of them are difficult at birth and become as we mentioned, in unnatural forms, then treat them as we described. Let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and slowness, and she should contrive for every form with whatever means is available to her that leads to safety.
Mentioning what is conceived in the womb of fetuses that are aborted. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the womb. It has been confirmed for me that a woman aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of them conceived.
By the estimation of the All-Knowing and All-Powerful, all of this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, for perhaps such a thing may occur to her one day, so she may confront it properly.
Chapter seventy-six.
On the extraction of a dead fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus with what I mentioned in the section on treatment, and it does not come out, and the matter necessitates you to work with your hand, then you should look: if the woman is healthy and strong and does not have any of the symptoms that one fears may cause her harm, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
And her head should be tilted downwards and her legs raised, and a servant should support her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, lest her body be pulled when the fetus is extracted.
Then moisten her vulva with moist ointments, along with mallow sap, fenugreek, and flaxseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these ointments and juices, and gently insert it into the uterus, then search for a place to hook the forceps onto the fetus, and the appropriate places for this.
Look: if the fetus is positioned to descend head first, then hook the forceps into its eyes, or its nape, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin, or its shoulder, or in places near the ribs, or under the clavicles.
But if it descends feet first, then [hook the forceps] in the pubic area and the middle ribs.  The forceps should be held in the right hand, its bend between the fingers of the left hand, and the hand should be gently inserted and a hook placed in one of those mentioned places.
Until you reach something firm, then insert another hook opposite it, or a third if necessary, so that the traction is even and does not pull to one side. Then pull with a steady pull, not only straight, but moving it in every direction.
So that its exit is facilitated, as is done with a tooth when it is extracted.  In between, the pull should be relaxed; if it becomes stuck on one side, the midwife should anoint some fingers with ointment and insert them from that side to move what is stuck. If part of the fetus emerges, then move the hooks to other places.
It is slightly raised, doing this until the entire fetus emerges. If a hand emerges before anything else and cannot be returned because it is compressed, then a cloth should be wrapped around it and pulled until it is completely out, then cut.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.  This should be done to the other hand and to the feet. If the head of the fetus is large and experiences difficulty in exiting, or if there is accumulated water in its head, then a lancet should be inserted between the fingers.
And split the head with it so that the water comes out, or puncture it with the instrument called the *mushdakh*, the image of which appears with the images of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this.
Similarly, if the fetus is naturally large-headed, the skull should be split or crushed with the *mushdakh*, as we have said, then the bones should be removed with forceps.  If the head emerges and is compressed at the clavicle, it should be split so that the moisture in the chest pours out.
For the chest then becomes constricted. If the chest does not become constricted and it is not possible for it to emerge, then cut as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or has a tumor, it should be punctured until the moisture flows from it.
If the fetus is feet first, then pulling it out and straightening it towards the mouth of the womb is easy. If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, then it should be pulled with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and the abdomen or chest should be split so that what is in them flows out.
If all the other members are extracted and the head remains behind and is retained, let the midwife insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, let her insert her hand into the neck of the womb and seek the head with it and pull it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb, then insert a hook or two hooks into it and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the womb has closed due to a hot swelling that has occurred in it, it should not be forced; rather, it should be treated with the application of moist, oily substances, and compresses should be used, and [the patient] should sit in waters that relax and moisten.
But if the fetus is on its side, if it is possible to straighten it, then let what we mentioned for a living fetus be used. If this is not possible, then let it be cut and removed.  Nothing of the afterbirth should be left inside at all. When you have finished your treatment, use what we mentioned for the treatment of hot swellings which occur in the wombs.
If bleeding occurs, let [the patient] descend into astringent waters and use all other treatments. I have seen a woman who had conceived, and the fetus died in her womb, and then she conceived again upon it.
Then the other fetus also died. After a long time, a swelling appeared in her uterus and it swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close, so I put some strong, drawing ointments on it.
Then a bone came out of the place, and after some days another bone came out. I was amazed by this, since the abdomen is not a place where there are bones. I judged that they were from the bones of the dead fetus, so I examined the wound and removed many bones of the fetus's skull from it.
I continued to do this until I removed many bones, and the woman was in the best of health.  She lived for some time after that, with a small amount of pus discharging from the place. And I have only related this unusual case here.
because it contains knowledge and aid for what the skillful physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
In it are images of the instruments needed for removing the fetus.
Image of a spiral instrument to open the mouth of the womb.
This is a binder with which books are bound, having two spirals at the ends of the two pieces of wood, except that this spiral should be finer than the binder and should be either of ebony or of boxwood, and the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers.
And their breadth is about a finger and their length is a span and a half, and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two strips of the same kind of wood, which are fastened in them, their length being half a span or a little more, and their breadth about two fingers or a little more, and these two strips...
are those which enter the mouth of the womb to open it by turning the spirals. Image of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter.
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two strips at its end, as you see; the length of each strip is about a span, and their width is two fingers.  If you wish to open the womb with it,
then seat the woman on a bed with her legs hanging down, spread apart between her thighs, then insert these two strips together into the mouth of the womb, while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs, then open your hand with the instrument as you do with hooks, as much as you want to open the womb. until the midwife does what she wants.  Image of another spiral mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument which pushes out the fetus.
Image of the forceps with which the head of the fetus is grasped.
It resembles scissors, it has teeth at the end as you see, and it may be made rectangular like hooks, in this image as you see, it has teeth like the teeth of a saw, to cut and tear with.
Image of a pusher also.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so that it does not break when pulling the fetus with it. Image of a hook with two barbs.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All of these instruments, the more numerous their types and the better prepared they are by the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his standing among people. Therefore, do not despise any instrument that you have prepared, for there will certainly be a need for it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
On the removal of the afterbirth.
If the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold herself, then have her sneeze with a handkerchief, and press your hand on her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out in this way, well and good; otherwise, take a measure.
And pierce a hole in the lid and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as fumitory, rue, dill, chamomile, wormwood, marshmallow, and centaury – all of these drugs or some of them – and immerse them in water and place them over the fire, then place a silver tube on the hole in the lid of the pot and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
And hold it until the vapor reaches the bottom of the womb, then have her sneeze as we said; then the afterbirth will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in sherbet oil or mallow sap.
Then she inserts it into the vagina and searches for the afterbirth; if she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out little by little. If it is attached deep in the womb, insert the hand as we described until, when you find the afterbirth, pull it out little by little, carefully.
Lest the womb fall out with strong pulling; rather, it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then the amount of pulling is increased; then it will yield and free itself from the adhesion. If the mouth of the womb is constricted, we have described the treatment with sneezing, and the treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, avoid violence in pulling it again; but it should be tied from what has come out of it to the mouth of the womb to the woman's thigh, then inject it with the quadruple ointment, for it will cause it to rot after a few days.
And it will dissolve and come out; however, if it rots, a bad smell will ascend from it to the stomach and head, and this will harm the patient; therefore, appropriate fumigation should be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients have tried the fumigation of rue and dried figs.  The image of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated when menstruation and the afterbirth are retained, and so on:
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or it is made of copper; the thin end is placed in the vagina, and the wide end over the fire, and the incense is placed on the embers; it is held until that incense is gone, and then another is added.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
In the treatment of the non-perforated fistula.
Many boys are born with their rectums imperforate; a thin membrane may have closed it.  It is necessary for the midwife to pierce this membrane with her finger, otherwise let her incise it with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to touch the muscle.
Then she should apply wool soaked in wine and oil, and then treat it with ointments until it heals. If she fears that it will close up, she should place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
The occlusion of the rectum may also occur from the healing of a wound or a tumor; this adhesion should be incised, and then treated as previously mentioned, with treatment and the lead tube.
Chapter Eighty.
In the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower parts.
Fistulas which occur in the lower parts are a complication and thickening which occurs near the rectum externally or in the space from one of the sides, and the fistula may be single or multiple.
If this complication becomes chronic, it opens and a watery white moisture or thin pus flows from it.  Some of these fistulas may penetrate to the perineum and to the intestine, and some may not penetrate.  Those which penetrate may be recognized by what comes out of them of feces and flatus when the patient defecates.
And perhaps worms come out of them.  There may be fistulas, if they are in the space, which penetrate to the bladder and to the urethra.  And there may be some which penetrate to the hip joint and to the sacrum. And what distinguishes the fistula which penetrates to the rectum from that which does not penetrate is also known.
That you insert your index finger into the rectum and insert a thin probe into the fistula of copper or iron, if the fistula is not tortuous. If it is tortuous, then insert into it a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger. If you do not feel it at all, and nothing of feces, nor flatus, nor worms, as we said, emerges from the opening, then know that it is not penetrating, so proceed to treatment.
And if the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urethra, the indication is the passage of urine from it and the inability of the place to heal with medication. And if it penetrates to the hip joint or to the sacrum, its sign is the arrival of the probe there.
If there is no tortuosity to the bone and the presence of pain in that direction and the constant discharge of pus from it, and no treatment is effective and it does not heal with ointment, these penetrating fistulas, all of them, are incurable.
And their treatment is a vain effort for those who attempt them among ignorant physicians.  As for those that are not penetrating and not chronic, recovery is hoped for with cautery as I describe and as I have tested.  It is that the patient lies on his back between your hands.
And he raises his legs upwards and his thighs incline towards his abdomen, then you insert a copper or lead probe if there is tortuosity in the fistula until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel with your finger the probe having penetrated by itself, exposed without feeling between your finger and it any membrane or flesh, then know for certain that it is penetrating, so do not tire yourself with it, for there is no cure for it, as we said.
And they have said that it heals in some people rarely. And of the treatments for which benefit is hoped for is that you heat a thin cautery iron according to the size of the fistula as has been explained, and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches towards the anus, then repeat it two or three times.
Until you know that all that excess, matted flesh resembling the tube of a bird's feather has been burned. Then treat it with lint soaked in butter until that burned flesh comes out, then treat it with healing ointments, if it heals.
And otherwise it will never heal with any other treatment. But if you insert the probe and it does not penetrate to your finger which is in the anus, and there was between it and the probe a thick partition of flesh or of membrane, and you saw the fistula in what is near the surface of the skin, then incise the skin from the beginning of the fistula. And you pass with the incision along with the probe while it is in the fistula until you reach with the incision where the end of the probe has reached, and the probe is released and falls out. Then you cleanse that matted flesh resembling a bird's feather tube, and leave nothing of it.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If blood overwhelms you and prevents you from your work of cutting that flesh, then the best and quickest remedy you can do is cauterization with fire or with a caustic medicine; for cauterization with fire combines two good things: burning that excess flesh.
and cutting the blood and drying the moisture. Then treat it with lint soaked in butter or sulfur powdered with oil until the place suppurates and that burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that grow firm flesh.
These are the medicines which have astringent and drying properties; for when it is closed, it has healed, and you do not fear a return. If the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is far from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it a partition of peritoneum or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then the treatment is only by way of hope and expectation; that is, to use one of three methods: either to cauterize it as we said.
Or to incise it until you reach its bottom so that you can easily insert the lint and treat it from close by. Do not go too far with the incision lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus and cause the patient involuntary evacuation of stool. Then treat it as we have mentioned; perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or to penetrate that partition and pierce it after incising it near the anus as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp-pointed instrument. Then cleanse all the hardened flesh in the incision as far as you can, completely.
Then sew up the whole wound, including the incision and the upper opening, until it is closed, and leave the fistula open inside the anus. This will be easier for the patient.  The fistula may perforate in this manner.
And if you insert the probe into the fistula and it is in a part of the anus towards the surface of the body with the skin and the circumference of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip like a shoemaker's needle, in this form:
And insert into it a twisted thread of five or similar threads, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom. If it penetrates into the margin of the anus from the inside nearby.
Then bring out the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and bringing out the end of the thread. Bring both ends together and tighten them, and leave it for a day or two. Every time the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads is severed and falls away. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the fistula is not perforated, perforate it however you can, except that if it is very deep, you should not do this because of the muscle, lest you cut it. Then do as we have mentioned until it heals.
The image of the hooked scalpel with which fistulas are incised.  The bend is very sharp, and the other side is not sharp, lest you cut what is not needed, as you see.
Chapter eighty-one.
Concerning the perforation of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the rectum, resembling red bladders or like grapes, and they are small and large, and blood constantly flows from them.
And there may be one or many, and they may be outside the rectum and at its edges, except that those which are outside the rectum are, in most cases, less moist; a yellow fluid or a little blood flows from them constantly, and they are the color of the body.
The treatment for those which are inside the rectum is that you order the patient to strain and bear down until the rectum protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you quickly grasp them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail and then cut them at their bases. If the hooks do not hold because of their moisture and laxness,
then rub them with a rough cloth or a piece of goatskin, or pull them with your fingers, then cut them.  Then, after cutting, sprinkle on them some sharp powders to act in place of cautery, or cauterize them as previously described in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If the rectum does not protrude, then inject the patient with an enema containing a little irritant to wash what is in the rectum and to facilitate its rapid protrusion when the patient strains. As for the hemorrhoids outside the rectum, their treatment is easy and simple.
That is, you take it with your fingernail or grasp it with a hook and cut it, then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals. And whoever dislikes cutting with iron should use a ligature in this manner: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the hemorrhoid upwards and pass the needle through its base from the other side, and wrap the ends of the thread below the needle while it is across, and pull the hemorrhoid tightly. Then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this to all the hemorrhoids, leaving one unligated.
so that the excess blood flows out. Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or kyrios on the rectum and tell the patient to remain still.  Then leave him until they fall off. When the hemorrhoids have fallen off, treat them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often occur from dryness of the stool and retention of the temperament. If it becomes chronic and medicine does not work, then it should be scraped with a scalpel blade or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper layer which prevents it from healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more severely than before until it bleeds well and is excised, then treat it, for it will heal.
Chapter eighty-two.
On the treatment of ingrown and non-ingrown nails, dry warts, and anthills.
A nail is a round nodule, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail; it occurs throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and the toes, and causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to incise around the nail, grasp it with a hook or forceps, and remove it from its root, then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it as described in its chapter.  As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, hardened, round protrusion on the surface of the body.
They often appear on the hands of children.  Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it, or pierce it with a silk thread or hair until it falls off; and if you wish, cauterize it with fire or a caustic medicine as previously described.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts may be removed with the instrument I mentioned in the treatment of anthills. As for anthills, they are also small, hardened, thick protrusions on the surface of the body, extending deep; and if they are affected by cold, a sensation similar to the stinging of ants is felt in them.
They occur throughout the body, most often on the hands.  Its treatment is to take a tube made from a strong goose or eagle feather, place the tube over the anthill so that the circumference of the tube surrounds it on all sides, then rotate the tube with your hand until you have incised around the anthill.
Then push it into the depth of the flesh, and the anthill will be removed from its root. And if you wish, you may do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:
The top of the tube should be solid and twisted to facilitate gripping and turning it with the fingers. And if you wish, cauterize the anthill as previously described in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
Concerning the instruments used for injections in cases of rectal disorders, diarrhea, and colic.
A syringe may be made of silver, china, or cast or beaten copper.  Small and large sizes of this instrument may be made according to the users. Those used in treating small children should be small, and those for patients with narrow or painful rectums should be very gentle. Image of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, to which the bladder is tied, is wide in this manner; it has a partition where the bladder is tied, as you see, and its lower end, which is inserted into the rectum, is solid and very smooth, except that on one side there are two holes and on the other side one hole.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of, or slightly thicker than, an awl. The bladder, in which the medicine is placed, is made from an animal's bladder or sheepskin, shaped like a small pouch, its diameter being a span.
Many holes are pierced in it in a circular pattern, the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger. Then a strong thread of twisted yarn, of ten or so strands, is inserted into these holes and the bladder is gathered together like a pouch. Then, when the medicine is placed inside, it is tightly bound at the head of the syringe between the stones, and then it is injected.  This is an image of the circular bladder and the holes:
The method of injection is to fill the pouch or bladder with warmed medicine, as much as the patient can bear, but beware of it being too hot or too cold. Then the patient lies on his back and raises his legs.
A cloth or blanket is placed beneath him. Then the end of the syringe is lubricated with oil, egg white, fenugreek saliva, or something similar, and gently inserted into the rectum. Then the attendant takes the bladder in both hands and squeezes it forcefully until everything in the syringe has emptied into the bowel.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs against the wall. If the medicine stimulates evacuation, he should restrain himself as much as possible; if he sleeps the whole night with it, it will be more beneficial.  If it is injected for diarrhea and evacuation is hastened, repeat the injection until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, the syringe should be very soft and smooth, smoother than those used to inject children. This is an image of a soft syringe with its skin stretched over it:
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the treatment of wounds.
I mentioned in the classification the treatment of what resembles cauterization, and I will now describe its treatment by hand and by medication completely. I say that wounds differ according to the instrument causing the wound and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The instruments that cause wounds are numerous, such as a blow from a stone, a cut from a sword or knife, a stab from a spear or stick or arrow, and so on from many things.
As for wounds according to their location on the body, there are wounds that occur on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and other organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measure and standard for all other wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds, especially because complex ones will be mentioned at the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
So I say that when a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone, I look; if it is from a blow from a stone or the like, and it has only torn the skin, and the wound is large, and I fear for the patient the occurrence of hot inflammation, then I hasten and open the temporal vein appropriately. And do not delay that, and let blood be drawn from him according to his strength, if nothing prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood coming from the wound is little, and let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the injured area.
And warn the patient against fullness, drinks, and heavy foods; if something prevents him from bloodletting, let him reduce food and not approach meats or drinks.  And apply to the wound, if hot inflammation occurs in it, cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with an astringent drink.
And if you are safe from hot inflammation, apply to the wound, if it is fresh and the air has not altered it—the unguent which I will describe to you shortly—but if the air has altered it, apply some ointments to it.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and is from a sword cut or the like, and its edges do not come together by themselves, then join it by suturing, as I describe in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin exposes the bone and hangs, and its attachment is only by a small ligament, cut it, then treat the wound with medicines that produce firm flesh in place of the skin, and order the patient to eat foods that have firmness, such as heads and brains and the like.
If decay occurs in the skin and does not adhere to the bone, cut away all the decayed part and throw it away, then treat it. If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding and the bleeding does not stop with medication, then search for the artery.
If you find it and it is not severed, sever it with the scalpel and tie it. If necessary, if what we have mentioned is not effective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, their treatment is easy; it suffices to treat them by sprinkling this unguent on them while they are still bleeding.
Before the air changes them.  The preparation of the unguent is that one part of frankincense, two parts of mastic, and three parts of slaked or unslaked lime are taken.  All are ground, sifted, and the wound is packed with it and bound tightly until it adheres well.
It coagulates with the blood, then bind it from above with bandages and leave it; do not unbind it as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not separate from it until it heals. The lime alone may do this if you do not have frankincense and mastic.
This action may also be done with alum in many large wounds if its application and binding are properly done, and the wounds are fresh and bleeding, before the air changes them, but if the air has changed them somewhat, especially in summer.
Then there is no point in applying this unguent; treat it with what we mentioned: apply some ripening ointments or apply a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey until the pus is drawn out, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
But if a fracture of the bone occurs with the wound and it is slight, then reduce it with traction.  I have described the treatment of head fractures in what follows, in the surgery of the neck. If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a head wound if it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy other than to avoid treating it with things that cause strong constriction, such as verdigris and vitriol and the like, because these harm the nerve and cause it to spasm.
Nor should anything cold whatsoever be placed on the wound because the substance of the nerve is cold and its connection is to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  Treat it with soft medicines such as washed nutria with fresh water many times, moistened with oil or rose ointment and tutty.
If also washed with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner and moist ointments. But if the wound is large, use sutures or bind its edges with compresses, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has depth and a pocket forms in its lower part where pus collects, open it in its lowest place. If an artery has been severed in the wound and you see its blood flowing, ligate it or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx and the trachea is intact, join the edges of the skin with sutures over the windpipe, but do not touch the windpipe; rather smooth it and return it to its natural shape, then tightly bind it and leave it for some days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, examine it; if there are bone splinters, extract all of them or as many as you can; what you cannot reach, leave until the wound suppurates and heals and it is easy to remove them.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle upon it the powder we described. If a bone becomes infected in the wound and it becomes fistulous, treat it with what will be mentioned in its chapter, in the surgery of the chest and between the shoulders.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife and you see that it has depth, look: if air comes out of it when the patient breathes, know that it is a mortal wound. If it does not have depth and is fresh with its blood, do not at first put powder in it, nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be retained in its depth.
It will then recede to the heart and kill the patient.  But put in it an attractive ointment and dress it twice a day. If you do not have ointment, put old cotton in the mouth of the wound to absorb the moisture that comes from it, and have the patient sleep on the wound.
so that what collects in it will flow out. And if three days or more have passed since the wounding, and the patient has not developed convulsions, a bad pulse, or shortness of breath, and you see that his other conditions are good, know that the wound is healthy, so treat it with cauterization and other treatments until it heals.
If its sight is difficult and the pus flows constantly, know that it has become fistulous, and treat it in its chapter. The patient lies on the wound so that what collects in it may flow out. If the wound is in the chest or back, treat it with the preceding stitching.
If it is large, use powder; if it is small, use cauterization. If it has affected the bone and broken off splinters, explore the wound and proceed to remove those splinters if they are clean. If they are not clean, leave them until…
the wound becomes septic, for then it is easy to remove them.  As for other wounds occurring in other members, their treatment follows the rule of what we have mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-five.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, the protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.
The wound which occurs in the abdomen may be large, or it may be small or medium.  A large wound may allow the protrusion of an intestine or several intestines, and returning them and suturing will be more difficult and arduous.
A small wound may also be difficult in another respect; returning the intestine may be more difficult, and if the intestine is not immediately returned to its place, it swells and thickens, making its return difficult. For this reason, a medium-sized wound is preferable, because returning the intestine is not as difficult with it as with these two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen is of four kinds: two are general, suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing other wounds of the body; the other two are specific, used in other wounds, but they are more particularly suited to the suturing of the abdomen.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification. I say that if the wound is small and some of the intestine protrudes and its return is difficult, this is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we said, or because the intestine has been swollen by the cold air.
If this is the case, then it should be warmed by dipping a sponge or wet cloth in lukewarm water alone, or in water in which anise, rue, and wheat have been boiled, and applying it to the intestine until the swelling resolves.
A styptic drink may also do this, and it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling. When you see that the swelling has resolved, moisten the intestine with water in which comfrey or mallow has been boiled, for this will make its return easier.
If its return is still difficult after this treatment, then make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used to incise fistulas. The first treatment, if successful, is better than incision. Incision is only resorted to after necessity and failure of other methods. This is an image of the instrument:
One side of it is curved and pointed, the other side is not pointed. The thin end should not be as sharp as a scalpel, but slightly blunt. It is an instrument resembling a small forceps, as you see.  If the wound widens and the intestine enters, then it should be returned to its natural shape.
And its proper place, if you can manage it, is best. But if the wound is large and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back with his legs raised higher than his head; if it is in the upper abdomen, his head and chest should be raised higher than his lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always keep the side with the injury higher than the other. This should be done in large and medium-sized wounds.
As for small wounds, position him as you are able. Then have a skilled assistant ready, who holds the entire wound with both hands, bringing its edges together, then revealing it bit by bit to the one who is stitching.
This is the description of a single common stitch: take one needle, or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Then leave a space from the edge of the wound equal to the thickness of the little finger, and insert a single needle without thread into the edges of the skin. along with the edges of the peritoneum under the skin from the inside, until you pass it through from that side.  You have now brought together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, forming four layers. Then, tighten with a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound are firmly joined.
Then leave a space equal to the thickness of a finger, and insert another needle, then connect it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with as many needles as needed until you complete the entire circumference of the wound. Let the needles be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
Because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin; therefore, they should be of medium thickness.  And the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too close to the wound.
lest the flesh quickly tear and the wound open before it heals.  Do not space the stitches too far apart either, lest the wound fail to unite. Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient when he sleeps, and make him pads of linen cloth on each side to hold the ends of the needles.
And leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of stitching with needles is best suited for small wounds, because one or two needles, or so, may suffice for stitching them.
As for the method of stitching for the common [wound], it is to gather with the stitching the four edges—that is, the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum—at once with a needle threaded with a twisted thread of moderate thickness, then when you have passed the needle through these four edges, return the needle to the same side from which you began.
So that the thread lies interwoven from the top of the wound, so that the stitching is like the stitching of a purse with which belongings are tied. And make the space between each stitch the width of a little finger. This stitching is known to all people.
With this stitching, a wound was stitched for a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded with a knife. The wound was more than a span long, and about two spans of the midgut had protruded. And the wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
And I replaced it after its gut had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.  The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered, and he lived many years thereafter, managing all his affairs. And the physicians had judged that he would never recover.
And it is remarkable that I did not treat him with an ointment, because I was in a place where there were no medicines.  So I applied worn cotton to the wound twice a day and would treat it by washing with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two types of special stitching, I mention it according to Galen's words:  Begin the stitching from the skin, and insert the needle from outside to inside. Then, when the needle has penetrated the skin and the muscle going straight along the whole length of the abdomen...
...leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle, and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, into the other edge of the peritoneum. Then, when you have passed it through, pass it again through this same edge of the peritoneum from outside to inside.
And leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside.  And as you pass it through, pass it into the edge of the peritoneum on its side, until it penetrates it completely.
Then begin again from this same side, and sew it together with the edge of the peritoneum on the other side. Bring the needle out of the skin nearby, then return it into that skin and sew the edge of the peritoneum on the other side together with this edge of the peritoneum.
Bring it out through the skin on its side. Do this again and again, one time after another, until you have sewn up the whole wound in this way. The complete description of this stitching is that it is sewn like the stitching of furriers for fur.
That you sew the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leave it once from the other side, until you are finished. As for the second type of special stitching, which Galen also mentioned, his words are literally:
It is that you sew it in the manner that some healers sew, by joining each part to its counterpart, naturally similar to it, so that they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the intestine to its other edge.  This is as I describe to you.
You should insert the needle into the edge of the intestine nearest you from the outside, and pass it to the inside in it alone, and leave the edges of the peritoneum. Then return the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside in both edges of the peritoneum. Then return it again.
And pass it from the inside to the outside in the edge of the other intestine, which is on the opposite side. This type of stitching is better than the easy, general stitching, which is the stitching previously mentioned. These are Galen's exact words. Some have said that the stitching of the abdomen may be done with two needles. That is, you insert one thread into them, and begin by inserting the needle from your side and passing it to the other side, and insert the other needle from the opposite side, then pass it from your side, according to the stitching of the saddlebags.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, then its stitching is more difficult than in other places of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its ruling in its treatment is the ruling of all other wounds. That is, if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and you return the intestine and stitch it and make it tight, then apply to it the styptic powder.
If the wound has been changed by the air, then apply to it some of the ointments that you prepare until it suppurates and the stitches fall out, and the peritoneum and intestine unite. Then treat it as you treat all other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, then apply to it, from the time it begins to suppurate, old cotton, and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals. For you do not need further treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple. If you fear that the wound will involve the principal organs in pain,
Then it is necessary that you dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and the armpit. If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestine—and that often happens—then inject him with lukewarm black astringent syrup.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and become a penetrating wound into its cavity. And know that what is thick of the intestines is easier to heal, and what is thin of them is more difficult to heal.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from a wound that befalls it at all, because of the multitude of its veins and their size, and the thinness of its substance, and its proximity to the nature of the nerve.  But if what emerged from the wound is the mesentery, and you find it moist, then return it in the same way as you would return the intestine.
If a period of time has passed and it has turned green or black, then it is necessary that you tie it with a thread above the place which has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for there are veins and arteries in the mesentery, then cut below that ligature.
And leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, emerging from it, so that it is easy for you to pull and remove it when the mesentery falls off and the wound suppurates.  [He] mentioned the wound which occurs in the intestine.  But if a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small,
it is possible that it may heal in some people, because I saw a man who had been wounded in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and the wound became chronic and became a fistula from which feces and wind emerged, so I treated him though I did not hope for his healing. I continued to treat him gently until it healed and the place rejoined. When I saw the place had rejoined, I feared for the patient that a bad incident might occur in his abdomen, but no bad incident occurred to him at all, and he remained in the best of health. He eats and drinks properly, and engages in sexual intercourse, and enters the bathhouse, and participates in his service.  Some experienced people have mentioned that whenever a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be sutured in this manner.
And that is to take large-headed ants, then bring the edges of the wound together, then place one of them, with its mouth open, on the edges of the wound; and when it has grasped and tightened its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere and not become undone. Then place another ant near the first.
And you continue to do that with several ants according to the size of the wound, then you return it and suture the wound, for those heads remain stuck in the intestine until the intestine heals and recovers, and no harm at all occurs to the patient.  It is also possible to suture the intestine with fine thread.
That which is drawn out from the intestine of the animal adhering to it after it is inserted into a needle is that a strand of this thread from the intestine is taken, gently drawn out, then a thin, twisted linen thread is tied to its end, and that thread is then inserted into the needle. And in it is the intestinal thread, with which the intestine is sutured, then returned to the abdomen. This type of suturing with ants and intestine is only by way of hope and expectation.
But if the perforation is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no remedy and no healing at all.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
In the treatment of catarrh and fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and longstanding and becomes an ulcer and does not heal, and constantly discharges pus that does not cease, is called in general, in whatever organ it may be, a fistula, and we call it a catarrh, and a fistula.
It is in reality a hardened, matted, white mass, with no pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather.  And it is sometimes moist, constantly discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture may cease.  This moisture may be abundant or scanty, thick or thin.
And I have already stated in the classification, when mentioning wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal and in which flesh does not grow, is so because of one of nine reasons: one of which is either because of a deficiency of blood in the body, or because of its poor quality, or because inside it and on its edges there is hard flesh which prevents the growth of good flesh. Or because it is very foul and dirty; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter it discharges is of poor quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment; or because of a general epidemic corruption in the region; or because of a specific quality in the region.
Or because it is very foul and dirty; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter it discharges is of poor quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment; or because of a general epidemic corruption in the region; or because of a specific quality in the region. As was shown in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is naturally slow; or because there is one bone or several bones in it.  I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the classification.
Here it is necessary for me to acquaint you with the treatment of fistulas and abscesses which is done by means of the hand. Know that fistulas may occur in all the members of the body; some of them end in large veins and arteries, or in a nerve.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib of the ribs, or to a vertebra of the vertebrae of the back, or to a joint of the compound joints, such as the hand and the foot; and some of them lead to the vicinity of a principal organ, and so on.
Now, those fistulas which are of this kind are among the difficult-to-cure diseases which do not tolerate treatment and the occupation with them is troublesome and ignorant; but if there are fistulas which do not reach these places which I have mentioned, and I have hoped for and expected their treatment,
and you wish to arrive at the knowledge of that, then take a probe of brass or iron; if the fistula runs straight, then explore it with it; but if there is a winding in the fistula, explore it with a probe of thin lead, because lead is soft in its body.
Then it will become smooth at the entrance and bend towards the winding.  If the fistula has many openings which you cannot discover with the probe, inject one of its openings; for the moisture which you inject into it will pass towards the other openings and flow out.
Then thoroughly investigate in whichever way you can, to find out whether there is bone or nerve, or whether the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or whether it is a single fistula with many openings.  Establish all this to the extent of your ability by examining the patient and his feeling of pain when you touch the place.
And in the same way from the signs and causes occurring in the swelling.  If you have established all this truthfully, then proceed to treatment with confidence; it is that you should see whether, if it is...
the fistula is apparent and near, or in a safe place far from a joint or nerve or artery or vein or one of the places I mentioned to you, then incise the fistula as I have described above and remove what is in it of the clot and the corrupted flesh and the excess flesh.
And whatever grows in its opening of flesh or wart and the like, and treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep-seated and straight, then you should incise it deeply as much as you can, then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Then use a twisted tent of strong medications and insert it to the bottom of the fistula which you can reach with an instrument; do this repeatedly until that strong medication eats away all that remains in the bottom of the fistula of corruption.
Then treat it with ointments which cause healthy flesh to grow until it heals. If it does not heal with that, cauterize it as described above. If the cause of the fistula is bone and this is certain to you, then investigate it and incise it as I have told you, if nothing prevents you.
a nerve or a main organ as we said, then if the bone is revealed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with what will heal it until it heals. If it does not heal and the pus continues as it was doing,
know that you have not reached the complete removal of the corruption; expose all of it again and completely scrape and cleanse it with the utmost effort, then treat it. If it heals, otherwise know that that corruption is in a deep recess; expose all of it again.
and completely scrape and cleanse it with the utmost effort. If the corrupted bone is small and you can pull it out, then pull it out with delicate forceps suitable for that.
If there are many bones, completely remove them all and do not leave any of them; exert your utmost effort. If something of the ligaments obstructs you and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and the flesh if it is there, and remove the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones at once, then apply to the wound something that will cause it to decay, and leave it for some days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones decay.  Keep the wound from closing; the incision you made during your work.
Rather, if you fear that, place on it cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or one of the green ointments; for when they cause those ligaments to decay and the bones to loosen, it will be easy to remove and pull them out.
If it is a single large bone, like a bone of the leg or thigh, and so on, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption disappear, then dress the wound. If a large part of it is corrupted, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it must be opened.
And cut it all away to where the corruption ends; then treat it until it heals. And I tell you of a gangrene that occurred in a man's leg, to make it an example and aid to your treatment; this man was young.
About thirty years old; a pain occurred in his leg, from a cause moving within his body until the humors reached the leg and it swelled with a great swelling; there was no external cause. Then time passed with the mistakes of the physicians until the swelling opened.
And much matter flowed from it, and he was treated badly until the leg became gangrenous and many openings appeared in it, all discharging pus and the humors of the body. A group of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was not among them one skilled in surgery.
Until they sought me out. I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those openings in great abundance, and the man was emaciated and his color yellow. Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
And I found them leading to one another from all sides of the leg. So I began and incised one of those openings until I uncovered some of the bone, and I found it corrupted, eaten away, black, putrid, and perforated until the perforation reached the marrow.  Then I excised what was revealed to me.
And I removed the corrupted bone, and I thought that there was no corruption in the bone other than what I had cut and excised, and that I had eradicated it. Then I proceeded to dress the wound with agglutinative medicines for a long time, but it did not heal. Then I returned and uncovered the bone again, beyond the first uncovering.
And I found the corruption continuous with the bone. So I excised what was also revealed to me of that corruption. Then I attempted to dress it, but it did not heal nor unite. Then I uncovered it again, and I continued to cut the bone piece by piece and attempt to heal it, but it would not heal, until I had cut away about a span of bone.
And I removed it with its marrow. Then I dressed it with medicines, and it healed quickly and completely.  This repetition in its operation and incision was necessary because of the weakness of the patient and his low tolerance, and my fear for his death, because he suffered from excessive vomiting and fainting at all times. He recovered completely.
And in the place of the bone grew firm flesh, and his condition in his body was improved, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs, and in his walking he was not afflicted by anything whatsoever. If a projecting bone in a part of the body is broken…
Then it should be excised in this manner: you take a ligature and tie it around the end of the projecting bone, and you instruct someone to pull it upwards, and you make another ligature of thicker wool than the first ligature.
Then you tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards, and you expose the flesh from the place which you wish to excise, lest the saw injure the flesh, and you place a piece of wood or a board firmly beneath the bone from below.
Because if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupted bone.  The sawing should be slightly above the location of the corruption, lest there be corruption in the cavity of the bone which does not appear on its surface to the touch, thus necessitating sawing it again.
If the bone is corrupted and is not projecting, but its parts are connected to one another, and the corruption is in its middle or in some part of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides completely, then place the wood from below, then saw from the first side where the corruption is.
When you have finished sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little distance from the corruption, as we said. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no recourse but excision. If the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or the metacarpus of the foot, the matter of its treatment is very difficult, but you should peel off the corruption however it appears to you, and excise it and clean it in whatever way you can.
And by whatever method it is straightened for you, provided that a vein or nerve does not obstruct you. And know that the saws and the instruments for cutting these bones are numerous, according to the position of the bones, their setting, their thickness and thinness, their size and smallness, their hardness and looseness. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare for each type of work an instrument similar to that work.
And know that the works themselves may indicate to you the type of instrument that you need, if you have long practice and knowledge of the arts of this craft, because it is from the skill of the craft and witnessing many types of diseases. He may devise for himself instruments similar to those for each disease, and I am depicting for you at the end of this chapter several instruments.
Make them examples to be imitated and a measure by which you measure others, God willing.  Image of a saw:

In cutting off limbs and sawing bones.
Limbs may become putrid, either from an external cause or from an internal cause. If you treat this corruption with medicinal treatment and the treatment is not effective, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing restraining it,
then it is necessary to cut off that limb to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may escape death or a great affliction which is greater than the loss of the limb.  A sign of this occurring is that the limb blackens, until you think that fire has burnt it.
Or it may become putrid after the blackening, until that putridity spreads to what is next to that limb and takes hold in the body as a whole. Therefore, hasten to cut it off.  Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of some creature, such as a sea scorpion, a snake, a tarantula, or the like.
If the corruption or sting is in the tip of a finger, cut off the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.  Similarly, if it has taken hold in the hand, cut it off from the origin of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it takes hold in the forearm.
Similarly, if it has taken hold in the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow in the joint itself. If the corruption spreads and you see it taking hold towards the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient; rather use other treatments as much as possible.
And similarly you do with the leg: if the corruption takes hold in a toe, cut off the toe at one of the joints; and if it takes hold in the metatarsus, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends to the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no recourse but to leave it and leave the patient to death. The method of cutting off or dissecting a limb is to tie a ligature below the place you wish to cut and tie another ligature above the place.
And one assistant pulls the lower ligature downwards, and another assistant pulls the upper ligature upwards, and you yourself expose the flesh between the ligatures with a wide scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then it is cut or dissected; and it is necessary that you place linen cloths on all sides.
Lest the saw touch the healthy tissue and cause the patient excessive pain and hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, staunch the place quickly or apply some styptic powder, then return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. And I tell you of an example of a man who experienced this very condition in his leg, that is, blackness with burning like fire appeared in his leg.
And that corruption first appeared in his toe until it consumed the whole leg.  Then the man himself, seeing the corruption spreading in the limb along with the intense pain and burning, cut it off at the joint and recovered.
Then, after a long time, that same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand.  He came to me, and I tried to stop that corruption with the medications I applied to his hand after cleansing his body. But the corruption did not stop and began to spread to another finger.
Until the corruption consumed his hand, and he asked me to amputate it. But I refused, hoping to stop the corruption, and I also feared for his life if I amputated his hand because the man was very weak. When he despaired of me, he returned to his town.
Then I heard that he himself cut off his entire hand and recovered.  I have recounted this story to be helpful in cases of this kind of disease and to serve as a guide to be followed.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
On the treatment of fistulas and how to inject them with medication.
If a swelling occurs in one of the fleshy organs and the duration of the swelling is prolonged until it gathers pus, then it bursts or is lanced and all the pus inside comes out, and the place is left empty like a vessel.
And the skin over it is like a thin rag, not so severely damaged as to affect the bone, nerve, or ligament.  Therefore it deserves to be called a fistula, and not a sinus, unless its duration is prolonged until the damage affects one of these organs.
Then it is called a sinus or a fistula, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin completely, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere and the corruption has not reached that point, and there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with injection. This is done by examining the fistula; if it is large and the pus that flows from it is foul-smelling, then inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris in equal parts, gathered in a vessel and cooked over a fire until the medicine thickens and reaches the consistency of honey. Then take what you need and thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the fistula, and bind its mouth, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then remove it by pressing; do this for several days until the fistula is cleansed and the foul smell is gone.  You may inject it with ash water if this medicine is not available to you.  This is made by taking the ash of grapevine wood or oak wood and pouring water over it.
Then filter it and inject it until you are certain that the fistula has been cleansed. If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then inject it with water and honey in which some powdered verdigris has been mixed.
Or inject it with honey and syrup mixed together, for honey cleanses and washes, and syrup adheres to the fistula, especially if the syrup has a binding and drying property.  When you have done this several times and are certain that the corruption of the fistula has gone, then inject it with something that will grow flesh in it.
Such as taking some palm ointment and dissolving it in rose oil and an astringent syrup, or inject it with some of the other medicines and ointments whose descriptions we have given in the chapter on ointments. If the opening of the fistula is narrow and does not admit the injection tube,
widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place in it a pledget soaked in Egyptian ointment or theriac ointment until it widens. Similarly, if the opening is wide, bring its edges together with stitches, leaving only enough space to insert the injection tube.
Similarly, if the opening from which the pus flows is high up, incise it in the lowest point so that the pus may flow downwards, for if the pus is retained in the depth of the fistula it prevents the growth of flesh there.
If you cannot incise the fistula downwards as desired, then raise the limb so that the pus may flow easily, as seems best to you, so that nothing of the pus remains at all.
As for the cataplasms which are applied externally to the fistula and the manner of their application, take one of the suitable cataplasms and spread it on a linen cloth, the cloth being large enough to cover the whole fistula. Then cut with scissors opposite the opening of the fistula a hole slightly larger than the opening of the fistula; then spread some soft ointment on another cloth, to the size of the hole, and place it there, spaced away from the opening of the fistula, so that the pus may easily exit, and do not remove the larger cloth until afterwards.
several days; but that which is on the opening of the fistula, you remove at all times so that what has gathered there of pus may come out, and you may know what flows from it of pus: whether it is much or little, mature or immature.
And with this also, examine the site of the fistula itself: does its owner feel pain in it or not, and is there swelling in it or not?  If your treatment continues thus, and you see the matter which comes out is little at the opening of the fistula,
know that the fistula has adhered or is nearing adhesion; then at that time resolve it on the morrow or on the third day. And when you have opened the wound, change the cloths to others and renew the ointment. If, after a long time, thin pus comes out of the fistula, do not despair of its healing.
Its healing is near, for some people are slow in the growth of flesh in their wounds, and others the opposite. If, after many days, immature pus comes out of the fistula, know that the fistula has not healed. If the healing of the fistula is slow,
and its matter is prolonged, increase the drying medicines, and let them be medicines that are moist in their consistency and dry in their strength, like the palm ointment if an excess of litharge has been added to it. And one of the most effective things to treat it with is that the palm ointment is taken,
and it is dissolved with rose oil and sprinkled upon it with old wine moderate in its consistency, then knead it with it and use it.  He may do a similar action if the palm ointment is not available to you: honey, if you cook it until it thickens and use it; or you may take myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, crush them all together, and sprinkle them onto the honey while it is on the fire. Then spread it on a cloth and bind it to the fistula; or it may be spread with the honey which you have cooked until it thickens, and sprinkle the drugs on it, and place the cloth on it and bind it.
Long zedoary, the root of the asphodel, the powder of costus, and centaury may be used in such a case, singly if you use them, or in a mixture: crush and sieve them and sprinkle them on the honey as described and use it. If the matter of the fistula is prolonged and it does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth.
And if it has affected the bones, or the other hard nerves, or the ligaments, treat it as a fistula, as has been explained above.
Chapter eighty-nine.
On the treatment of the felon, the injured nail, the excision of the superfluous finger, and the separation of adherent fingers.
A felon is a fleshy growth that develops under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and it may also develop in the other fingers. If its condition is prolonged and its treatment is neglected, it swells into a hot tumor.
Or it becomes corrupted and putrid until it eats away the root of the nail, and perhaps destroys it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, so that it has a foul odor, and the tip of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes livid. If you treat it with what we have mentioned in the division, and your treatment is not effective,
it is necessary to cut off with an iron instrument all the superfluous growth that grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards; for cauterization is very beneficial in this case.  And if the bone is sound and the nail is also sound,
and the corner containing the nail has pinched the flesh inwards and is causing it to be lacerated and injured, it is necessary to place a thin pledget under the corner of the nail which lacerates the flesh, and raise it upwards and cut that flesh gently.
And you should apply to what remains of the flesh some of the cauterizing, corrosive drugs until it is all gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals.  And if the corruption has affected the bone, it is necessary to cut away that bone and remove it, for it will not heal at all as long as there is corrupted bone in it.
If you see that the corrosion and corruption is spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of the joints as mentioned before, then treat it until it heals. If the nail receives a blow or a bruise and severe pain occurs in it, it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Then you incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, making an oblique incision from above downwards, and be careful not to reach with the incision the flesh which is under the nail; for by so doing you would cause the patient severe pain and it would be a cause of the growth of superfluous flesh in the place. Then treat the place with what alleviates pain.
As for the superfluous finger which grows in some people's hands, perhaps it is entirely fleshy, and perhaps it contains bones in some part, and perhaps it has a nail, and the growth of some of them is at the root of the joint of some fingers.
Or its growth may be in some of the joints of the finger. Those which grow in some of the joints of the finger do not move, and those which grow at the joint of the finger may move.  As for that which is only fleshy, its cutting is easy; that is to cut it at its base with a broad scalpel.
As for that whose growth is at the root of the joint, its treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting it. As for that which grows in the finger at one of the joints, it is necessary to first cut its flesh in a circular cut down to the bone, then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the adhesion which occurs between the fingers, this often occurs, and it is something with which a person is born, or which happens from the healing of a wound or a burn by fire or the like. It is necessary to incise that adhesion.
until the fingers return to their natural form. Then place between them a pledget or a piece of lint soaked in rose oil, lest it quickly adhere. Separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until the place heals as it should.
Similarly, if adhesion occurs between some of the fingers and the palm, incise that adhesion according to what is suitable and improves the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On the excision of polyps.
Polyps are thick, twisted, varicose veins, dark in color, which occur in most parts of the body, most frequently in the legs, especially in the legs of those who carry burdens and those who work with their hands.  First, one should apply vigorous rubbing of the body with black hellebore.
Then bleed the patient from the basilic vein. As for treating them with iron, there are two ways: one is to incise and remove the black blood; the other is to extract the vein entirely.  As for incision, the leg should first be bathed in warm water.
until the thick, turbid blood becomes liquefied. Then the patient's leg is bound from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage, and the vein is incised in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then you extract the black blood with your hand from below the leg upwards and from above downwards, until you have removed the amount you deem sufficient, or what the patient's strength can bear. Then you bind it and tell him to avoid foods which produce black bile; and repeat the purging and bloodletting.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient. As for extracting it completely, this is how it is done: shave the patient's leg if there is much hair; then take him to the bathhouse and bathe his leg in hot water until it turns red and sweats, or until he performs vigorous exercise.
If a bathhouse is not available, until the limb is warmed, then you incise the skin along the vein lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or at its lower end near the heel; then open the skin with hooks and peel away the vein from every side until it is palpable.
And when it appears, you will see it is dark red; and when it is freed from the skin, you will see it also like a tendon. Then insert a probe beneath it until, when it is raised and emerges from the skin, you hang it on a smooth, blunt hook, then make another incision near that incision by the amount of three fingers.
Then peel the skin from over the vein until it appears, then raise it with the probe as you did before and hang it on another hook as you did initially; then make another incision, or many incisions, if you need to.
Then extract it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull it and extract it until it comes out of the second incision; then pull it to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it from the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, until when it has all emerged, you cut it.
If it does not respond to pulling and extraction, then insert a needle with strong doubled thread, and tie it and pull it, and insert the probe underneath and twist it with your hand to every side until it emerges; and take care that it does not break, for if it breaks, then its extraction will be very difficult for you.
And harm will come to the patient from it.  When you have extracted it completely, place on the site of the incisions wool soaked in a syrup and rose oil or olive oil, and treat it until it heals. If the varicose vein is tense, with convolutions and twisting in various directions…
and it is not straight as we said, then it is necessary that you make an incision on it at each part of its convolutions and places of twisting, then hang it on hooks until you extract it entirely; and be careful when incising it that you do not cut or injure the vein, for that will make its extraction difficult for you, so take care.
Image of the incision used to incise the varicose vein.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not be hooked like other hooks, nor should it be sharp-pointed, lest it injure the vein; and it should be thick, smoothly curved, for if it is thin it will cut the vein with its thinness; rather it should have a considerable thickness, as we said.
Chapter ninety-one.
On the treatment of varicose veins.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot countries like the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs, and in hot, arid lands with little fertility; and it may be generated in other places in the body besides the legs, and its generation is due to an infection that occurs under the skin.
Just as living creatures and worms occur inside the bodies, and the swelling of gourds and worms generated between the skin and flesh, the sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the place suppurates, and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that suppuration.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal, so when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one to two dirhams, and tied, and the lead is left hanging from the leg.
So every time something emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in the lead and tie it.  If it becomes very long, cut some of it and wrap the remainder; but do not cut it from its root before it all emerges, because if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing a swelling, infection in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be treated carefully and pulled out little by little until it emerges completely and nothing of it remains in the body.  From this vein, in some people, what emerges can be five to ten cubits long.
And it has reached me that from a man twenty cubits emerged. If it breaks for you while you are treating it, then insert a probe into its hole and cauterize it deeply with the body until all that is in it of matter is emptied, and try to treat the infection with medicines for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment of tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or in the leg itself, causing many openings, and from each opening a branch emerges. Treat it as we mentioned in the classification and what preceded.
Chapter ninety-two.
Concerning the incision for the worm that develops under the armpit and is called the cow's disease.
This disease is called in some of our countries the cow's disease, because it often affects cows. It is a single small worm that develops between the skin and flesh, and moves in the whole body, ascending and descending.
It is perceived by touch as it moves from one member to another, until it breaks through the skin wherever it breaks through, and emerges.  Its formation is from the corruption of some humors, as happens with worms, snakes, and gourd-like swellings in the abdomen.
Its harm is expected to be that if it moves in the body and ascends to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it and emerge, thus destroying the eye. This happens frequently. If you wish to treat it and remove it, this is done only when it moves and becomes perceptible to the touch.
It is necessary to tightly bind above and below it with a strong ligature, then incise over it and remove it. If it has sunk into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply cautery with fire to the area until you burn it. The greatest harm to be expected from it is, as we said, its damage to the eye.
If you see that it has reached the head near the eye, then bind tightly below it on the forehead, then incise over it and remove it. The patient should be treated by purifying his body with purgative medicines for bad, corrupt humors, and should abstain from foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
Concerning the incision for the disease known as the *nafir*.
This disease, which in our country is called *nafir*, is a pain that appears in some members and then moves from one member to another. I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in the countryside. She uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the forearm. After a short while, I saw that swelling move along the ulna like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
Then, as it moved from place to place, the pain left that place and settled in the shoulder.  Then I waited a while, and it ran throughout the body until it was in the other arm. Then she told me that it circulates throughout her whole body, as I witnessed.
I was amazed at the speed of its movement from one member to another. I had never before seen this disease with my own eyes in this manner, except that I had seen several people whose pain moved from one member to another. However, I had not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.
And I judged this to be only because the woman was from the countryside, with a dry body and visible veins; therefore, that moving wind was apparent to the senses. It would not appear in this way in those of comfortable circumstances, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it, and the patient feels pain, and if it appears to you visibly as we mentioned, then bind above and below it tightly, and incise it until that congested wind comes out, and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by means of things that dispel the body's humors and disperse the winds, such as the seeds of rue and the seeds of spikenard, and similar medicines.
Chapter ninety-four.
On extracting arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the places in the body where they are located. As for their differences according to their types, there are large ones and small ones, hollow glass ones and solid glass ones, and some have three points and some four.
Some have barbs and some have splinters. As for those according to the organs in which they are located, they are of two kinds: either the organs are hollow principal organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and so on. If an arrow is lodged in one of these organs and you see the signs of death which I shall describe to you later, then you should avoid extracting that arrow from it, for in most cases death will overtake the patient. But if these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has not disappeared into the depth of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  Among the signs of an arrow reaching the brain and penetrating the bone and wounding the membrane covering the brain are severe headache, dizziness, and stupor.
But if these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has not disappeared into the depth of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  Among the signs of an arrow reaching the brain and penetrating the bone and wounding the membrane covering the brain are severe headache, dizziness, and stupor. And redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, convulsions, mental confusion, vomiting, and sometimes blood comes from the nostrils or ears; sometimes speech is lost and the voice is gone, and a white moisture resembling gruel comes from the wound, and a watery substance like flesh flows from it.
If these signs appear, abstain from treating the patient and from removing the arrow if it has not already been removed.  As for the signs if the arrow reaches the heart and is near the left breast, you will feel as if it has been driven into something solid, not into something empty.
And perhaps the arrow will have a movement resembling the pulse, and black blood will flow from the wound, followed by coldness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting. Know then that death is inevitable.  A sign that the arrow has wounded the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels near the neck swell, the patient's color changes, he breathes heavily, and seeks to inhale cold air. If the arrow reaches the diaphragm in the chest, it will be near the lower ribs, and breathing will be labored with severe pain.
He will sigh and all the muscles of the shoulders will move. If the arrow reaches the liver, severe pain will follow, and blood resembling the liver in redness will come from the wound. If the arrow reaches the stomach, something undigested from the food may come from the wound.
His condition is clear. If the arrow reaches the abdomen and becomes embedded there, and something from the stool, fat, or intestine which has been perforated comes from the wound, there is no hope for treatment or for removing the arrow. If the arrow reaches the bladder and urine comes out.
and something protrudes from it outwardly and the pain intensifies for the patient, know that he is doomed. As for the other organs, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, vertebrae of the back, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are mostly spared.
When the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve and the arrow is not poisoned. And I will tell you some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may thereby deduce your treatment. That is that an arrow once struck a man in the corner of his eye at the root of the nose.
I removed it for him from the other side under the lobe of the ear and he recovered, and no harm befell his eye. And I removed another arrow for a Jew which had struck him in the lobe of his eye under the lower eyelid; and the arrow had disappeared, and I only reached the small end which is attached to the wood.
It was a large arrow from the composite bows, square-headed, smooth, without barbs.  The Jew recovered, and no ill befell his eye. And I removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian; and the arrow was an Arab arrow.
and it is the one with two barbs; so I made an incision between his jugular veins, and it had sunk into his throat. So I gently worked it out until I extracted it.  The Christian recovered and was healed. And I removed another arrow for a man which had struck him in the abdomen, and we judged that he would die from it.
But when thirty days or so had passed, and nothing in his condition had changed, I made an incision over the arrow and maneuvered it and extracted it, and he recovered and no ill befell him. And I saw a man struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound had closed over it.
Then after seven years the arrow emerged at the root of her thigh. And I saw a woman who had been struck in her abdomen by an arrow, and the wound had closed, and the arrow remained; and nothing in her condition changed, nor did she find any harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man struck by an arrow in his face, and the wound closed, and he felt little pain from it. And there are many such cases. And I removed an arrow for a man from the Sultan's guard which had struck him in the middle of his nose, inclining slightly to the right side.
And the entire arrow was hidden. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck. I found the arrow wound very narrow, so I explored it with a thin probe, but I did not feel it. And he felt a stinging pain under his ear on the right side of the incision.
I hoped that this stinging pain was from the tip of the arrow, so I applied a dressing with drawing and ripening power, hoping that the area would swell and the arrow's location would be revealed so that I could incise it. But nothing happened in the area to indicate that the arrow had reached that place.
So I continued the dressing for many days, but nothing happened. Then the wound closed, and the patient despaired of its removal for a time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and told me.  So I applied a strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it, and I felt the thin tip of the arrow which adheres to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that strong medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared clearly to us.  And I spent about four months with him.
Then, when the wound widened and I was able to insert forceps into it, I pulled and moved it, but it did not respond to removal. So I continued to gently manipulate it and devise ways with various instruments until one day I grasped it with strong forceps, as its image is shown at the end of the chapter.
And the physicians judged that the cartilage of his nose would not heal, but I healed it, and the wound closed, and the patient recovered completely, without any further harm. And I tell you the method of removing some arrows so that you may make this a measure and a guide to what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description nor encompassed by a book.  Rather, the skillful craftsman judges from the little to the much, and from what is present to what is absent, and he deduces a new action and a new instrument in strange emergencies.
If we descend from this craft, I say that arrows are removed from the members in which they are embedded in two ways: either by pulling from the place where they entered, or from the opposite direction, and those that are removed from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy place, and it is pulled out. If it does not yield to removal from the place where it lodged, then you should leave it for a few days until the flesh around it rots, so that it is easier to pull out and remove. Likewise if it is embedded in a bone.
And if it does not yield to removal, leave it also for days and return to pulling and moving it every day, for it will come out.  If it does not yield to removal after days, then you should bore around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a delicate borer until you widen [the hole] for the arrow, then pull and remove it.
If the arrow embedded in the skull has penetrated deeply into one of the ventricles of the brain and some of those symptoms I mentioned to you appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until its condition improves after some days.
then persevere in pulling out the arrow. If it is very deeply embedded and does not yield to pulling, use the borers around the arrow as I described to you, then treat the area until it heals.  But if the arrow has disappeared into a part of the body, and is hidden from sensation, probe for it with a probe. If you feel it, pull it out with some instrument suitable for pulling it out. If you cannot reach it because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there,
then enlarge the wound until you can reach the arrow and remove it. If it has barbs, grasp them, and free the flesh embedded in them from every side by any means you can. Persist, and if you cannot free the flesh, break off the barbs and twist them until you are free.
And when you attempt to remove the arrow from any place, use the forceps to twist your hand in all directions until you free it.  Be extremely gentle, lest the arrow break and it becomes difficult for you to pull it out. If you cannot manage it at once,
leave it for a few days until the flesh around it decays, then try again; it will be easier then. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments we mentioned in that chapter.  Guard carefully against cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use skill.
By any means you can free the arrow, and let this be done gently and carefully, and firmly as I have described to you. It is necessary that when you pull out the arrow, you position the patient in the same position as when the arrow struck, for this is most suitable.
If you cannot do that, use whatever positions you can. As for an arrow that exits on the opposite side, either something of it will have emerged outwards, or you will feel the tip of the arrow under the skin nearby and see it protruding.
Make an incision there, and let the incision be large enough for the forceps. Then pull it out; it will be easy to remove. If it is stuck in a bone, twist your hand around until the arrow affects the bone and widens a space for itself; then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for some days, then try again until it comes out. If the arrow shaft is still in place, push it with that. If the shaft has fallen off and you want to use pushing, insert the hollow instrument so that its hollow enters the arrowhead, then push it with that.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that enters that hollow; the arrow will then easily come out. If the arrow is poisoned, you should, if possible, cut away all the flesh that has been poisoned, then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or abdomen, or bladder, or flank, and is close to where it can be felt with a probe, and you can incise it, then incise it, being careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then stitch the wound if it needs stitching, and treat it until it heals.  Image of the forceps with which arrows are extracted:
Their ends are like a bird's beak; they are made like a file, so that when they grasp an arrow or anything, they do not let go.  Large, small, and medium sizes of these can be made, according to the size of the arrow, and the width or narrowness of the wound.
Image of the hollow pusher:
Image of the solid pusher:
This has a solid end like an awl, to facilitate its entry into and pushing of the hollow arrow.
Chapter ninety-five.
On phlebotomy.
The veins usually opened in the body number thirty; of these, sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the "whispering" veins; the two arteries in the temples, which are visible; and the two veins at the inner canthus of the eyes, known as the "seeing" veins.
And the vein erect in the middle of the forehead; and the vein at the tip of the nose; and the two jugular veins in the neck; and the two veins in the upper lip; and the two veins in the lower lip—these veins are known as the "bleeding veins"; and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins opened in the arm and hand, they are five: one is the cephalic, which is on the outer side, and the common people call it the vein of the head; and the median cubital vein, which is the middle vein and is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the basilic, which is situated on the inner side, and is also called the axillary; and the common people call it the vein of the abdomen; and the vein of the forearm, which is situated on the ulna, and to which it adheres, and which appears clearly above the thumb; and the salem.
And this is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger; it has two branches. And in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is that which is below the hollow of the knee on the outer side; the second is the saphenous, and its place is at the heel on the inner side; and the vein of the sciatic nerve, and its place is at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three similar veins. As for the two veins behind the ears, the benefit of opening them is for chronic catarrhs, migraine, and herpes, and chronic bad sores of the head; and the manner of opening them is as I describe.
And that is to shave the head of the patient and rub the back of his head in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, rubbing well; then the patient's neck is constricted with a turban until the two veins appear, and their place is behind the ears in the two low places of the head; then you feel for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulsation under your finger, there you mark with ink.
Then you take a lancet-like scalpel, which is known as the *nashal*, then you insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone; then you raise your hand with the vein and the skin upwards and cut the vein with the skin a cut, amputating it; and the length of the cut is the amount of two fingers joined together.
Or something similar, and you let out the amount of blood you want, then you bind them with bandages and leave them until they heal.  And cutting them and cauterizing them has already been mentioned at the beginning of the book. As for the two arteries which are in the temples, the benefit of opening them is for chronic migraine, severe headache, persistent ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp humors directed towards the eyes.
And the manner of opening them is as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the veins appear clearly to the touch, and their pulsation is apparent under your finger; then you mark with ink. Then you raise the skin from above the vein upwards with your index finger.
And you insert the *nashal* scalpel from below and raise the vein upwards and amputate it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out blood according to your need; then you loosen the patient's constriction and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then you place cotton and a bandage on it and bind it tightly from above and leave it until it heals.  Their mention, cutting and cauterization have already been discussed at the beginning of the book. As for opening the vein of the forehead, its benefit, after opening the vein of the nape of the neck, is for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, ulcers, and erysipelas.
And the manner of opening it, as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the vein appears; then you take the instrument called the hatchet, and this is its image:
You place the projecting spike which is in the head of the hatchet on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar, and you leave the blood to flow to the extent that you desire; then you loosen the patient's constriction and bind it until it heals.
It may also be opened with a wide scalpel, except that the scalpel should not be sharp-pointed like other scalpels, but should be slightly wide-ended, and you incise it obliquely, because the bone is near, so the scalpel might break if it is thin.
As for the two veins which are in the temples, their benefit is for eye ailments such as ringworm, redness, and blepharitis, and facial diseases. As for the manner of opening them, it is that the patient constricts his neck with a turban, then you open them while you are standing over his head, and let the incision be slightly obliquely lengthwise with a small, slightly wide scalpel.
For the location has no flesh; if the scalpel is thin-pointed, it might break. Then you let out the amount of blood you need and place cotton on them and bind them for one night, then unbind them. As for opening the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
And severe headache and facial diseases like erysipelas which appears in the nose, especially if it is chronic.  The method of opening it is that the patient constricts his neck, then you grasp his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long scalpel.
And you pierce it in the middle of the nasal dorsum itself, between the nasal septum, in a straight line, because the vein does not appear to the touch there; then the blood emerges immediately. You should move your hand with the scalpel a little and let out the amount of blood you need, then bind it for a night, for it heals quickly.
As for the jugulars, the benefit of opening them is for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and melancholic diseases which appear on the surface of the skin such as black vitiligo, scabies, bad ulcers and cankers.  The method of opening them is that the patient constricts under them in his neck with a bandage, and the surgeon stands at the head of the patient.
And the patient sits on a chair, then you open the vein lengthwise with a slightly wide incision, then you let out a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see as necessary. Then you do likewise with the other vein, then you untie the bandage.
And you tie the veins moderately so that the patient does not suffocate, and you leave him until the next day, for the wound will heal. As for the veins of the temples, the benefit of opening them, after opening the cephalic vein, is that it benefits from cankers in the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, cracking of the lips, and bad ulcers.
which are in and around the nose.  The method of opening them is that you seat the patient before you and bind his neck with a turban, then you turn back his lips and look at the two veins, one of which you see to the right of the lip and the other to the left, and you ascertain them by their blackness.
And that is also because around them are small, black veins, so you cut them with a severed cut. If it is difficult for you and you do not know what they are, then aim to cut the largest and clearest of them.  Likewise, do with the two veins in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, the benefit of opening them after opening the cephalic vein is for the inflammations that occur in the throat from the disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth. The method of opening them is that you seat the patient in your hands facing the sun, and raise his tongue, and look under the tongue, on one side a vein and on the other side a vein, and their color is towards blackness.
Then you open them, and be careful not to go too far in cutting them, for beneath them are arteries, and perhaps bleeding from those arteries may occur. As for the three veins which are opened in the elbow, they are those which custom has established in opening them in all people, and their opening is in two ways.
Either by piercing with a wide, wind-shaped or olive-shaped lancet to the soft part, or by cutting with a knife-shaped lancet, which is the *nashal* [and this is its image], the image of the wide, wind-shaped lancet:
It is wide, as you see, so that it is suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood. And this is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:
And this lancet is less wide and thinner at the point, suitable for opening thin veins which contain thin, yellowish blood. And this is the image of the *nashal* lancet:
This *nashal*, which is suitable for cutting, and there are types of it, wide and narrow, according to the width and narrowness of the veins also. And one may infer from this to others, and it is well-known among the artisans.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from the illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from what is near the chest and belly.  It is necessary for the phlebotomist, when opening it, to beware of it and be careful about its neck, for under it is an artery. If he errs and goes too far in piercing with the lancet, he will cut that artery.
Then bleeding will occur; therefore, it is necessary that its opening not be done with a lancet for piercing, but its opening should be a cut with the *nashal*. If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to avoid it and turn to another, or seek one of its branches.
Or open in its place the vein of the arm, for it is clear, and cut it with the *nashal* lancet as we said. If you wish to open it itself, then before tightening the arm, it is necessary to feel the place until you recognize the place of the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then you tie the arm and cut the vein with a sharp cut with the *nashal* lancet, as we said, and be careful that the blow falls away from the place of the artery. And when you see, upon tightening the ligature, swelling in the place which you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood, upon opening, leaping as a boy's urine leaps, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery. Then immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the blood stops, it often stops, then tighten the arm.
And leave it. Warn the patient against neglecting it, and let him be in bed and not move for days until it heals. If the blood does not stop and it overcomes you and you do not have medicine at hand, then amputate the artery if it appears to you, for its ends contract and the blood stops.
Or take a pistachio shell and split it, and take one half and bind it tightly on the place of the vein with a ligature and bandages until the next day. If the blood stops, otherwise treat it with what was previously mentioned of placing styptics, and stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the smallness of the wound and the tightness of the ligature in the arm, inform him of that. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from the top of the head and the lower body, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, as we said.
It is necessary for the one who opens it to be careful in opening it, for there is a nerve beneath it. If he goes too deep with the lancet and injures the nerve, numbness occurs which is difficult to treat, and perhaps it will not heal at all. This nerve is often perceptible to the touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and cannot be discerned, then you should make your incision in it with a lancet and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for diseases of the eyes, and it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish to open it, to make the incision with the olive-shaped lancet or with the broad, basil-shaped lancet, because it is the safest of all veins, because there is neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it.
Except that it is necessary for you, when opening it, to avoid the head of the muscle only with the lancet and seek the soft place. It does not harm him if he is not struck on the first attempt, to be opened again repeatedly, except that it may swell in some people if it is not opened on the first attempt.
But that swelling does not harm him at all. As for the method of opening and its complications and what should be done beforehand in its treatment, the first thing is that you should know that opening is used either only to preserve health.
Or it is used in illnesses.  That which is used to preserve health and maintain it and to guard against the occurrence of illnesses is to open one of the three veins in the forearm, I mean the cephalic, the median, and the basilic, and to open it at the beginning of spring if signs of plethora appear.
And the opening should be on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of the day have passed. As for the opening which is used in illnesses, it has no limited time, but whenever necessity and need dictate it, night or day.
And at every hour and at every time. Children should not be opened until they reach fourteen years, nor old people who have passed sixty years. If someone intends to open for any reason whatsoever,
he should cleanse his bowels before opening with a gentle enema if there is much retained fecal matter, lest putrid excess from the bowels be drawn into the veins during opening and harm the principal organs.  And do not open one who is feverish, drunk or intoxicated until that passes from them.
And also avoid opening after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive coitus, exertion, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and everything that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental. Then look to thinning the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
with foods, drinks, and medicines if he is able to do so; then he should enter the bath if nothing prevents him, or engage in some exercise so that the blood is thinned, and make his opening in the middle of the day as we said, and he should aim to free his chest that day from all bad mental affections.
such as worries, anger, and fear, and from all physical affections like excessive exertion and toil, coitus, and the like. And he should have at his disposal the things that people are accustomed to using, such as various perfumes, aromatic plants, entertainment, and the like, each person according to his means.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion higher than the cushion on which the patient sits, then he extends his arm and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then he tightens the ligature with the fillet and twists it two or three times, and let the tightening be moderate.
For if the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening, it prevents the flow of blood, or if it is relaxed, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then, after tightening, the patient should rub both his hands together.
until the veins swell and become perceptible to the touch. Then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, especially, then he places the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself a little below the place which he wishes to open, lest the vein slip away and avoid the incision. For some veins are like tendons, they slip away during phlebotomy, and some are filled with wind, so when the lancet is placed upon them, they sink beneath the lancet, deceiving the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein, or if it does open it, it is only a narrow opening.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be careful and deliberate in all these matters, then he lowers the lancet; if the vein is opened on that attempt, well and good; otherwise, he repeats it another time a little below or above that place quickly if the place is not swollen.
If the patient swells or is frightened, leave him for a day or two and do not tighten the ligature, for it may bring on a hot swelling, and he should not enter the bath, then he may repeat the phlebotomy if he wishes. If the lancet is inserted and the opening is small and the flow of blood is thin,
and you fear that the desired quantity of blood will not be drawn, replace the lancet in the same opening gently and straight, and increase the opening slightly, and do this quickly before the place swells, for in many people the place may swell with a small opening.
But if you see that it has swollen, do not repeat it at all, for it will not help you; put on it some oil dregs, for it facilitates the flow of blood, and it is better in this case than oil itself and other ointments as well.
Therefore, use oil dregs in all your phlebotomies when the flow of blood is difficult.  The theriac Pharun and the  shakhznaja may also do this if one of them is placed on the area, for the blood will thin and dissolve if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of phlebotomy—and this often happens, especially to those who have been phlebotomized only once or whose opening of the vein was small—act quickly and place on the swelling a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water and bind it for an hour, for it will resolve.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has completely exited from the vein itself or from another vein. If something of blackness or greenness remains in the area after several days, it does no harm. If you wish, apply something of aloes and bitter substances which have been dissolved.
Or something of the juice of the foudanj and the like.  Often a swelling and a pustule occur when phlebotomizing the basilic vein; place your hand upon it. If you find that it softens when you gently touch it, then it is a bad pustule, and beware of putting anything on it of what we have mentioned.
For perhaps arterial blood will flow from it; but compress it with something astringent to constrict the area, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.  It is necessary that you extract from each person a quantity of blood according to his strength and what appears of the color dominating the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it becomes red; and likewise if you see it thick, let it flow until it thins; and likewise if it is sharp, until its sharpness is gone.  It is necessary for one who is full-bodied and strong, and needs to have blood removed at once,
to widen the incision in the vein and the lancet to be wide. And for one who is weak, the opposite. And it is necessary to extract it in stages, and the opening to be narrow. And the best thing to use in phlebotomy is a sharp, well-sharpened, incised, not pierced, instrument.
And this type of phlebotomy is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve; and it is better and safer than phlebotomy across or lengthwise. And if anyone is accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, it is necessary that you feed him before phlebotomy something of bread soaked in pomegranate water or oxymel.
If he is feverish and blood is extracted from him in three or four times, then if he is of cold temperament, let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in hydromel or in honeyed syrup seasoned with aromatics or in pleasantly-scented syrup.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy and its cause is the copious outflow of blood, then it is necessary to give him meat broth and thin aromatic syrup, and to use perfumes of gālīyā and to rub his chest with it, and to use all that we have mentioned in the section on fainting.
which results from vomiting. And as for one who wishes to relieve his arm and to let his blood flow again, it is necessary for one whose phlebotomy was for copious evacuation and whose strength is weak, that the blood be let little by little according to his strength on consecutive days.
And as for one who wishes to relieve his arm and to let his blood flow again and his body is strong, let him do that after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy. And as for one who wishes to draw the blood from his body to the opposite side to which it inclined, it is necessary to relieve him on the second or third day.
And as for one in whose body the blood is abundant, has become hot and sharp and has caused fever, it is necessary to extract the blood from him in one go and to extract a large quantity and to widen the opening until fainting occurs, after you have checked all the conditions for phlebotomy. And that you place your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, lest death occur instead of fainting, for that often happens if the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs. And it is not necessary, if you wish to loosen the arm and let the blood flow again,
and the mouth of the vein has closed and the exit of blood has become difficult, that you prick it forcefully or twist it strongly, for that is very bad; rather, either you leave it until you phlebotomize it again, or you remove with the blade of the lancet what has solidified of the blood in the mouth of the vein.
Or you apply to it something of salt dissolved in water, or you apply to it something of theriac faruq or shakhzanaya and prick it gently until the blood comes out; and if the vein has swollen, leave it.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides; and if necessity dictates letting the blood flow again and it is unavoidable, either phlebotomize above that place or phlebotomize in the other arm or in another vein.
And as for phlebotomizing the vein of the arm, it is phlebotomized instead of the basilic and cephalic veins if they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of them; and its method of phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly, then it is tied above it with a ligature slightly with moderate tightness.
Then you phlebotomize the vein at a slight angle, neither across nor lengthwise, and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be slightly above the joint of the hand; and if the exit of blood is difficult, return the hand to the vessel with the hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until it reaches your need; and if you are in the summer days, you may dispense with returning the hand to the hot water, and most of what causes the blood to flow in hot water is in the wintertime; and phlebotomizing this vein is safer than all veins. Because there is no intersecting vein or nerve under it; and as for phlebotomizing the vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the liver; and its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after you put it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no intersecting vein or nerve under it; and as for phlebotomizing the vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the liver; and its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after you put it in hot water until the vein swells. And it becomes very apparent to the touch, then you phlebotomize it at a slight angle; and even if you sever it completely, it will not harm him at all; and be careful not to plunge your hand with the lancet, for under it is the nerve of the fingers, and the place is bare of flesh; then return the hand to the hot water.
And leave it to flow the blood in it; for if you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will congeal in the mouth of the vein and cease flowing; and when you have removed the amount of blood needed, place on the vein fat and salt lest it close quickly.
And similarly you should do with every narrow branch; and as for the benefit of phlebotomizing from the left hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen; and similarly you do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second, the same; and as for phlebotomizing the saphenous vein, its benefit is for the diseases in the lower body, such as ailments of the uterus.
And retention of menstruation, and diseases of the kidneys, and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases; and its method of phlebotomy is that he puts his leg in hot water and rubs it until the veins swell, then you tie above the joint of the leg with a ligature, and the vein is located at the heel, apparent toward the thumb.
And from it branch out in the front of the leg many branches; so phlebotomize in its widest branch, or at the heel at its confluence, for that is best and safest; for if you phlebotomize in the front of the leg, then be careful of the nerves which are under it on the front of the leg.
And make your incision in it by twisting, as if you intend to amputate it, and let the scalpel be sharp; and if the exit of the blood is difficult, let him return his leg to the hot water, and leave the blood to flow in it until it is emptied; and if the phlebotomist misses the vein in the first attempt,
let him return with the phlebotomy a little higher, for the place is safe, and there is no fear of harm from it if you are careful of the nerve, as we said; and similarly you do with the saphenous vein of the other leg, the same; and as for the sciatic vein, its place is, as we said, at the heel from the outer side.
And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for hip pain, if that is from hot blood; and its method of phlebotomy is that you put the patient in the bath and hurry, and tie his leg from the hip to above the heel by four fingers with a thin long bandage, for it does not appear except by that.
Then, if it appears, phlebotomize it in any way that you please, either by twisting—and that is best—or by amputating it, or by incising it, for its place is safe, and it is in most people very hidden; and if you do not find it,
and it does not appear at all to the touch, phlebotomize some of its branches, which are those that appear on the back of the foot towards the little finger and the ring finger, and be careful of the nerves, and let out the amount of blood that you want.
Then untie the bandage and place cotton on the place of phlebotomy and bandage the place, for it quickly heals.
Chapter ninety-six.
Concerning cupping and its method of use.
Cupping instruments may be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass, and cupping is of two types: one is cupping with incision and the extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without incision.
And this cupping without incision is of two types.
And the cupping of the mastoids, which are the sides of the neck on both sides, and the cupping of the chin, which is below the lower jaw, and the cupping of the shoulders, and the cupping of the coccyx on the rump, and the cupping of the forearms, which are the middles of the arms, and the cupping of the legs, and the cupping of the ankles.
Cupping draws blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh; and for that reason, it does not weaken the body as bloodletting does, nor should cupping, whether with fire or without, be used in any disease caused by plethora until the whole body is purged.
If cupping is needed because of illness or habit, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle, or at any time.
That is because some people, when their blood increases to the point that it needs to be removed by cupping, feel heaviness and headache; and some feel fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck; and some feel itching in their face and sides, and darkness and burning in their eyes; and some itch at the site of their cupping.
And some laugh a lot; and some find the taste of blood in their mouth, and their gums swell, and they spit blood; and some sleep a lot; and some see blood, redness, pus, and wounds in their sleep, and things like that.  Whenever we see any of that...
especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours of the day have passed. As for the benefit of cupping the temples, it benefits from heaviness in the head and water pouring into the eyes.
But it should be after emptying the whole body. This cupping can be a substitute for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein. It is cautioned against using it for those who are cold-headed or have a cold, for it harms them greatly.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold diseases in their heads should not use it, and those who overuse it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, you should instruct the cupper to lower his hand with the cupping glass a little lower, for fear of generating forgetfulness. As for cupping the nape of the neck, it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic and cephalic veins.
Therefore, it benefits from asthma, shortness of breath, rupture of the respiratory apparatus, cough, and fullness.  The cupping of the nape of the neck should be raised a little, for if it is lowered, it will produce weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it benefits from headaches, ophthalmia, migraine, angina, and toothache. It is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic vein. You should instruct the cupper not to deepen his hand in the incision, lest he cut a vein and cause bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it benefits from thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases in the mouth. It may substitute for phlebotomy of the labial veins. As for cupping the shoulders, it benefits from palpitations that result from fullness and heat.
As for cupping the inner sides of the forearms, it benefits from what benefits phlebotomy of the three veins, the basilic, cephalic, and median cephalic, because it draws blood from all those small veins in the flesh and draws those small veins from other thicker veins until the drawing reaches the three large veins.
You should instruct the cupper not to deepen the incision because the area is devoid of flesh and underneath are nerves and arteries. As for single cupping applied to the coccyx, it benefits from hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
You should instruct the cupper that the cupping glass should be large and made of copper, because the area needs strong suction, and a glass cupping glass might break and require many incisions. As for cupping the legs, it visibly reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the whole body and benefits from chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, it promotes menstruation, and benefits from boils and abscesses. It substitutes for phlebotomy of the saphenous veins and the veins of the ankles, but it greatly weakens the body and causes fainting in most people. Cupping the ankles has benefits similar to cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping glasses is to first place the empty cupping glass and apply moderate suction. Do not prolong the application of the cupping glasses, but place and remove them quickly so that the humors are drawn to the area evenly. Continue to repeat this until you see the area redden and open.
When the redness of blood appears, then make an incision and resume suction slowly. Then consider the condition of the bodies. If a person has loose flesh and porous skin, you should only make one incision so that the area does not ulcerate.
Instruct the cupper to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, and to adjust the suction gently and with a light movement. If the blood is thick, then two incisions should be made; the first to open a path for the thin and watery blood, and the second to thoroughly remove the thick blood.
If the blood is very thick, repeat the incision a third time to achieve the desired result. In general, if we want to remove a small amount of blood, one incision suffices; if we want to remove a large amount of blood, we make more incisions, especially if we consider the blood to be thick.
It is necessary to make a deep incision, and the moderate limit of the incision is only the depth of the skin. What ointments should be used when applying cupping glasses, and what waters, and what the cupper should avoid. As for someone whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and with tight pores,
the areas where the cupping glasses will be applied should be anointed with opening, softening, and resolving ointments. If it is summer, then use rose ointment, violet ointment, sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
And if it is winter, then use narcissus oil, iris oil, chamomile oil, or lily oil, and the like. If the waste matter is thick and cold, then let the ointment be marjoram oil, balm oil, sesame oil, or rue oil, and the like.
If the patient has wide pores and soft flesh, then the ointment should be avoided. These people should wash their cupping sites after cupping with rose water, cold water, fox grape water, gourd water, or chickweed water, and the like. As for someone whose blood is very moist,
he should wash his cupping sites with vinegar, or with water of  asafoetida and sumac, and the like. As for someone whose waste matter is thick, he should wash his cupping sites with old wine, or with marjoram water, or a decoction of rue or chamomile, and the like. Cupping should be avoided in the bathhouse and immediately after bathing.
Rather, it should be done an hour or two after leaving the bathhouse. No one should sleep after cupping. What should be done for the patient before and after cupping.
First, one must look. If the patient is choleric and his blood is predominantly sharp and inflamed, then he should take cooling things such as pomegranate, dandelion with vinegar, lettuce, oxymel, and sharbat, and the like.  His food should include poultry, lamb stew, and sour things, and the like.
And if his temperament is cold, then he should be given honeyed drinks, or a drink of dates or seed oxymel. He should consume moderately sweet wine, that which is between old and new. He should be ordered to eat little, and his food should be poultry,  quails, songbirds, and squabs in a stew.  Drink should be more plentiful than food on the day of cupping and phlebotomy.
It may be necessary in some cases for some people to be given Mithridatium, or musk medicine, or theriac before cupping and phlebotomy, or afterward, to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood.  Those with fever should not be given this.
As for cupping without scarification, this is cupping applied to the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney region, and hip joint, because these organs do not tolerate scarification.  Rather, the aim is to draw blood from one organ to another.
Such as placing the cupping glass on the breasts for epistaxis, or using it to draw out cold wind which has lodged in an organ, such as placing the cupping glass on the abdomen and navel. This loosens the organ, warms it, and removes the pain by resolving that wind.
It may be placed on the kidneys if there is an obstruction or stone there, for by its drawing power it may open the obstruction or dislodge the stone. Similarly, it acts if placed on the liver and spleen in the case of wind that troubles them.  These cuppings may be used empty, by suction alone.
It may be used with fire, or it may be used filled with lukewarm water for ailments of the chest.  That is, fill the cupping glass, and let it be a large one, with hot water alone, or with water in which some herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Then, filled, it is placed on the affected area, held, removed, and repeated as needed.  This is an image of the cupping glass used with fire:
Its mouth should be the width of two open fingers, as we have pictured, and its depth half a span.  There should be a small hole in its side, about halfway down, large enough for a needle to enter. It is made of Chinese copper or yellow copper, with a thick rim.
Smooth, even, and polished, so that it does not injure the member when placed upon it. In its center there is a transverse groove of copper or iron, where the burning candle is placed. This cupping glass may be made larger than we have described, or smaller, according to the disease.
And we will explain its use, for the cupping glasses of children and thin people are not the same as those of men and stout-bodied people. As for the method of applying this cupping glass with fire to the member, it is to prepare a burning wick of tightly-woven linen or a small candle of pitch, and to place it on the middle of the hardened rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass.
So that the fire ascends upwards towards the bottom of the cupping glass, so that the patient's body is not burned. Then it is placed on the member, with the finger on the hole we mentioned, so that when we have held the cupping glass as long as necessary, the finger is removed.
And the vapor escapes through that hole, and the cupping glass adheres to the place. Then prepare the wick in the same way and reapply it if necessary.  As for the cupping glass which is used in the treatment of phlegmon with water, it has neither a hardened rod nor a hole.
It is only used by being filled with water and placed on the member. This is its image:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to hold much water, the better it is.
Chapter ninety-seven.
On the suspension of the leech.
Leeches are used mostly in cases where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either because of smallness, like the lip and gum and the like, or because the member is bare of flesh, like the finger and nose and the like.
And the manner of using them is that you obtain leeches which are in fresh, pure waters, free from impurities; then leave them a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry and nothing remains in their bellies. Then the body is first purged by bloodletting or cupping, then the affected member is wiped.
Until it reddens, then it is placed upon it; and when it is full, it falls off. And if it is possible to suck the place with a cupping glass, that is more effective; otherwise, wash the place with vinegar, then with much water, and rub and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and this is a trickle, then let a linen cloth be wetted in cold water.
And place it on top until the trickle stops. If the blood is profuse, sprinkle on it powdered vitriol or alum or the like of astringents until the bleeding stops, or place on the affected area halves of peeled lupins.
And leave it until the lupin adheres to the place, for then the blood will stop.  And it is preferable, if it is necessary to reapply leeches, that those leeches not be reapplied if others are available. If the leeches refuse to adhere, then let the place be wiped with fresh blood.
Or pierce a needle into the place until some blood comes out, then apply them; for when they sense some blood, they will adhere in place.  If you wish to remove them, sprinkle on them some aloes or salt or ashes, for then they will fall off immediately.
Chapter Three.
On setting (bones).
This chapter also contains what is necessary in the art of medicine, which is the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never perused any book of the ancients on it nor read a single letter thereof.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become extinct in our country, and I have never encountered anyone at all who is skilled in it. Rather, I derived what I have derived from it through my long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them, until I extracted knowledge of it from them, and then I adhered to experimentation and practice throughout my life.
And I have drawn for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses. And my experience has followed upon it after I have brought it close to you and freed it from the ramifications of prolixity, and I have abridged it to the utmost, and clarified it to the utmost, and I have depicted for you therein many pictures of the instruments that are used in it.
For it is an increase in explanation, as I did in the preceding two chapters. And there is no strength except in God, the Most High, the Magnificent.
Chapter One.
In it are summaries and compendia concerning the matter of fractured bones, and it is necessary to present them. And before we begin to mention the fractured and dislocated members one by one, it is necessary that we mention at the beginning of this chapter a summary of the discourse and sections. It compels you first to understand them and to stand upon their reality, you and others besides you who are eager to learn this noble craft.
So I say that when a fracture, dislocation, wound, or fall occurs to someone, it is necessary to hasten first to bleed him or to purge him, or both. Unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength, or if the one to whom this has happened is a child or a very old man, or if the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then he should restrict his diet to cold vegetables and the meat of birds and hares, and he should avoid drink, strong meats, and overeating, and all foods that fill the veins with blood, until the swelling is safe and the effusion of matter to the place is not expected.
Then let the patient return to his first regimen, to which he is accustomed. When the fractured bone begins to knit, the patient should be nourished with foods that provide abundant, thick, strong nourishment with viscosity, such as pottages, rice, heads, and gizzards, and cow stomachs. And eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and the like; for by this regimen the consolidation of the fracture will be quicker and better. And know that fractured bones, if they are in strong men and old men, cannot ever unite and heal to their original nature.
Because of the dryness and hardness of their bones.  And it may unite and heal where the bones were extremely soft, like the bones of small children.  But nature produces on the fractured bone from all its sides something resembling glue, thick, which adheres to it and binds it until one part holds to another.
And it binds one part to another until it comes to the utmost strength and firmness as it was at first, so that nothing hinders its actions.
For this reason, it is necessary to give the patient foods which contain firmness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said. And know that fractures differ in their kinds according to the differences in the members, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone.
And so are all the other members, each different from the other.  We shall come to the mention of each kind of fracture, explained in its chapter, detailed separately from the others.  And the kind of bone fracture may also differ in itself.
For it may be fractured by splintering without fragments being produced, and it may be fractured lengthwise with fragments and protrusions, separated and unseparated.  And the fracture may be with a wound and perforation in the skin, and the fracture may be a slight crack.
And for each kind there is a special method of setting it, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. And what makes a bone fracture known is its crookedness, swelling, its being apparent to the touch, and its creaking when you touch it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor creaking, nor do you feel any disturbance when you touch the bone, nor does the patient feel much pain, then there is no fracture, but it may be a sprain, or a slight fracture, or a slight crack; therefore it should not be moved by stretching and probing at all.
Rather, apply to it some of the medicines, the mention of which will come after a while, what suits the place, then bind it gently. And know that if the bone is broken and split in two without fragments being produced, except that each part has been separated from its fellow.
Then you should hasten at once to straighten and align it before a hot swelling occurs to it.  If a hot swelling occurs to it, then leave it for some days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in whatever way you are able with gentleness and skill.
And know that its setting and alignment is easier than a bone in which fragments have occurred. Then it is bound as will be mentioned.  If the bone has fragments, then it is necessary to stretch the broken limb from both sides, whether hand or foot.
Either with your hands, if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand. And let your placing of the limb be on a level surface, in its natural shape, until when the broken part of the bone is extended, then return those fragments to their places in whatever way you are able with skill and gentleness.
And strive with all your effort that you do not cause the patient pain or hurt by your action, and strive with all your effort to unite one of the bones with its fellow in the best way. And it is necessary at that time that you touch them and feel them with your hand.  If you see there anything contrary, correct and align it to the best of your ability.
And beware of strong extension and forceful probing, as many ignorant people do, and they often cause by their action a hot swelling or stiffness in the limb, as I have witnessed from their actions repeatedly.
Then, after the setting, perfection, and binding, keep that limb still and quiet, and warn the patient not to move it during his wakefulness and sleep, and during his turning and restlessness, and during his evacuation and all his movements, to the best of his ability, and that he should strive to keep the limb in a position where he will be safe from pain.
That is because, whenever he feels pain or ache in the position of the limb, he should move it to another position where he does not feel pain, and he should strive, moreover, that that position be level and straight.
Lest crookedness occur in the limb if it is set, and as for the method of binding the broken limb, it is as I describe to you. Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness and largeness and shapes; those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and the like.
Then it is necessary that the bandages be soft and gentle, and those that are thick, like the thigh, back, and chest, then it is necessary that the bandages be wide and firm, for a wide bandage is necessary for a large limb and binds it from every side with equal tightness so that no flaw interferes.
Then, after you have finished the setting, you begin to apply the appropriate plaster. With a soft, gentle movement on the place of the fracture, then you begin to wrap the bandage on the place of the fracture itself three or four times, according to what the limb requires, and you tighten your hand slightly with the bandage, then you take it to the upper side of the place of the fracture.
With less tightening than your tightening of the broken place, then you move the wrapping away from the place of the fracture a little and loosen the tightening little by little until you take from the correct place something suitable, then you take another bandage and wrap it also on the broken place.
Wrappings, then you take the wrapping to the lower side of the fracture, and let your action in tightening and loosening the wrapping be as we mentioned in the first upper wrapping, then you place between the bandages from the soft padding or rags what straightens the crookedness of the fracture.
If there is a crookedness, otherwise do not put anything in it, then you wrap around it another bandage, then you set on these bandages the firm splints at once if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, then apply what calms that inflammation and removes the swelling, and leave it for days, then tighten the splints on it then, and let the splints be from wide, carved, skillfully prepared halves of reeds, or let the splints be from sieve wood.
Which are made from pine or palm leaves or  *khulanj* or *kalkh* and similar things which are available, and let the width of each splint be in this image and this shape exactly.
Except that the splint which is placed on the fracture itself should be a little thicker and wider than the other splints, and as for the length of the splint, it is made according to what suits the broken limb, in its size and smallness, image of the splint:
Then you tighten the splints with another bandage, according to your first tightening exactly, then you tie from above with firm threads according to what we mentioned of the tightening, which is that your tightening on the place of the fracture should be more. And the further from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and fineness, and let them be of wet linen especially, because if the threads are thick, as I have seen done by the ignorant who make their threads from twisted linen strips, it is a great mistake.
Because the tightening with them falls outside moderation, and thin threads are also unsuitable because you do not achieve with them the tightening you want, and there should not be less than a finger between splint and splint.
If the patient is harmed by the ends of the splints after tightening in the healthy places, then place under them soft tow or fluffy wool so that nothing harms him from that. As for if the fracture is with a wound and a rupture occurs in the skin, we will mention that separately.
And know that not every broken limb should be tightened with splints from the first day, and that is that if the limb is large, splints should not be placed on it except after five or seven days or more, according to your assurance of the avoidance of hot swelling.
And this is the description of the bandages with which the ancients used to bind fractures, dislocations, and wounds; a description of a general, brief bandage that binds fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is not overcome by heat or cold.
And it is that you take from the dust of the mill, which is the essence of the flour that clings to the walls of the mill during the movement of the mill, then knead it as it is without sifting it with egg white, and make its kneading neither thick nor thin, then you apply it.
The description of another bandage that binds fractures, dislocations, and wounds: take from mastic, leadwort, acacia, resin, gum arabic, and sugar, ten drachms of each; and myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; and from the lote tree, twenty drachms; and from Armenian or Roman clay, twenty drachms. All is pounded and mixed with lote tree water, or with egg white if the patient's temperament is hot, then this bandage is used, for it is good in composition, quickly binds broken bones, and is suitable for most people because of its moderation.
The description of another bandage that is also useful for fractures and wounds: take gum arabic, mastic, and white leadwort, ten drachms of each; myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; acacia, six drachms; Armenian clay, twenty drachms.  All is pounded finely, sifted, kneaded with water or egg white, and used.
The description of a bandage for joints and bones that have shifted from their places, and it soothes the pain affecting them, and for bone cracks and fractures: take purified wool and soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply it to the place. This bandage does not have the power to set [bones].
But it is excellent in soothing hot swelling and relieving pain in particular. The description of another bandage that sets broken bones: take the leaves of the mute fig and the leaves of wild poppy, pound them all together, and bandage with them while moist. The description of another brief bandage used when a bone fracture is knitting.
And you want to resolve the rest of the swelling, take of the root of leadwort, chamomile, violet flowers, and crushed acorns, one part of each; pound all together and knead it with egg white if the member is not inflamed; if it is inflamed, knead it with coriander water or water, and use it.
The description of another bandage stronger in resolving than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs when the bone is knitting: take of the root of leadwort, flaxseed, fenugreek, rue, germander, violet flowers, and chamomile, one part of each.
Pound all together and knead with vinegar water, or with fresh water, or with egg white, all according to the heat of the member and the quietness of its inflammation. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that it should be placed on the broken member when it is set.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil only, and he described it as being moderate between thickness and thinness. As for Galen, he saw that things that have drying properties with some heat, such as myrrh, aloes, frankincense, and the like that we mentioned, should be placed on the broken member when it is set.
The description of a bandage that benefits weakness and pain: take  mugwort,  fenugreek, human hair that is clipped or bird feathers, leadwort and salt, equal parts; pound and sift, knead and bandage with it. As for the amount that the bandage should remain.
Then it is to be loosened; you should look, and if no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place occurs in the afflicted area, do not loosen it for many days.  If intense itching or disturbing pain or swelling occurs in the area.
Then hasten to loosen it at once and do not delay that at all, and remove the bandage from it. Then take a soft cloth or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching and pain subside, then let the member rest for an hour.
Then apply carded wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil and bandage it for a night until you are safe from hot swelling and the member's swelling subsides and its pain goes away. Then return it to gentle tightening and a light bandage, and do not tighten it as tightly as the first time.
And treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and puffiness, and all the symptoms have completely disappeared and you need a bandage and tightening, then repeat as you did initially, the same. If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs in the member.
Then do not loosen it except after three, four, five, or seven days, and it may be left for twenty days; all this depends on what appears to you from the condition of the member, as we said, until the fracture is set and the flesh nears consolidation on it.
Then also increase the tightening more than your first tightening, and also increase the patient's nourishment as previously mentioned. If you see that the place of the fracture has dried and atrophied more than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Then bathe it with lukewarm water each time you loosen it, and let that be every three days, and loosen the tightening a little. For by this action, nourishment will reach the member and it will heal quickly. As for what ignorant bone-setters do of breaking the member again.
If it is not set properly initially, and it is set crookedly, then that is an error of their action and a great deception. And if it were correct, the predecessors would have mentioned it in their books and it would have been practiced, and I have seen no trace of it at all from any of them. And the correct thing is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
On accidental fractures in the head.
The types of accidental fractures in the head are numerous, their forms varied, and their causes diverse.  Some fractures are caused by a sword blow, and this may either sever the bone completely until it reaches the membrane under the bone. Just as the wedge does in wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a wedge fracture.  It may also be that the sword cuts some of the bone and severs only its surface, without the cut penetrating completely through it; this type of fracture is called an absolute avulsion, and the wound of both of these fractures may be either large or small.
And there are fractures which are comminuted or contused, and their cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone, or something similar. This fracture may be penetrating, nearly reaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be in the surface of the bone.
And the wound of these two fractures is also either large or small. And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone, as thin as a hair, which is a slight crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called hairline.  There is also a fracture which results from a fall or a blow from a stone or the like, which drives a portion of the bone inward, making a depression in the area, just as happens to a copper pot when struck, causing a part of it to be driven inward.
This most often occurs in the soft bones of the head, such as the heads of children. All of these types of fractures may have loose and non-loose fragments; we shall describe the treatment of all of these in their proper place, and we shall identify all these types of fractures by examining them.
And examining them with probes and removing the corrupted flesh from them. As for the hairline type, it is identified by exposing the bone, wiping it, and smearing it with ink; then the fracture will appear black. As for the treatment of fractures, first look at the symptoms of the patient.
If you see in his symptoms that which clearly indicates danger, such as vomiting bile, extension, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, sinking of the eyes, and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, then do not approach the patient nor treat him, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
But if you see symptoms that do not frighten you and you hope for his safety, then begin his treatment. And that is that if the wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded, and that is in the days of winter,
then you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case. And if it is in the days of summer, then you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone becomes corrupted and those symptoms which we have described appear.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain and there is crushing and contusion, then you should cut away the crushed and contused part as I describe to you. And that is that you shave the head of the wounded patient.
And uncover the bone in whatever way is possible for you and according to the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient. If, when you uncover the bone, you find bleeding or a hot swelling, then treat that as is appropriate.
And that is that you pack the place with cloths soaked in a syrup and rose oil, and cleanse the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then you begin to remove and extract the bone, and this is done in one of two ways.
As for the first method, it is that you cut the bone with a delicate saw with a narrow blade, and this is its image:
Then you use another saw after this one, a little wider, and this is its image:
Then you also use another saw, wider still than the second.  It is necessary that you have several different saws, some wider than others, and some shorter than others, and they should be extremely sharp at their edges, and let them be of Indian iron or good steel.
And use gentleness in striking the saw, lest you shake the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and solid, then it is necessary that you pierce around it before using the saws, with the drills which are called non-immersive drills, and they are called non-immersive drills.
Because they do not go beyond the limit of the cranial bone to what is beyond it, for the drill has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a ring or small circle, preventing it from sinking and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
And it is necessary for you to take many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have for each skull a drill whose sharp point is in length and shortness according to the thickness of that skull.  And this is an image of three types. Of the drills: large, medium, and small.
As for the method of piercing around the fractured bone, it is that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then you move the drill to another place, and you make the distance between each hole the thickness of an awl or similar.
Then cut between each two holes with the forceps, and do this with the utmost gentleness as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with something else from among the instruments that you have prepared for that.
Such as forceps and delicate hooks. And it is necessary that you take great care that the drill or forceps does not touch anything of the peritoneum. If the bone is cleaned and freed from the peritoneum, if it is adhering to it, and you have removed it, then it is necessary that you cleanse it.
And smooth the roughness that remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the forceps, except that it should be thinner and more delicate than the other forceps. If something remains of the small bones and fragments, then take them gently with the instruments that you have.
Then you treat the wound afterwards with sutures and ointments, the mention of which will come. As for the other method of operation, it is a very easy method, far from danger; Galen mentioned it and praised it greatly, and this is his saying. First, you should begin by uncovering the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and evident, until, when you have uncovered that part, you place under it the end of these lenticular forceps, and this is its image:
The lenticular part of it is smooth, so that it does not cut anything, and the sharp part of it is on its sides going lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests against the peritoneum and the face of the sharp cutting edge is on the bone. Then you strike the forceps on one side.
With a small hammer, until you cut all the bone gently as it rotates, and you are safe from the membrane, so that nothing frightening happens in it at all, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were sleepy.
If anything of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some parts of the bone, then scrape it off with the tip of the lenticular forceps itself and free it gently, for it will be freed from it without harm or fear.
But if the fracture of the bone did not penetrate to the membrane, and what was broken from the bone was its surface, and roughness and small fragments remained in it, then it is necessary to remove that roughness and extract those fragments with fine forceps, which have been made in various sizes so that you can use the most suitable and appropriate ones in each place, according to what the work leads you to.
And the broken bone itself and its shape, and it is necessary that you use first in your scraping of the bone the widest of those forceps, then use after it a finer one, and continue to do that successively until you come to using the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the other small, hair-like fissures and slight fractures, it is necessary to use for each one a treatment according to what leads to its healing, which is something that is not hidden from anyone who has the least skill in this craft and has studied what we have written and explained concerning large fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you extract the bone, then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth. And dip it in syrup and rose oil and place it on the first cloth, and do that as gently as you can so as not to burden the peritoneum, then use a wide bandage on top and do not tighten it except to the extent that it only holds the wound.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are sure of the hot swelling, then untie it and use afterwards medicines that have a drying quality, such as the roots of iris, and powdered costus, and powdered spikenard, and zedoary, and the like; and that is that you make powders from these medicines.
And sprinkle it on the wound as it is dry; and in general, use in that a medicine that cleanses and does not sting, and strive hard during your treatment of the wound that it be clean, free from the filth of oil and dirt, and do not allow pus to collect in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts and rots it, and from that great harm befalls the patient; and it may occur in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
Blackness on its surface; if the patient shows the symptoms that we have mentioned, know that he is inevitably doomed, unless the blackness occurred due to a medicine applied to it, and it was in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness.
It is necessary that you take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and mix them well, and smear them on a cloth, then place it on the peritoneum, then treat it with the various treatments that are necessary until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the setting of a broken nose.
Know that only the upper two parts of the nose, or one of them, can be broken, because they are bones, for the lower part of it is cartilaginous and does not break, but rather it is subject to contusion, crookedness, and flattening.
If one of its parts is broken, then it is necessary that you insert your little finger into the nostril and straighten that fracture from the inside with your index and thumb fingers from the outside, until you return the nose to its natural shape. Let this be done gently by you, and be careful that your actions do not cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger does not reach it, then it should be straightened with the end of a small, slightly thick probe. If the fracture is on both sides, do likewise, and let him hasten to treat it on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling subsides, then insert into the nostril a tent of linen rags if the fracture is on one side, or insert two tents if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the thickness of the tent be such that it fills the nostril. Some of the early bone-setters mentioned that the tent should be moistened with fat and changed every day, but I do not see this, rather the tent should be moistened with egg white mixed with powdered alum.
Then leave the tent until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens.  Goose quill tubes may be inserted into the nose at the site of the tent after wrapping them with soft rags, this will make the retention for the nasal fracture stronger and so that the patient does not have difficulty breathing.
This is not necessary; you may do it or you may make tents. If a hot swelling appears in the nose during your work, apply a compress to the nose with quince or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil or some diachylon ointment.
If no hot swelling appears, then you should dress it externally with finely ground semolina and finely ground myrrh mixed with egg white, then put a soft bandage on it, and do not bind the nose at all, if the nasal bones are fractured with a small fracture.
Or if it is shattered, then it should be incised and removed with the appropriate instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with appropriate ointments that unite and heal. If a wound occurs inside the nose, then it should be treated with a tent and lead tubes should be used. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the setting of the lower jaw if it is fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, then if the fracture is only external and it is not fractured in two places and is not depressed inwards, then its identification is easy.
It is necessary that if the fracture is in the right ramus, you should insert the index finger of the left hand into the mouth of the patient, and similarly if the fracture is in the left ramus, you should insert the index finger of the right hand and gently raise the prominence of the fracture from the inside to the outside.
And with your other hand from outside the bone, you control it to straighten it. If the fracture of the jaw has been fractured in two places, then it is necessary to use traction from both sides to straighten it until you are able to straighten it, if a displacement has occurred in the teeth.
Or if they are separated, then tie what you hope will remain with a gold, silver, or silk thread, then place a pledget on the fractured jaw, then place a folded cloth over it, and place a large, tight splint or a piece of leather the length of the jaw over the cloth. Then tie it from above according to what seems suitable to you to tie it and agrees with its binding so that it does not become undone, and order the patient to rest and be still, and make his food soft liquids. If you think that something has changed in its form in any way, then hasten to untie it on the third day.
Then tie it from above according to what seems suitable to you to tie it and agrees with its binding so that it does not become undone, and order the patient to rest and be still, and make his food soft liquids. If you think that something has changed in its form in any way, then hasten to untie it on the third day. Then repair what you have bandaged with mill dust mixed with egg white or semolina flour after removing the pledget from it, and place a soft compress on the bandage. As long as that bandage adheres to it and the condition of the bone has not changed, leave it.
Do not untie it until it heals and the fracture becomes firm. Often this fracture becomes firm in three weeks. If a hot inflammation occurs during that time, use what we have repeatedly mentioned to soothe it until that inflammation goes away.
And if the fracture is with a wound, look: if a splinter or splinters have separated from the bone, then be gentle in removing those splinters with whatever instrument suits you for their removal. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, then widen it with a scalpel to the extent of your need.
Then, when you have removed those splinters and nothing remains of them, stitch the mouth of the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for that. And stitch the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the setting of the clavicle if it is fractured.
The clavicle is most often fractured in front, at the end of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it is broken and split into two without splinters, which is easiest to set;
or splinters occur in the fracture, which is more difficult to set; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.  The procedure, if the fracture is without a wound, is that you prepare two assistants, one to hold the arm next to the fractured clavicle, and the other to extend the neck toward the other side.
Then you set the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and there is neither protrusion nor irregularity. If you need more extension, then you should place a ball of rags or wool under the armpit of the patient.
The size of the ball should suit your needs.  You extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is set as it should be. If you are unable to pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it has gone inwards, then the patient should lie on his back.
A moderately sized pillow is placed under his shoulder, and the assistant presses his shoulder downwards until the clavicle which is deep rises upwards. Then, set the fracture and smooth it with your fingers.
If you feel that a splinter of the clavicle has broken off and is moving, then you should make an incision over it and remove that splinter gently. If the splinter is embedded in the bone, then try to cut it with one of the cutting instruments which you have prepared for this purpose. After you place under the clavicle the instrument which protects the peritoneum, which is an instrument of wood or iron, and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a bowl. Its width should be according to the size of the bone, large or small, and its length also according to what is possible for the work. Let it have two ends, as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.
If the wound opening which you incised when removing the bone splinter is wide and you are sure there will be no hot inflammation, then join the edges of the wound with sutures. If the opening is small or you fear hot inflammation, then treat the wound with lint and pledgets according to the size of the incision.
If hot inflammation appears, then moisten the lint in rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it. As for setting the bone if it is without a wound or incision, it is to apply to the bone a plaster made from mill dust with egg white. And you place the soft splint upon it, then place the ball under his armpit if he needs it. Then take a bandage which is very long, and let its width be a cubit or thereabouts. Then apply a folded pledget upon the splint and the plaster, then take a splint from a thin board. Let its width be three fingers and its length likewise. Then enclose it in a cloth, then enclose that cloth with the splint in the part of the bandage which lies on the place of the fracture, then tighten the bandage on the fracture as you wind it. And pass it over his neck and under his sound armpit and under his injured armpit, and pass it repeatedly on each side, and as you see that the tightening fixes the fracture firmly, which is not hidden from you.
And the aim of all this is that the splint does not move from upon the broken bone. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the patient every day; whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, correct that and tighten the bandage. Then let the patient sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
So that his arm may be raised from his side, and the fracture of the clavicle may be raised with the raising of the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck. And do not loosen the bandage unless an incident occurs in the area, such as itching or swelling, until twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. And leave it bandaged until the fracture of the clavicle heals and consolidates, and it becomes stronger and firmer; this takes about twenty-eight days. And in some people it may be in less than that.
Chapter Six.
On the treatment of a fractured humerus. The humerus rarely fractures in its wide part; rather, it fractures at its extremities.  When a part of it is fractured, or it is fractured in its middle, this is known by touch. Then the treatment depends on the nature of the fracture.
Straighten it and restore it to its natural shape by any means you can, then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft tow, and place on top a pad of folded cloth, then apply a wide splint of wood.
Thin enough to cover the whole shoulder or slightly wider. If there is a lump under the splint at any part of the shoulder, smooth out that lump with soft tow until the splint lies evenly, then bind it from above with a long bandage.
Bind it tightly and make sure the splint does not move from its place. Check the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and straighten the splint if it has moved from its place. Let the patient lie on his sound side. The shoulder heals in twenty [days].
days or twenty-five days. When this time is complete, unbind the bandage, for you are safe, for it is among the bones which one does not fear will be crushed or dislocated. If a fragment of bone protrudes and is embedded under the skin, incise over it and remove it. And do what was mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle to soothe the hot swelling if anything of that happens.
Chapter Seven.
On the reduction of a fracture of the chest.
The chest may be fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens; but its extremities are more often fractured and shattered. Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, is that it inclines downwards, and there is intense pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing.
And sometimes blood is expelled, and the depression in the broken bone is evident and not hidden from the touch.  Its reduction is that the patient lies on his back, and a pillow is placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are compressed, and the ribs are brought together with the hands from both sides, and gentleness is used in straightening it in every way that is possible.
And continue until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be, then apply a bandage and a splint, and place over it a splint of a thin board of willow or elm or something similar that is light, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then gently bind it to the fractured bone lest it shift, and pass the bandage around to the back several times and tighten it firmly, then examine the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if necessity demands its removal because of inflammation that occurs at the site, or pain, or swelling, then proceed to remove it and take off the bandage, and treat what has occurred by its appropriate treatment, then reapply the bandage if you see reason for it. And face it and maintain the binding until it heals.
Chapter Eight.
Concerning the setting of ribs if they are fractured: Know that fractures of the ribs occur in the thick parts near the back, and their ends in front are subject to contusion because they are cartilaginous, and the knowledge of this is not hidden from the sense when examined with the fingers.
And set it by straightening the fracture with the fingers in the accessible way until the shape is straightened as it should be, then bandage and bind the broken bone with a splint if it needs that.  If the fracture of the ribs is angled inwards, then severe pain occurs to the patient.
And it penetrates like the penetration which occurs to someone with a puncture wound, because the bone penetrates the diaphragm, and shortness of breath, coughing and the ejection of much blood also occur to him, and this is difficult to treat, and the ancients devised many strategems for it.
And some of them said that it is necessary to make the patient's food that which produces flatulence and wind so that the abdomen swells and expands and the fracture is pushed outwards, and we dislike this lest it confirms the occurrence of hot inflammation if it has not occurred, and if it has occurred then it increases and confirms it.
And some of them said a cupping glass should be placed on the area then strongly sucked, and this is more similar to the measurement, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will draw impurities to the area due to its weakness, and some of them said that the area should be covered with wool dipped in hot oil.
And make a bandage between the ribs until it is full, so that the binding is even when you wrap it around, then treat the patient with the treatment of a puncture wound in food and medicine, if the patient is burdened by a severe matter that he cannot endure. And the bone penetrated the diaphragm with a harmful penetration, and we feared for the patient, therefore it is necessary that we incise the area and uncover the fractured rib, then place under it the instrument which protects the peritoneum, which was previously described, and gently cut the bone and remove it.
Then we bring together the edges of the wound if it is large by stitching and treat it with ointments until it heals, and if a hot inflammation appears in the meantime, then quickly wet bandages in rose oil, place them on the area and treat the patient with what calms the inflammation from the inside as well.
And he lies on the side on which sleep is easier for him until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
In the reduction of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture affects them—and this rarely happens to them, and what most often affects them is bruising, and likewise the vertebrae of the back also—if this happens to someone and you want to know whether he will recover or not. Then look, and if you see that his hands have become relaxed and numb and dead, and he is unable to move them, nor to extend nor to flex them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle he does not feel it and finds no pain in them, then know that in most instances he will not recover, and he is dying.
And if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking in them, then know that the marrow of the bone is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment.  If a similar thing affects the vertebrae of the back and you want to know whether he will recover also or not,
look at his legs; and if you see that they have become relaxed and what happened in the hands has happened in them, then if he lies on his back, wind and excrement come out involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily, and if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he cannot do so, then know that he is dying, so do not trouble yourself with his treatment; but if nothing of this happens to him, the matter is less serious. And the treatment of what has happened is that you try to alleviate the hot swelling.
by placing on the injured vertebra rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks; you should apply this three times a day, until the hot swelling subsides; then apply to the place one of the strengthening, drying compresses, and bind it tightly, and order him to keep still and quiet.
And let him not sleep except on the side where he feels no pain, until he recovers.  If, at the time of the injury, a splinter or something has broken off from the bone, then it is necessary to incise the skin and extract that bone. Then, if the wound is large, bring the edges together with sutures, then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the rump bone, is broken, then you should insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus.
And set the broken bone with the other hand, as far as you are able to achieve the setting, then apply the compress and splint if you need it, and then bind it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, then incise it and remove it, and treat the wound with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the reduction of a fracture of the hip.
Hip bones rarely fracture; but if they do fracture, it is in such a way that the ends are shattered and split lengthwise, and incline inwards.  The patient experiences pain in the area, and weakness and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.
Its reduction is that you pass your hand over it until you ascertain the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, then set that fracture according to what seems best to you in terms of setting, until its form resembles its natural form.
If the fracture is lengthwise, or if it has inclined inwards, then lay the patient on his stomach so that the reduction of that fracture becomes possible for you. When you have set it, apply a bandage to it, then apply a splint of wood or leather, and bind it tightly.
Do not fear for him that the fracture will shift or the splint will come loose.  Fill any hollows in the loins with material until the binding is even.  Instruct the patient to lie on his back or on his sound side. If he develops a hot swelling…
…then cease from setting and binding it until the hot swelling subsides. Apply something to soothe it, as previously described, then return to setting and binding it as is appropriate. If there are fragments or shattered pieces of bone at the ends, they should not be removed.
They should not be touched but smoothed from the outside, as we have said, and the binding should be left in place until healing occurs.
Chapter Eleven.
On the setting of a fractured humerus.
The humerus is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is fractured, it is set in one of two ways: one is to take a smooth, curved, moderately thick stick, in this shape:
And you tie two bandages to its ends, then it is hung from a high place, and the patient sits on a chair, then his broken arm is placed on the stick until his armpit is touching the middle of the curve of the stick, then something heavy is hung from above it.
Or a servant stretches it downwards, then the physician sets the fracture with his hands until he returns the fracture to what is appropriate.  The other method is that the patient lies on his back and his hand is hung from his neck with a bandage.
Then you order two servants, one to hold above the fracture with his hands and the other to hold below it, and each stretches to his side. And if you wish the stretching to be stronger, then tie below the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage, and each of the servants stretches to his side.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, then the middle of the bandage should be under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then the bandage should be in that place and on the elbow itself.
Then you set the fracture gently without violence, until the fracture is set as it should be and unites well. Then you bandage it if there is no hot swelling. If hot swelling appears, then leave bandaging until the seventh day and apply moistened wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then bandage it. The method of bandaging is to apply the compress to the fracture, then apply a bandage of new cloth over the compress, then bring the arm towards the upper arm itself and place the hand open on the shoulder.
And you apply the cloth and bandage to the upper arm and forearm so that the arm acts as a splint, if nothing prevents you and nothing changes in the broken bone. If you fear that something might change, then use splints.
This is to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, and let there be the width of a finger between each splint.  Let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
Then you bandage the splints with the bandage mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And that your bandaging of the fracture site should be tighter.
And the further from the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be. If you see that the placement of the splints and the bandaging as we have said is appropriate when you set the limb immediately, then do so.
And if you fear a hot inflammation, leave off the bandaging and splints until the seventh day, as we have said. Then examine the bandage every three days, lest there be chafing or swelling at the site, or the nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb because of excessive tightness.  Correct all this as we have mentioned.
But if you are confident that none of this will occur, do not untie the bandage except after many days.  And let the patient lie on his back with his hand on his stomach, and a moderately full cushion of wool be placed under the arm.
And examine at all times, night and day, lest the shape of the broken limb be disturbed or the bandage loosen. Correct all this with your effort, and let the patient's diet be of the kind we have described previously, that the food be light at first until the bone begins to harden.
Then it is necessary to make his food more substantial. For it is the nature of the arm and leg to harden in forty days. Then it is necessary to untie [the bandage], and he should use the bath and be treated with ointments suitable for this. If the fracture is severe and comminuted,
then do not untie the bandage from him until fifty days or even two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called the ulna. One is small, and it is that which is next to the thumb; and the other is large, and it is situated under the small one from below.  Perhaps the larger ulna is broken alone, or the smaller one alone, or perhaps both are broken together.
And when the smaller upper ulna is broken, then its setting is easy, and its healing is quicker. And when the lower ulna is broken, then its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult. And the worst is if the two bones are broken together. If the bone which is broken is the smaller upper ulna,
then it is necessary for the physician, when setting it, to make its extension easy gently until he sets it straight.  And if the large ulna is that which is broken, then it is necessary to make its extension stronger. And if both ulnas are broken, then it is necessary to make the extension much stronger.
And it is necessary that the shape of the hand, when it is set and extended, is extended on a cushion, and the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should sit squarely on his seat.
And let the cushion be opposite him in height, lest the patient suffer difficulty.
Then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another servant extends from above likewise. Then the physician sets the bone until he returns it to the best shape he can.  If there are splinters in the fracture of the bone, then they are removed.
Return each splinter to its place to the best of your ability. If a splinter appears that is separated and is piercing the skin and there is no hope of setting it, then make an incision upon it and extract it in the manner which we mentioned previously. If the fracture is with a wound, then it has been given a separate chapter.
Then take its treatment from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of your setting, then apply a cloth with a poultice made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be moderate between thickness and thinness, and bind the cloth upon it gently until the swelling subsides.
Then remove the poultice and apply the prepared bandage of mill dust with egg white. Then apply the splints, and let the splint which is placed upon the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger. And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases.
Whether the fracture was in one ulna or in both ulnas together, then make your binding at the place of the fracture stronger and tighter, and whenever you move the binding upwards or downwards, make the binding a little looser, as previously mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths which are wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, and not very hard. And let the thread with which it is bound be of fine linen, moderate between thinness and thickness, as we described. And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days.
If something happens that needs to be corrected, such as itching that appears in the limb, then the limb should be bathed with warm water until that itching subsides, and the limb should be left unbandaged for a night so that it rests, then the binding should be resumed.
If the binding has loosened and the bone has shifted or something like that, then repair all that to the best of your ability. And look also, if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb because of excessive binding, then it should be loosened a little and left for a few days until nourishment flows to it, then bind it.
If nothing of what we mentioned occurs to the patient, then it should not be unbound except after twenty days or so. Then suspend the patient's hand to his neck, and let his arm be straight. He should take care to avoid restless movements, and let him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days; all that according to the conditions of the temperaments and conditions of strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of a fracture of the hand and fingers.
Fractures of the metacarpus and phalanges rarely occur, but contusions frequently do.  Therefore, when a fracture or contusion occurs in the hand…
The patient should sit cross-legged, with a chair directly in front, level with him.
Then he should place his hand upon it, extended. Then the bones are extended by the assistant, and the surgeon sets them until they are properly joined. Then, if no hot inflammation occurs, a bandage and splint should be applied; and then a further splint is applied over it according to the location.
And it is placed in a soft cloth. If the fracture is towards the palm, make a kind of ball from a cloth and have the patient grasp it with his broken hand, then bind it tightly with a long cloth.
The splint should be of soft leather, so that it conforms to the skin with the flexion of the whole hand, and is bound as necessary. If the fracture is outward, the splint should be placed above and another below, in the hand, so that the hand remains open and straight.
Then the binding is applied as the hand turns, and the fingers are interwoven with the bandage. If the fracture is in one of the finger joints, if it is the thumb, it should be set properly and then bound with the hand; and if you wish, you may make a small, upright splint to support the fracture.
It should not be moved. If the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, it should be set and bound with the next sound finger, or all bound together, which is best, or a small, upright splint is applied.
As we said for the thumb, and observe during and after your setting for hot swelling, and counter it appropriately when anything of that occurs, as has been repeatedly described.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the setting of a fractured thigh.
The thigh bone is frequently fractured and is apparent to the touch because it moves forwards and backwards.  Its treatment is to tighten a bandage above the fracture and another below it, the patient lying on his face.
Then each bandage is extended to its side evenly. This is if the fracture is in the middle of the bone, but if it is near the head of the femur, then a soft bandage should be applied, either of wool or similar.
At the head of the femur towards the pubis so that the extension is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee so that the extension is downwards. Then the physician straightens the bone with both hands until he restores it to its natural shape.
And the bone unites well. Then the bandage and tightening should be maintained, unless a hot inflammation occurs in the limb. If inflammation occurs, leave it for some days until the hot inflammation subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for its tightening, a firm, wide turban should be wound twice or thrice around the fracture, leaving the excess. Then the leg is bent until the heel reaches the ischium, and a long thread is inserted between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, the ends of the thread being above on both sides.
Then you wind the remainder of the turban around the leg and thigh. Then you place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and one splint on the leg bone. Then stuff the space between the thigh and leg with soft rags so that the tightening is even.
Then begin strong tightening from the middle at the site of the fracture, three or four turns.  The further the bandage is from the site of the fracture, the less tight, softer, and looser should be the tightening.
Then take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie them to the splints above. Then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the heel, and with them also tighten the ends of the splints on the other side.
So that the bandage does not move from its place. Then leave the tightening as long as no pain, swelling, or puffiness, etc., occurs in the limb. If any of that happens, quickly untie it and correct what has occurred, as we have repeatedly mentioned.
If there is a protruding bone splinter, it should be aligned if possible. Otherwise, incise over it, remove it, and treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.  This fracture of the thigh may be set without adding splints to the leg.
As we mentioned in the case of the humerus and forearm, except that setting it in this way does not cause lameness for the patient. But if it is set alone, without adding the leg, the patient will inevitably be lame.
Know that the thigh heals in fifty days, or a little more or less, all depending on the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the fracture of the kneecap.
Fracture of the kneecap is rare, but contusion is frequent. If a fracture occurs, it is either a fissure or a shattering into fragments, and this may occur with or without a wound.
You will ascertain all this by touch, and you will reduce it by aligning the separated fragments with your fingers until they are joined and united, as far as the setting, gentleness and precision allow. Then you will apply a bandage, and a circular splint if necessary.
You will tighten it with a suitable bandage above, and then you will treat all the conditions which we have described in other fractures, such as hot swelling, etc., by counteracting each symptom with the appropriate remedy until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the reduction of fractures of the leg.
The leg has two bones; one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula.  They are subject to the same types of fracture as the bones of the arm. Therefore, its treatment is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are fractured, the leg will be displaced in all directions; if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg will be displaced forward; and if the thicker bone is fractured, and this happens lower down, then it is something that is not hidden from you.
Therefore use extension and reduction, and apply splints accordingly, except that if the fracture of the leg is severe with many fragments, the extension should be less and gentler, and you should take great care in its treatment.
And in the case of the leg, there is something additional to the treatment of the arm: when you have straightened the limb and completed all your work, take two thin strips of pine wood, the kind used in smoothing rooms, which are placed between the cracks in the planks, or they can be made from palm leaves or the like.
Choose those which are of moderate thickness, not too thin, and let their length be equal to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.  Then wrap each one with two layers of cloth along its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side.
Let them extend from the knee to the bottom of the foot. Then bind the splints in three places, at the ends and in the middle; by this means the leg is prevented from tilting to the right or left, and is well supported. A wooden gutter along the length of the leg may also be used.
It is placed within it to keep it from moving; this is especially necessary in fractures accompanied by a wound. Then examine the leg each day, and give it the most careful attention in regard to swelling, inflammation, or anything else. If anything of this sort occurs, counteract it appropriately until it heals.  The bone of the leg unites in about thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
On fractures of the bones of the leg and toes.
As for the heel, fracture never occurs; as for the bones of the leg, fracture may occur; and as for the toes, fracture rarely occurs, but contusion is more common.
If a fracture occurs in the bones of the leg, and you see that some of those bones overlap, then let the patient place his foot on the ground upright as if walking, and then you place your foot on the elevated part of those bones and press down on it and straighten it.
until they return to their places; then apply a bandage and splint from above, and place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot; then bind the foot tightly after wrapping it with cloths and whatever else is needed.
If three or four days pass, then untie the bandage, for you will find the bones straight, whether they were fractured or dislocated.  The procedure is as you see.  As for if some of the toes are fractured, set them and straighten them according to what I described to you in setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the fractured toe, along the length of the toe and slightly wider than it, and place under the foot the board I described to you and bind it tightly. If two, three, or more bones are fractured,
then make for each toe a splint of appropriate size, placed in soft cloth, and tighten the board at the bottom of the foot, with each end of the board projecting beyond the sole of the foot for a good hold.
You should not forget to attend to all that we mentioned to you in other fractures, from the symptoms we mentioned, and treat each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of the woman's pubis and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, seat her cross-legged, then gently bend her backwards. Let her be held from behind, then let the midwife pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and forms a ball within her vulva.
Then the woman is shaken and her loins are raised little by little.  The cotton will then come out until it is at the opening of the vulva like a ball, and the fractured bone will return to its place. Then place a pad on her back. When she wants to urinate, remove the cotton gently so that she can urinate.
And replace it in the way it was initially inserted, then return to the first pad. Do this for seven days or so, for then it will heal. If you wish, you can take a sheep's bladder, tie a reed tube to its mouth, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Then blow forcefully into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva; the fracture will then return to its place. Then pack it with cotton and proceed as described until it heals. As for a fracture of the pubic bone in a man or woman, the same treatment is used for its reduction.
And its treatment is as we described for a fracture of the hip. The correct treatment for these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, especially for someone experienced and who understands this book well, is not hidden, because the fracture itself usually indicates the treatment.
Understand the correct way to reduce and bind it.  As for a fractured penis, take a goose's windpipe, insert the penis into it, then apply a bandage of cloth, bind it, and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the reduction of fractures when accompanied by a wound.
If a fracture occurs with a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus, or similar, one should immediately perform bloodletting if the conditions for bloodletting, as we have previously explained, are present.
If the wound is bleeding, one should immediately stop it by applying powdered vitriol if nothing else is available. Then, reduce the fracture on that same day and do not delay.
If no hot inflammation occurs, then leave the reduction until the ninth day until the hot inflammation subsides. Do not attempt it on the third or fourth day at all, for this will lead to bad consequences.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin, one should try to reposition and straighten it gently by hand with a slight pull. If you are unable to reposition and straighten it by hand, reposition it with this instrument; it is an instrument made of iron, seven or eight fingers in length. And its width should be according to the wound.
Therefore, the physician should have three or four of them, according to the need for treatment in each type of fracture. Let them be round, with a slight thickness, lest they bend when pressed during use.
And let the tip be sharp, with a curve at its end; the upper part should be thicker, and from the middle to the lower part, much thinner.  This is its image:
And it is called in Greek *peron*, meaning a small lever.  Its sharp, curved end should be placed against the end of the protruding bone and pushed with it until the bone returns and becomes somewhat straight; then, align the ends of the fracture with each other.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grasp it well, then the end of that bone should be cut until the instrument can grasp it. If you are unable to reset the bone as we described, then cut it with a similar cut to those which we have mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws, however you can, then remove any roughness and thin flakes remaining on the bone. If, after resetting it, the patient feels severe, troublesome pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can reset it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient. When you have completed the setting of the bone, dip a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if it is summer, and do not apply a poultice or anything containing fat to the wound.
Lest putrefaction and corruption occur in it. Then, apply splints when you have finished setting the bone, and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to bind the wound tightly with the fracture, for many ignorant physicians have done this, causing their patients either death, or gangrene, or tetanus. Let your binding be loose and relaxed, unlike the binding of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he feels troublesome pain in the place, then you should not apply splints, but make him bandages of firm cloths in place of the splints, and bind him with them.
If after a day or two you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, remove the cloth that you placed on it with the drink, then use lint and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the tetrapharmacon and the like, and you should loosen the bandage.
And examine the wound every day, evening and morning, until it heals and is cured.  It is necessary to position the limb so that the pus flows down easily. If many days pass and the wound does not unite, and the pus does not cease, then know that there are small fragments of bone.
Then you should probe the wound.  Whatever of those fragments is loose, extract and remove it; and whatever is not loose, and is piercing the limb and causing pain, then strive to cut and remove it by any means you can.
If the wound shows signs of inflammation, or ulceration, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then you should counter each symptom with a similar treatment to that previously described in its chapter.
And what you should pay attention to and keep in mind is that if a large bone is broken and protrudes from a limb, such as the femur, humerus, and similar large limbs, do not attempt to pull it or extract it. For death often results from such an action. Rather, leave it until it putrefies, for perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
In the treatment of complications that occur after some fractures.
This complication often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially those near the joints, making the limb unsightly and perhaps preventing the limb from its natural function.
Examine it; if the complication is soft, use astringent medicines such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, gum tragacanth, acacia, and the like. Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent syrup, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply it to the complication in a bandage and bind it tightly. Leave the bandage on for many days, then remove it and reapply another until the complication is gone, God willing, or bind a tight lead plate on it.
For lead has the property of removing whatever is superfluous in the limbs. If the complication has become hardened and severe, and removal is necessary, incise it from above and cut away the excess growth, or shave it off with some instrument until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On the treatment of a fracture if it heals, and the limb remains thin and not as it was originally.
If a bone fracture heals and the limb remains thin and weak, this is due to many causes. One is excessive loosening and tightening of the bandages in an improper manner; another is excessive tightening of the bandages to the point that nourishment cannot reach the limb; another is excessive and repeated manipulation; another is excessive movement at the wrong time; and another is a deficiency of blood in the patient's body and his weakness.
The treatment of this is to nourish the patient and strengthen his body so that his blood increases, and to use baths and to make him happy and joyful and so on, then applying pitch to the limb so that the pitch draws much nourishment to it, or repeatedly manipulating it with lukewarm water. until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
In the treatment of fractured bones which have healed crookedly and are prevented from functioning properly.
When a member that has healed after being set shows a crookedness or a projection of the fractured bone, or a complication, and the appearance of the member is thereby disfigured. However, if the member does not impede its natural function, then one should not accept the opinion of those who claim that the member should be broken from the head, as many ignorant physicians and bone-setters in our country have done.
And this action is utterly reprehensible, leading to great danger, easily resulting in harm; but if the crookedness and complication are recent, then it should be softened with water in which emollient herbs have been boiled, such as mallow leaves and root, and royal crown, and the like.
And it should be bandaged with emollient poultices, like skillfully made diachylon, or the sap of mallow root should be taken and pounded with chicken fat and goose grease and applied as a bandage, or ripe figs should be taken and pounded with pigeon droppings and similar medicines which are called inhibitors of consolidation.
And the complication may be resolved by constant, gentle rubbing with the hands, and the movement of the member in every direction at all times should be employed; but if the crookedness is old and severe and hardened, and treatment with iron is necessary.
Then it should be incised above and the connection of the bone released, and what remains of the complication or bone should be cut with delicate incisions, and gentleness should be employed with effort and care, then the wound should be treated as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter twenty-three.
A dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, which impedes movement, disfigures the member, and causes the patient severe pain and suffering.  Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, one should immediately proceed to reduce it.
One should not delay at all, for if he delays, the place will swell and become inflamed, making reduction of the dislocation difficult. Therefore, one should not delay, nor move nor stretch it while it is swollen, because this often causes the patient spasms and harmful pains.
But if that happens, one should immediately bleed the patient, then leave him until the swelling subsides somewhat, then bathe the member with warm water and oil, then reduce it gently, and treat each member as described in its place.
The chapters on dislocations are also arranged, as in fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Rarely do both jaws dislocate; their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced and relax a little, or they are completely dislocated so that they relax. toward the chest, so that the saliva of the patient flows and he cannot retain it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stumbles in speech. But if the dislocation is slight, it often returns of its own accord very easily.
But if the dislocation is complete, it should be reduced quickly and not delayed at all.  A servant should hold the patient's head, and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
Or he should insert both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and the rest of his fingers from outside to level them. He should instruct the patient to relax his jaw and release it to go to each side, and the physician should level the jaw and push it until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, use a warm water and oil compress until their reduction is facilitated. Do not delay their reduction at all, as we said. When they return and are level, and the patient's mouth is closed and does not relax, then apply compresses with a mixture of wax, oil, and rosewater.
Then bind gently with a loose bandage. The patient should sleep on his back with his head elevated between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or left, and he should not strain to chew anything, but his food should be soft gruel.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is set, let him eat whatever he wants, but let him use it gently and not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, or yawning, until the jaw is set and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, fevers and persistent headaches often result from this, and perhaps the patient's abdomen will become distended, and perhaps he will vomit pure bile. If you see this, know that it is corrupted.
And many die from what has befallen them within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On the reduction of a dislocated clavicle and shoulder point.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side because of its connection to the chest.  It may, however, dislocate outwards, and this is evident to the touch. Its treatment is that the patient should lie on his back and extend his arms.
Then press the area firmly with your hand, and it will return. Then apply a bandage and splints and bind it tightly. As for the end which is next to the shoulder and connected to it, it rarely dislocates; but if it should dislocate sometime, then it should be reduced and set as we have mentioned and as seems best to you.
Then apply a bandage and splints and bind it tightly, and instruct the patient to remain quiet and still until it heals. By this same treatment you reduce the shoulder point if it also leaves its place.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On the reduction of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one, that it dislocates toward the armpit, downward; the second, that it dislocates toward the chest; and sometimes it dislocates above the shoulder, and this is rare.
It does not dislocate to the rear, because of the shoulder blade, nor does it dislocate to the front, because of the nerve.  Most often it dislocates and comes out downwards toward the armpit, especially in those whose flesh is thin, because it comes out and goes in quickly in them.
But as for those whose flesh is abundant, it is otherwise, I mean that it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty.  And sometimes a blow or a fall happens to some people, and the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, so he thinks that it has dislocated.  It is necessary to examine that until you ascertain its truth.
Then you proceed in its treatment.  And the dislocation is recognized if it is downward toward the armpit: if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the sound shoulder, you will find a clear difference between them, and you will find the head of the shoulder in it crooked, and under the armpit, upon touching, the head of the shoulder as if it were an egg.
And the patient is not able to raise his hand to his ear, nor to move it in all movements.  Likewise, if it dislocates toward the chest or upward, you find that apparent to the touch, it is not hidden.
And this dislocation is easy to reduce if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  Its reduction is that a servant raises his hand upward, then you place the thumbs of your hands under his armpit and raise the joint forcefully upward to its place, and the servant raises his hand and extends it upward.
Then he lowers it downward, for it returns quickly. If it does not return by what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been for many days, then it is necessary that the patient bathe in hot water and use things that relax and soften, such as cooking the root of marshmallow, fenugreek, and rue in water, and use it.
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool that is moderate between softness and firmness. Then the physician places his heel on the ball and grasps the patient's hand with his hand and extends it downward.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, then it returns to its place. And if you wish, reduce it in this way: you bring a taller man than the patient and station him at the side, and he puts his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raises his armpit upward until the patient is suspended in the air. And another servant pulls the patient's hand down to his belly. If the patient is light, then it is necessary to suspend something else on him to weigh him down, for then the jaw returns immediately. And it may also be reduced in another way.
And that is to firmly place in the ground a long piece of wood, its head round in shape like the pestle of a mortar, neither thick nor thin, then it is placed under the patient's armpit, after placing a soft rag on the head of the wood, and the patient stands along the wood.
Then you extend his hand downwards from the other side, and he extends his body also from the other side forcefully, then the joint returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult to reduce it by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment: you take a piece of wood about two cubits long. And its width is the size of four fingers and its thickness the size of two fingers. It has a round head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the armpit in this manner:.
Then a soft rag is tied to the round head, lest the wood harm the patient. Then it is placed under the armpit, and the whole hand and arm are extended on the wood downwards, and the wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a crossbar.  The body is supported horizontally, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side. Then the joint enters immediately. If it enters in any way possible, then a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared bandage of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the whole shoulder as it rotates from above. Then the ball is firmly tightened from under the armpit, and the bandage is rotated over the bandage from above, and his hand is hung around his neck.
He is left without moving his hand for seven days, and the patient's food should be reduced so that the limb may strengthen, for this is quicker for its healing. Then, after seven or five days, it is untied and exercised. If it is firm and does not relax, then it is healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to dampness or another cause, then cauterization with three cautery irons should be used, as previously described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days, and the joint is not stable,
the bandage and tightening were repeated many times, but it did not stabilize, and it fell and relaxed, and you were unable to raise it upwards, then know that the nerve in the head of the humerus has been severed, stretched, or relaxed. Then know that the joint will never be stable in its place.
As for the fracture that occurs towards the chest and breast and to the back, its reduction is by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns.  All the binding and treatment are used until it heals. If, after healing, there is stiffness in the limb and slowness of movement,
let the patient use the bath many times until that stiffness softens and returns to its former nature.
Chapter twenty-seven.
In the treatment of fracture of the elbow.
The elbow joint is difficult to dislocate and also difficult to reduce.  It dislocates in all directions, especially forwards or backwards. Its dislocation is not hidden from you, because it is visible and palpable, whichever way it is dislocated.
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one, this will be clearly apparent to you by the deformity of the joint; and he cannot bend the arm nor touch his shoulder with it. You should act quickly and reduce the dislocation at once, before a hot inflammation occurs.
For if a hot inflammation occurs, reduction is difficult, and it may not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backwards; for this is the worst of all types of dislocation, and the most painful, and often death follows.
And its reduction, if it is possible to reduce it, is done by an assistant extending his arm with both hands, and the physician's hands above and below the elbow, he pushing the joint with both thumbs, or with the heel of his hands, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is forwards, it may be reduced by bending the arm forcibly until the heel of the hand strikes the opposite shoulder. If the dislocation does not reduce, employ strong traction, that is to say, let two assistants extend the arm.
And let two assistants also hold the patient, lest he move during the traction. Then the arm is rotated in every direction after a folded cloth or a broad bandage has been wrapped around the hand; and when the physician touches the joint with his hands, let him anoint them with oil, so that the joint may slip easily.
Then he pushes the joint forcibly until it returns. After its reduction, a bandage should be applied which produces constriction and drying, with white of egg, and it should be tightly bound, and the arm suspended from the patient's neck, and left for some days.
Then it is unbound; if the joint is firm in its place, unbind it and leave it.  But if you see that the joint is not yet firm, reapply the bandage and binding, and leave it also for some days until it becomes firm, then unbind it. If a swelling occurs after the reduction of the joint and its unbinding,
and there is difficulty in movement, let him use fomentations in the bath, and gentle rubbing and manipulation until it softens; or apply to the joint a piece of fat mutton, then bind it and leave it on for a day and a night, then remove it and put him in the bath; when he has perspired, rub the joint moderately.
Then reapply the fat mutton once, twice, and three times, with the bath, until it softens. And if you wish to apply to it fresh, light cow dung with fat and bind it on, do so repeatedly, for it softens and returns to its former condition.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist is frequently dislocated, and its reduction is easier than that of other joints; however, it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the time it is dislocated, before the part becomes swollen or a hot swelling appears.
Its reduction is to place the patient's wrist on a board, and the attendant extends his hand.  The physician places his hand on the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns; however, it is necessary to see if the dislocation has gone to the inside of the hand.
If the dislocation is towards the outside of the hand, let the patient place the palm of his hand on the board during extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is prominent towards the back of the hand, let the back of his hand be placed on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the same prominence of the joint. If it returns immediately, well and good; otherwise, bind it with a bandage that soothes the swelling.
And leave it; do not manipulate it again, for it will not tolerate it, and you will not be able to reduce it after a few days have passed, except that the joint will remain dislocated, and this will not harm the patient, except if the hand becomes weak and unable to grasp anything.
Then you know that the nerve has been severed or bruised; there is no remedy for this except cauterization, which may or may not be effective.  When the reduction of the wrist is complete, apply the bandage we have described, then bind it tightly and leave it for five days.
Then unbind it and exercise the hand. If its movement is difficult and there is any stiffness, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it becomes supple.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may be dislocated in any direction. If a finger is dislocated towards the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns to place. Then bind the end of the finger and suspend it towards the direction in which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it is straight that day. If it is at night, bind it in the same way; continue to unbind it during the day, exercising it with movement, and bind it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; bind it towards that same direction and do as you did before until it heals.  Do likewise if it is dislocated in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
If a vertebra of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or if many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment, for death quickly overtakes the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's stool is involuntarily passed; he cannot retain it, and often some of his limbs, either his legs or arms, or one of them, become relaxed. But if only one vertebra is displaced from its position, it often returns to its place.
And its displacement is in four directions. That which is displaced backward is called a hump. As for its treatment, if the hump has occurred from childhood, there is no treatment for it, nor any cure at all.  But that which occurs from a fall, a blow, or the like…
The ancients have mentioned it with various treatments in lengthy descriptions, most of which are not beneficial. I have shortened this, and what little I have included suffices for much of what they brought, by my approximation to the meaning and my explanation of it, and I have depicted the instrument differently from what they explained and described.
I say that the hump which occurs in the front of the chest has no remedy nor cure, and the same applies to that which occurs to the sides as well.  Only that which occurs in the back is treatable, in the way I describe, which is that you extend the patient on his face.
on a level bench near a wall, and spread a wet mat beneath him so that his chest is not harmed. Then place an upright plank, fixed in a hole in the ground at the head end of the bench towards his head, and another plank towards his feet at the other end of the bench.
And a servant holds the plank—let it not be firmly fixed in the hole—and another servant holds the other in that manner. Then wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft, tight bandage, and extend the end of the bandage to the plank at his head and tie it there.
Then tighten with another bandage above his hips, above his knees, and at his ankles. Then gather all the bandages and tie them to the other plank at his feet. Then each servant pulls on his plank with the bandage, and the planks do not move from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not fixed, as we said. And the physician places his hands on the hump forcefully until it returns, or he places a board on it, then he leans on the board with his feet until it returns.  If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board about three cubits long.
and make a hole in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, into which the end of the board is inserted. Then place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls strongly until the hump is compressed.
and it returns to its place. And if you wish to make it with a hand-twisted screw, then plant two planks in the ground at the head of the patient at the far end of the shop, a cubit long, and at his feet at the far end of the shop also two planks.
Let the distance between each plank be a span. And a hole is made in each plank through which the screw passes. And all the wood is firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all. And insert a round rod, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two planks.
And at its end is a hole in which a rod a cubit long is fixed with what is twisted. And in the other two planks similarly. Then tighten the bandage which you tightened on the chest of the patient in the screw which is at his head, and the bandages which you tightened on his legs in the screw which is at his feet.
Then a servant stands at each screw, twisting his hand with the instrument which twists the screw, and the physician straightens the hump as we have explained. And this is an image of the screw, the shop and the patient:
Then after the vertebra returns and the place is straightened, it is necessary to apply a drying compress with egg white, then a splint, and then to place on top of the compress a splint of wood, its width being three fingers or so, and its length being sufficient to cover the place of the hump.
And on some sound beads, then it is bound with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers. If some swelling remains in the place at the end of the healing, then it is necessary to use softening and relaxing medicines along with the use of the splint which we described for a long time.
And a lead plate may be used in that. And a swelling may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation, and it may be an extra bone that has grown. Do not treat this with this treatment, for death may result.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and they are not subject to what happens to other joints of slight displacement and depression, and the hip joint is dislocated in four ways.
That is, it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards, and most often it is dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards, and the sign of its dislocation inwards is that if you compare the sound leg of the patient with the affected one, it will be longer.
And the knee will be more prominent than the sound one, and the patient will not be able to bend his leg at the groin, and the area next to the groin will be clearly swollen because the head of the femur has gone there.
And the sign of that which is dislocated outwards is that its symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms, and the sign of that which is dislocated forwards is that he extends his leg completely, but he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he tries to walk, he cannot do so forwards.
And he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when walking, he treads on his heel, and the sign of that which is dislocated backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
And the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly at the position of the loin, and as for the reduction of the types of this dislocation, it is that you should look, for if the dislocation is old, having remained with its possessor for a long time and he has not attempted to reduce it and it has remained in its state, then there is absolutely no treatment for it.
Then it should not be treated, and as for the one whose dislocation is recent, and whatever type it is of the four types of dislocation, then hasten to twist the joint and stretch it inwards and outwards, and move it right and left, perhaps...
it returned and did not need any other treatment. If it does not return like this, then you should prepare a strong and helpful assistant who stretches his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied around his leg above the knee, and another assistant who stretches it from above.
so that he puts his hands under his armpits, then he tightens a soft bandage around the base of the thigh, and another third assistant holds the end of the bandage, and the stretching is either from the front from the groin to the clavicle, or from behind to the back.
And their stretching is all at once until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains suspended.  For this type of stretching is a common type for the four types. If the dislocation returns as we said, otherwise, each type needs what I mention of specific treatment.
As for its specific reduction, if the dislocation is inwards, then the patient should lie on his sound side, then a bandage is applied to the base of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the area under the groin.
Then the bandage is stretched upwards from the groin to the upper body towards the clavicle, then another strong and helpful assistant takes it with his arms and embraces the thick part of the affected thigh and stretches outwards with a strong pull, then it returns to its place.
And this type is easier than the other types of treatment by which this member is reduced. If it is difficult for you and it does not respond to this type of treatment at all, then the patient's legs should be tied together with a strong, soft bandage on the heels and knees.
And the distance between each one and its neighbor is four fingers, and the affected leg is extended more than the other by two fingers. Then the patient is suspended by the head from a wooden beam in the house, and his distance from the ground is two cubits.
Then you order a strong boy to embrace the head of the femur, and another boy hangs onto the patient, and the other boy embracing the femur pushes strongly, then the joint returns to its place quickly. As for its specific reduction if the dislocation is outwards.
The patient should lie on the bench as we described for the hunchback, and a bandage is tightened on his affected leg and chest. Then two wooden beams are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head, then an additional beam is placed in the middle of the bench, very securely fastened.
A wet cloth is wrapped around it so that it does not harm the patient, so that the wooden beam is between his thighs so that he does not slip downwards when extended. Then each servant pulls to his side and the physician sets the hip with his hands, if it responds to reduction.
Otherwise, place the board on him and compress it as we mentioned in the case of the hunchback, except that the patient should lie on his healthy side. And if the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be extended while he is in this same position on the bench.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected groin, then presses it with the other hand, and with that extends the pressure downwards towards the knee. And if the dislocation is backward, then the patient should not be extended downwards.
And it is raised from the ground, but rather it should be placed on something solid, as it should also be if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we mentioned concerning his lying on the bench, and he is on his face and the bandages are tight.
As we said before, and the compression with the board should also be used on the place to which the joint has gone.  Then, if the hip joint is completely reduced as it should be, and the sign of its reduction will not be hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's legs.
Then if you see them level and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the member has returned as it should. Then, bring the thighs together, apply the bandage, and bind it with a turban tightly so that the hip does not move in any direction.
And the patient must remain still for three or four days. Then untie the bandage and compare the leg with the other. If you see them equal in size, know that the reduction has been successful, and allow the patient to walk. And if you see any laxity in it…
then return and bandage it and tighten it according to your first tightening, and also leave it for three days, then untie it, and he should walk slowly on it for days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter thirty-two.
In the treatment of the reduction of the knee.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inwards, outwards, and downwards, that is, backwards; it does not dislocate forwards at all. And the sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to press his leg to his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated.  The treatment of all types of its dislocation is that you seat the patient sitting with his legs extended if he is able to do so, and a servant sits behind him to hold his waist and twist him slightly backwards, then you sit on his thighs.
And you place your back against his face and place his leg between your legs, then you grasp his knee with your hands and interlock them between your fingers on his knee, then you press with your hands the sides of his knee strongly, and another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh softly without force. Then bandage it and adhere the leg to the thigh, then bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release them. And he should only use a little walking for some days until it strengthens.
If it is difficult for you to return it by what we have described, then use strong traction with the bandages that I previously described in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In the treatment of the dislocation of the heel.
The heel may be dislocated slightly, and it may be completely dislocated.  Its dislocation is either inward or outward, and the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and prominent in the direction in which it dislocated.
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to return it;  he should gently stretch it with his hands and straighten it until it returns. As for its treatment if it is completely dislocated, then it is necessary that you seat the patient sitting, and a strong servant holds him from behind his back at his waist.
Then you grasp his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below his foot at the place of the heel. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with the left twice, then straighten it with the left and push the front of the foot with the right towards the leg without force.
Do this twice as we have described, then push the front of the foot to the leg on the third occasion while you pull at the heel. If it returns in one or two times in this manner and you see the foot straight, otherwise repeat the action on it, for it will return.
If it refuses to return as we have described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and firmly plant a wooden peg in the ground so that it lies between his thighs, having wrapped a cloth around it lest it injure the patient. Then a servant should hold his thigh.
Then another servant stretches the leg, either with his hands or with a rope that he ties around the neck of the leg. Then each servant stretches in the opposite direction to his companion, the peg remaining between the patient's thighs, holding it so that his body is not pulled downwards during the stretching. Then the physician straightens the joint with his hands.
And another servant holds the healthy leg below, for the joint returns quickly. When the joint returns and you see that its return is correct, apply the compress and bandage and tighten it with firm bandages and bind the foot with the bandage below. It is necessary to protect the nerve which is above the heel from behind.
lest the bandage be too tight and injure him. Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it, then loosen it on the third or fourth day. And the patient must abstain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this time, you cannot be sure that the joint will not become dislocated and spoiled, and will not then accept treatment. If a hot swelling appears, then you should use what we have previously described in other places for its treatment and poulticing until it disappears.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
In the treatment of the dislocation of the toes of the foot.
You should set what has been dislocated with a gentle pull without force; this is not difficult, but easy. If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the instep, then the patient should place his foot on a level surface.
Or on a board while he is standing like one walking; then you place your foot on the dislocated joint, and then press down on it firmly until it returns and you see that it is straight, and no prominence appears in the place.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot which takes the whole foot, having two ends, then bind it tightly and firmly for three days, then unbind it and keep him from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are safe from recurrence, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation which occurs with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both together.
When something of that happens and you attempt its treatment and setting, it frequently results in death.
Therefore, no one should undertake the treatment of such a thing except one who is skillful in the art, long experienced, gentle, compassionate, careful, not rash nor impetuous, and that he use in the beginning only those medicines which calm hot swellings and leave the patient alone.
By God's power, except that for which you hope for safety from harm with mildness of the disease, and some hope appears to you in it, then return it at once in the first instance before the hot swelling occurs.
If the member returns as you wish, then use the treatment which calms hot swellings and treat the wound with what is suitable for it of drying ointments; if the dislocation is with a fracture and there occur in the bone separated fragments, then remove them. And observe in that what we mentioned in the simple illnesses, what preceded in their places.
And strive your best and refrain from entering the path of risk, as I have previously advised you, for that is more lasting for your reputation and safer for your honor, God willing.
