The author of this book said: When I had completed for you, my son, this book, which is the theoretical part of medicine in its entirety, and reached the limit in its clarity and explanation, I decided to complete it for you with this treatise, which is the practical part, done by hand.
Because surgery in our country and in our time is totally nonexistent, so that its science has almost been forgotten and its trace obliterated.
There remain of it only insignificant traces in the books of the ancients, which have been corrupted by copyists and marred by errors and confusion, so that its meanings have become obscure and its benefit remote.
So I decided to revive it and compose this treatise by way of explanation, clarification, and conciseness, and to include illustrations of cauteries and other surgical instruments, as this adds to the clarity and covers what is needed.
The reason why there is no skilled surgeon in our time is because the study of medicine is long, and its practitioner should first train in the science of anatomy which Galen described.
Until he understands the functions of the organs, their structures, temperaments, connections, and separations, and the knowledge of bones, nerves, and muscles, their number and origins, and the pulsating and non-pulsating veins, and the locations of their origins.
Therefore Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the practice of surgery.  We have mentioned some of this in the introduction of this book.
Because whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have mentioned regarding anatomy will inevitably fall into an error that kills people, as I have witnessed many who dabbled in this science and claimed it without knowledge or understanding.
For I saw an ignorant physician incise a scrofulous tumor on the neck of a woman, and he severed some of the arteries of the neck, so the woman bled until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician proceed to extract a bladder stone from an old man; the stone was large, and he acted rashly and extracted it with a piece of the bladder wall.
So the man died after about three days. I had been summoned to extract it, but I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient what I had estimated about it.
I saw another physician who was earning a living from some of the police chiefs of our city by practicing medicine.
A black boy who was with him experienced a fracture in his leg near the heel, along with a wound. The physician, in his ignorance, quickly bandaged the fracture over the wound with compresses and splints, binding it tightly and leaving no ventilation for the wound.
Then he indulged his desires, then left him for several days and instructed him not to loosen the bandage.  Thus, his leg and foot swelled, and he was near death.
So I was called to him, and I quickly loosened the bandage. He found relief and his pains lessened, except that the corruption had taken hold in the limb, and I could not turn it back.
And the corruption continued to spread in the limb until he perished.
And I saw another physician treat a hard, cancerous tumor.  It ulcerated after a few days until the affliction of its owner worsened. This is because, if the cancer is purely from black bile humor, it should not be touched with iron at all.
Unless it is in a limb that can be entirely amputated.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two parts: work accompanied by safety and work accompanied by damage in most cases.
And I have pointed out, in every place where it occurs in this book, any procedure that involves risk and danger, so you should beware of it and reject it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to criticize and attack, adopt resolution and precaution for yourselves, and gentleness and deliberation for your patients.
And employ the best path leading to safety and a praiseworthy outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to treat.
And keep yourselves from anything you fear might bring suspicion upon your religion and your worldly life, for it is more preserving of your honor and more elevating of your status in this world and the next. 
Galen said in some of his advice, "Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be called bad physicians.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The First Chapter.
On cauterization with fire and cauterization with caustic medication, organized and arranged from the head to the foot, and illustrations of the instruments and cauterizing irons, and everything needed for the manual operation.
The Second Chapter.
On incision, and scarification, and phlebotomy, and cupping, and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and all similar things, organized and arranged, and illustrations of the instruments.
The Third Chapter.
On bone-setting, and dislocations, and the treatment of sprains, and similar things, organized and arranged from the head to the foot, and illustrations of the instruments.
