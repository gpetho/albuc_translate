This cautery is effective for moisture and coldness in the brain, and there are two types made for a disease called "soda", and for many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for the multitude of dreams, toothache, and sore throat, and especially for all diseases that come from coldness such as paralysis, soda, apoplexy, and similar diseases.	This cauterization helps against excessive humidity and coldness on the brain, which cause headache, abundance of defluxions from the head to the regions of the eyes and ears, excess of sleep, toothache, sore throat, and in general any sort of disorder arising from frigidity, such as palsy, fits, apoplexy, and diseases similar to these.	0.7088313
The method for this cautery is that the patient is purged by a laxative medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength, age, and habits of the patient can endure; then shave the patient’s head.	The manner of performing this operation is first to bid the patient open the bowels with an evacuant which will also clear his head, for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habits of the patient.	0.8484434
Then make him sit cross-legged with his hands on his chest; afterward place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle fingers rest, make an incision there and then heat the cautery called "olivare", which has this shape:	Then tell him to have his head shaved; then seat him cross-legged before you, with his hands on his breast. Then place the lower part of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes; and where your middle finger reaches mark that place with ink. Then heat an olivary cautery.	0.8389058
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it is cleansed; and for this reason it helps greatly.	The Ancients said that the more a wound is kept open, discharging pus, the better and more efficacious.	0.78577995
And some of them said that the cautery should be left on until part of the bone is burned, and then scrape off what is burned from the bone, and it will be healed.	Some said the skin was to be cauterized through to the bone and the cautery held until some of the thickness of the bone was burnt. Then the burnt bone was to be scraped out, then dressed.	0.7901849
And others say that the cautery should be left on and pressed so hard that it removes a piece of bone as large as a spindle that women use, so that the humors are completely expelled; and the wound should be left open for a long time; afterward, it should be cleaned and closed.	Others said that the cautery should be carried through to burn a deep impression in the bone so that there should come out of the bone a piece shaped like a grain of a carob tree or a small spindle-whorl; they asserted that the vapours of the head would be exhaled through this place. The wound should be kept open a long while, then dressed until healed.	0.73216075
And these two methods of cautery do not seem good to me overall, except in some men where there is a way of fear; and it seems to me that I should leave it; for the head is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other members; and especially when the patient’s head is weak by nature, and the first method of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use this method to work together for healing.	But these two methods of cauterization I do not consider right except on certain men; and I regard them as risky. In my opinion, to let the patient alone is preferable and safer, if it is to be. For the head is weakened when its natural continuity is broken, as we see in other parts, and particularly when the patient's head is weak by nature. In my opinion the first type of cauterization is safer and better; therefore use that and be safe.	0.8460355
