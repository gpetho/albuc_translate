The author of this book, having completed this book for you my sons, which is a part of the science in medicine with its fullness and reaching the clarity and explanation of its aim, has seen fit to complete it for you with this article, which is a part of practical work.
For manual labor is improved in our country and at our time it's utterly extinct, to the extent that its science was studied and its effects were discontinued. Only a few remnants remain of it in ancient books that have been distorted by handwriting, and its reality is errors and confusion until its meanings were obscured and its benefits diminished.
So I decided to revive it and write this article on the path of explanation, clarification, and concision. I will provide diagrams of tools and other instruments of work since they are an addition to knowledge and something necessary.
The reason there is no craftsman skilled in handwork today is because medical surgery takes a long time, and one who does it should have prior knowledge of Galen's description of anatomy. So as to understand the benefits of organs, their structure, and its fluctuations, their connections and separations. One should also know about bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers, and where they exit. They must understand capillaries, veins, arteries, and their locations along with the exits of these components.
That's why the pioneers say that doctors by name are many, but by actual practice few indeed, particularly in handcraft surgery. We ourselves have mentioned this at one end of this book's introduction.
For he who was not aware of what we mentioned about anatomy would certainly commit a mistake that kills people, as I have seen many who visualize this science and claim it with no knowledge or understanding.
That which I saw, a doctor ignorant, he cut into a pig's fat tumor in the neck of a woman. He severed some of her neck arteries so she bled to death right before him.
I saw another doctor who advanced in removing a stone from a man who was punctured in the kidney; it was a large stone that heaved, and he removed it with a piece of the bladder. The man died about three days, and I had been summoned to remove it; I saw the size of the stone and the condition of the urine, estimating what I witnessed.
I saw another doctor who was supporting himself among some of our local military leaders with medicine.
I saw a black slave who had a fracture near the ankle with an injury to him, and the doctor, in his haste, tightened the fracture on the wound using ligatures and clamps tightly without allowing the wound to breathe.
Then he indulged him in his desires, then left him for days and ordered him not to use the ligature until his leg and foot swelled up and he was at risk of death.
I summoned him, and I quickly removed the ligature, allowing him relief from his pains. He was able to recover from them, however, the gangrene had become established in the member, and I could not remove it.
The gangrene continued to spread within the member until she died.
I saw another doctor who treated a cancerous tumor that bubbled after days until it became large in his patient. It is because when cancer is pure of black mixture, it should not be exposed to iron fundamentally.
Except for a body part that can be entirely removed.
And this, my children, should teach you that work with the hand divides into two sections: a work accompanied by safety and a work that often involves complications in most cases.
And warnings have been given at every point where this book deals with work that involves risk and fear, so you should be cautious about it and avoid it.
So that the ignorant do not find the way to speak and to refute, take for yourselves firmness and caution, and for your health show kindness and persistence.
And use the best path leading to safety and commendable outcome, and be prepared for the dangerous yet frequent diseases.
And purify yourselves from anything you fear may cast doubt upon your religion and worldly affairs, for it is better for you and raises your chances in this world and the hereafter due to your efforts.
Galenus, in some of his instructions, said: Do not treat illness; rather, call yourselves practitioners of ill-fate.
This article has been divided into three doors.
The first door.
In the first section, you will find detailed instructions from the ancient era to the current times about fire-knife operations, well-organized, along with images of tools and equipment used for hand surgery, as well as anything else required for this field.
The second door.
In the second section, you will find detailed instructions and diagrams on cutting, stitching, splinting, bleeding, surgeries, removing arrows, and similar procedures all organized step by step along with images of tools.
The Third Gate.
In algebra and traction, and the treatment of dislocations and such, there is an ordered apparatus from century to antiquity with illustrations of machines.
The first gate.
In the kidney.
And before we mention its use, it should be mentioned how to benefit from and its drawbacks, and in what mood it is used.
I say, the discussion about how to benefit from the kidney and its drawbacks is a long topic with precise knowledge and hidden secrets, in which many wise people have spoken.
And they differed on it. I have shortened their brief discourse for fear of going into unnecessary length.
I say, the kidney benefits generally for every bad mood that occurs with or without a substance as a catalyst. There are two types of such moods: one is the hot mood without substance and the other is the dry mood without substance.
Now, if it's the dry mood with a substance, they have differed on it. Some say that the kidney benefits in such cases, while others disagree stating that the kidney is not suitable for a disease resulting from heat and dryness because of the nature of fire being characterized by heat and dryness.
And it's impossible to derive treatment for a disease that is both hot and dry with a medicine that is also hot and dry. The one who argues against this states that the kidney can be beneficial when exposed to fire, treating diseases that are both hot and dry which occur in human bodies. Because if you add the body and its moisture to the fire mood, it will result in the body becoming cold.
And I say as he says, because experience has shown me that. But it shouldn't be imagined in this matter unless one has consented and navigated through the door of the kidney extensively. Stop to consider the differences in people's dispositions and conditions of their diseases within themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for other moods, there is no fear of them for you and certainly not for the cold wet diseases, all physicians agree on them and they do not differ in the benefit of garlic for them.
Know, my sons, that there is the benefit of treatment with fire and its superiority to treatment with burned medicine because fire is a single essence that does not exceed the function of an organ in which it affects or harms another connected organ only slightly.
And treatment with burned medicine might go beyond its function to later organs and may cause a disease within the organ that is difficult to cure, or it may kill. But because of the dignity and generosity of fire's essence, this only happens if it has been overdone.
And we have understood that through experience due to the long service, care for craftsmanship, and standing on the facts of the matter.
For this reason, I refrained from lengthening the discussion even though it would be fitting for my book if I had included a secret and mysterious aspect of fire and how it operates in bodies and its absence from diseases with philosophical proof that validates understanding.
Know, my sons, that they have disagreed on the time when garlic should be used and declared that the best time is during spring.
And I say that garlic can be used at all times because the harm caused by time gets absorbed in the benefit brought about by garlic. And especially if garlic is from necessary strong pains that cannot tolerate delay, for fear that it might follow with a worse problem than the internal harm caused by time.
Do not let the people and the uneducated doctors confuse you, my sons, that the worm which cures a disease will never recur and make it into an infamous entity.
Neither is the worm, which they imagined to have the capability of changing moods and drying out moisture, which is a cause of pains.
Yet the worm prefers over medicine in terms of the speed of its success, strength of its action, and intensity of its sovereignty.
However, the illness might return at some time according to the patient's mood and the success of their disease and its strength, as well as what accumulates in his body due to negligence in acquiring food and so on, among other causes.
O God, let the disease that uses worms be a gentle one and in an organ with little moisture and dampness. Like the worm that relieves pain and such, it may be possible that this pain does not recur, which would be at least a relief.
As for the general public's statement that the worm is the last resort of medicine, it is a correct saying not in line with what they believe because they think there is no cure that can benefit either with or without medication after getting the worm, which goes against this.
The meaning of "the worm is the last resort" simply means that if we have tried various treatments for a disease without success, then we use the worm as a final treatment which does work. Therefore, here lies the reason why 'the worm' is considered the last resort in medicine. Not according to the interpretation that many people and some uneducated doctors have arrived at.
I have mentioned that gold is better than iron, and they said this because of the balance of gold and the nobility of its essence. They also claimed that it does not corrode the place where it's applied, which is absolutely false.
Because I tried it and found that it works in some bodies but not in others. The one made of gold is better than iron as they said, except that if you heated the anvil in fire with gold, you wouldn't be able to tell when it reaches the temperature needed for redness of the gold.
And because it accelerates cooling; if you increase its heat in fever, it melts in fire and it can cause confusion for the craftsman. Therefore, iron is faster and closer to perfection in our work, if Allah wills.
This chapter on the treatment of injuries has been organized into sections from head to foot, making it easier for the student as Allah willing, to achieve what they need.
The first section.
In the head, there is one type of treatment.
This type of treatment is useful for combating moisture and cold that affect the brain, both causes of headaches, frequent headcold symptoms going from the head to the eyes and ears area, excessive sleepiness, toothaches, and sore throats. In short, for every illness exposed to cold such as fevers, seizures, fainting and so on.
The process of this treatment involves initially instructing the patient to undergo three or four nights of bowel cleansing with a gentle head-clearing medicine, depending on their strength, age and habits.
Then you should have him shave his head with the Moses method, and place him in front of you sitting up with his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the tip of his nose between his eyes. Where your middle finger ends, mark that position with ink.
Then heat the oil-based wax as shown here.
Lift your hand if the size of the shoulder joint opening is as big as a man's head or as big as a pomegranate seed. If it is cold, repeat with the same hammer or with another one if it has cooled down. Until you see what was explained to you from the bone, then take some salt and dissolve it in water. Put a cotton ball into it and drink its contents. Place the cotton on the site and leave it for three days.
Then, apply a cotton ball soaked in oil to him until the burnt smell disappears. Then heal him with the four ointments until he recovers, if God wills.
And they said that the wound becomes better and more effective the longer it stays open, allowing pus to come out.
Some of them advised to burn the skin towards the bone until the wax sticks to it, burning some thickness of the bone. Then remove what burned from the bone afterwards and treat.
Others argued that one should use more wax until it has a strong effect on the bone, making it fall off like a carnat or a small flake. They claimed that steam from this area rises and keeps the wound open for a long time.
Then treat until it disappears. I have only seen these kinds of wax in some people, and leaving it with me is better for safety if possible. If health allows, the head doubles its size when the natural connection breaks as we have observed in other body parts.
And especially when the male's foreskin is naturally weak, and the first type of circumcision, which I prefer and advocate, should be done. If God willing, proceed with it.
The Second Chapter.
In the second section as well.
If pain of a chronic nature occurs in the head of the foreskin and this lasts for some time with circumcision, use clamps, forceps, scissors, knives and bandages. And especially if you have performed one kind of circumcision as we described, and nothing else has helped him, then observe. If the head of the foreskin is strong and not weak, and he finds severe coldness, perform another circumcision slightly above this one. Then, perform circumcision on each centimeter of his head until the thickness of the skin disappears and exposes the amount of bone described. And perform circumcision at the tip of his head in the area known as the "awl", gently apply your hand here and do not expose the bone. The foreskin finds this pain intense, different from the pain of all other head circumcisions, I will mention this circumcision in its place.
It should be that the clamp with which he tapers his head and its tip is softer than the clamp used on the middle of the head, this is how it looks.
The Third Chapter.
In the case of the non-chronic sisterhood.
If pain occurs in the slit of the head accompanied by a headache and the pain extends to the eye, cleanse the foreskin with purifying medicines and use all other treatments that I mentioned for disease sections. If this does not help, there are two ways for this situation. Either through the use of hot medicines and treatments or through iron.
And if the remedy is through burned medicines, it involves taking a single garlic clove, peeling it, and cutting its ends from both sides. Then split the sore's bite area with a wide saw until there forms a site under the skin that can accommodate the garlic clove.
And it should be inserted under the skin until it disappears, then pull on it with a strong pull for about fifteen hours, and leave it. Then remove the garlic and hold on to the wound for one or two days, or three days, and then carry on.
Cover the area with a cotton pad soaked in oil until pus comes out, then treat it with ointment until you are healed if God wills. If you wish, do this using some of the burned medicines that I mentioned in article eighteen of burned medicines.
And if the treatment is through iron, it follows this specification: heat the iron as shown in this image:.
The iron is called the piercer because its head resembles a pin, with some curvature at the tip and a small hole in the middle.
Then place it on the sore spot, hold your hand, and turn the prong a little bit at a time. The amount of burning that you apply to the skin should be about half its thickness. Lift your hand to avoid burning the blood vessel below, which could cause bleeding. Then soak a cotton ball in salt water and place it on the spot, leaving it for three days. Then hold the cotton with oil, and treat it with ointment until you recover if God wills.
And if you wish, use this companion with the cutting blade of the hammer and guard against cutting the artery in this non-chronic condition specially.
The fourth chapter.
In this is the chronic condition.
If treated with the advanced treatment that we have mentioned and the sections on diseases, if the treatment does not work and you see a cause that is not addressed by what we have mentioned from the first 'ka' using medicine or the second 'ka' using fire. You should protect the hammer's cutting blade so that it becomes white after you have practiced on the area of pain along its length for half an inch or about that, and leave your hand there once and pull it until you cut the artery and reach close to the bone.
However, you should guard against touching the movable jawbone that vibrates when chewing, as it may burn the muscle or nerve that moves it causing spasms.
And be careful and watchful for the bleeding from the artery that you cut; there is danger in its severance. And especially so for those who are unaware of what they do and have no well-defined path, leaving the work to be done first.
And the measure for stopping excessive bleeding from the artery will be mentioned according to its place in the book if Allah wills, and if you see a cause that this method does not address.
And if I saw the body of the dead person capable of being cut in the middle of the head as we described, and treated the wound until it heals if God wills.
And if you wish, use the tool we mentioned in the chapter on freeing the vessel with the two-bladed knife, for it is a better and more effective method.
The Fifth Chapter.
In it, pains of the ears.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with lubricants and all other treatments mentioned in this section, but the pain does not go away, increase the size of the tool which we call 'the point', as shown here.
Then, after protecting it around the entire ear or both of them if the pain is in both, puncture with it. And move the tool a little from the root of the ear after learning its place with the stick, and make the tool have about ten points in each ear or around it. Then treat all places until God willing they are cured.
The Sixth Chapter.
In it, the strength.
The strength that is treated with force only occurs when phlegm is produced, as explained in the sections on diseases.
And it avoids the type of force that occurs from dryness and tension of the nerves.
When this type of strength is treated with leeches, leaches, and suction cups without relief, it seems that the patient should be treated with three tools. One at the root of the ear, the second slightly below the lobe, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make your tool against the diseased side, for relaxation only occurs in the correct place.
The description of the kyia is as follows: to augment its quality by placing a piece of bone slightly above the top ear in the skull and another one at the throat, with its length equaling the length of the hyoid.
Lower your hand until it burns half of the thickness of the skin; this is an illustration of a knife, which is a type of surgical tool that has advanced in its appearance, yet it is slightly softer than it as you can see. The blade of the knife should have a slightly rough texture, then treat the site with what has been mentioned until it heals if God willing.
Chapter Seven.
In the case of chronic embolism.
If the embolism is confirmed and treated as we have instructed, but if the treatment does not work and it is not due to a fever lasting four days. On each of his skull bones, a piece of bone and then another piece in the middle of the head as we have mentioned, and a piece on the end of the head according to what has been said.
The description of the mucus knife as explained before, it may also be augmented with a piece of bone on the mouth of the stomach for better effect, then treat it as instructed.
Chapter Eight.
In the case of forgetfulness.
The one who has phlegm should first drink from the larger vials and purified seeds for the brain.
Then shave his whole head and place on the tip of it a castor oil bandage as written in the article on attachment, carrying it around several times; for it is a type of treatment.
Perform it on the same level as the one mentioned there, if he recovers by doing so, otherwise cut him three times at the back of his head with them being placed from the top of the head to below the neck.
Place a finger's width between each cut, then treat the cut with what was mentioned. If you want to increase it and it is reasonable for that, cut out the middle cut.
If you want to increase the size, cut through both bones and treat it until he recovers. The stitches should be oily as described previously.
The Ninth Chapter.
In the falaj cut and relax the entire body.
It is necessary to progress in cleansing the head with the incisions and what we mentioned, then shave the head of the patient. Next, cut one incision on the center of the head, and two more cuts on each side of the head, ending up by cutting at the back.
And three on the neck creases, if you need more for body relaxation in a reason and the patient is compatible with that while the disease is strong and stable, cut four incisions on his back creases. Cut until the skin is burned as much as possible and raise your hand, then treat it as previously described until he recovers if Allah wills. The stitches should be oily.
The Tenth Chapter.
In the cut for epilepsy.
Only the stricken by phlegm epilepsy needs his brain to be cleaned first with large incisions and all other treatments we mentioned in the sections if the patient is big enough and can take medicine.
If however the child cannot tolerate the medicines, he should use the brain washers and the pure millet for many days before that with improving his diet.
Then he shaves his head, then makes one incision in the middle of the head as described earlier, and another cut at the back. On each hundredth of his head, he makes an incision. If the patient is strong and can endure it, he should make the cuts mentioned in the falaj book, rest the body on the cervical vertebrae and spinal points, and let the needle be oily as described earlier.
If the patient is a child, make the needle gentle according to this image.
The eleventh chapter.
In the case of malaria.
If the cause of malaria is dampness and thick phlegm, make the incisions as we mentioned in the falaj book.
If the cause of malaria is a tendency towards blackness and the patient's body is excessively wet, cleanse his brain as described in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cotton cake like a circle and put it in the center of his head. The patient should be seated comfortably touching each side, take one pound of old goat tallow.
Then heat it on the fire to a moderate warmth that can be handled if an finger is inserted, then pour it in the middle of his head into the circle and let it cool until it cools down. Do this once every week along with all other good procedures for the patient until he recovers if God wills.
And if you wish to refine it, puncture numerous small spots on the surface without touching the tool with your hand. Instead, let there be smell; this type of ka'i softens the brain in moderation.
Then apply cotton that has been soaked in oil or chicken fat on it.
The second chapter.
In the ka'i water that falls in the eye.
If you notice the start of the water that falls in the eye through the signs mentioned in this division, act quickly for him who suffers from it. Wash his head and protect him from all moisture; bathe him gently in the hot bath for several days.
Then, shave his head and apply ka'i in the middle of the head. Then apply two ka'is on the cheeks. If the water starts falling in both eyes, or from one side, do it for one eye.
Then, cut all the veins and arteries under the skin with the tool. The ka'is should be of the same length as the cheeks. Be cautious to avoid bleeding.
If you see anything excess, cut it on the spot with whatever treatment you can and we will come to wisdom in releasing the arteries, cutting them, and guarding against bleeding.
And it may be softened by two strong ka'is under the bones in the forehead.
The thirteenth chapter.
In ka'i for chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and perpetual, having been before from the veins and arteries on the head's surface from outside the head, you ascertain that this is due to thick cold gumlike mucus. Apply the ka'i which I described for the water that falls in its starting. In the middle of the head, two incisions on the jaws and two incisions in the temples below the bones. If more is needed, add one incision at each side of the eye socket by the eyebrow with a small mark.
The Fourteenth Chapter
In how to perform nose surgery.
If treatment with what we have mentioned in the section did not heal it, proceed with the quill of the blind eagle for three nights. Then shave his head and apply the central incision using an oily quill. Then, using the puncturing quill, make two incisions above the eyebrows close to the hairline but avoid cutting the artery; this is how a puncturing quill looks.
The Fifteenth Chapter
In how to relax the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to disease or moisture, apply one incision on the eyelid using this conical quill.
And if you wish, apply two incisions slightly above the eyebrows on each side, spaced away from the jaws. Each incision should be as long as the eyebrow.
Don't overdo with the incision, just enough to char about a third of the skin. The appearance of the needle should be like this.
The Sixteenth Chapter
In how to deal with the eyelid.
If her eyelashes turn inward and irritate the eye, there are two types of incision for this. Either by incision with fire or by incision using burned medicine. If it's by fire, you should order the affected person to leave their eyelashes if they have them so that they grow longer and even out.
If it germinates when sown, bind its roots with a band so that it does not move until it germinates. When it has germinated and grown, place the patient's head on your stone, then draw a mark on the eyelid like the shape of a piece of paper using a brush.
The marking begins near the inner corner of the eye. Then, place a cotton swab saturated with the whites of eggs or saliva below the eyelid. After that, heat up an iron to resemble its shape.
Then, carefully burn the shape you learned in many repetitions until the skin surface burns completely like a piece of paper as is, and it is an indication that your work is healthy when you see the eyelid swelling and the hair has risen above the eye lid.
Then raise your hand and leave him for three days. After that, carry a cotton ball with butter to remove the scabs. Then treat him with ointment until he is cured if Allah wills. If some hair returns after a while and relaxes the eyelid, it indicates recovery.
Repeat the operation at this spot as you did initially. If hair is on the lower eyelid, pluck it until it returns to its natural position and does not thin out the eye. With medicated ointment, instruct the patient to leave the inner corner alone until it grows longer and even.
Then create a shape like paper aswad from the usual soap and from the unquenched lead from each one, weighing it about a dirham or so. Crush them all well into a good paste and do this by grinding to prevent it from drying out. Then spread it on the paper you made in the shape of a piece of paper Aswad, and place it on one or two eyelids. Then, place a cotton ball soaked with egg white under the eye, and put the patient's head on your stone.
Place your little finger on the medicine and hold it a bit while you move it. Whenever you feel the presence of the poison through the nostril, since he finds in it pleasure like fire; as long as he finds this pleasure leave the medicine and move it with your finger until the pleasure stops, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And look, if you see that the eyelid has risen as it rises when burning with fire or cutting, otherwise renew him from the medicine on the place where the medicine did not make a difference and did not darken until your task is completed and the eye burns then put cotton with wax on him until the burn scab comes off.
Then treat him with the camel ghee or any other until he is cured, and it is necessary for you when working to be extremely cautious not to let a drop of medicine fall into the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after days and there's fear that some hair may enter the eye.
Renew the medicine on that place where the eyelid has relaxed specially as you did initially, then treat him until he is cured. This is a hand-written manuscript page of a 10th century Arabic surgery textbook by Albucasis.
Know that the eyes of people may differ in smallness and largeness, so according to this, your treatment should be, not leaving the right path for those who have a way in such an industry.
Chapter Seventeen.
In the case of the nacre that is exposed in the cornea of the eye.
If you treated the nacre as we mentioned in sections of diseases and if your treatment did not work, it is necessary that you focus on this feature.
Command the patient to place his head in your lap and hold his head captive between your hands so it doesn't move or bang with its head.
Then place a wet cotton in the white of the egg or on his saliva on his eyes, then heat the iron which is its image.
Be hollow like the feather of an eagle at one end which has the kyi (a tool for extraction) and if you wish let the other end be pointed, or make it a pipe as this hollow is better for your work, God willing.
Then squeeze the nostril if it is open and extract the mucus or if it is not open you make it open and take out its contents then place the iron on it which is very safe and hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And move your hand slightly away from the kyi (extraction tool) from the eye to the nose so you do not mistake with your hand or disturb the patient, causing damage to the eyelid. If it reaches the first kyi at the bone then redo the iron once more if necessary.
Leave him for three days then apply a cotton with lard on him and heal him with the dried ointment until he recovers. If it has been 40 days and he did not recover, apply the strongest medicine until the bone comes out. I will mention what follows in its chapter if God willing.
Another tip on the kyi (extraction tool) was mentioned by some earlier authors. You should cut to the nostril location then put a thin plug in this cut, which is its image.
And pour in it a weight equivalent to one dirham of melted lead, hold your hand tightly on the plug in good grip and make sure not to move the patient at all for fear that the melted lead might drip into his eye. It is recommended to place on the patient's eye wet cotton soaked in egg white or water.
If lead burns the place of the naught and frees it from a strange cure, if the naught is freed with what we mentioned regarding care and treatment; otherwise, resorting to a nasal hole puncture and returning the naught to its original nasal passage must be done as will be explained in its specific place.
The eighteenth chapter.
In a cut of the cheek.
Often, a cut in the cheek is called a hairline, especially in infants' lips. Many times, this cut happens, if treated with what we have mentioned in the section, if the treatment fails. So heat up a small, sharp knife on this image.
Its inside should be placed on the edge of the knife, then the operator places it in the same cut until the heat reaches the depth of the cut. Then treat with a candle until God willing, it heals.
The nineteenth chapter.
In the case of piercing lead occurring in the mouth.
If it appears at the root of the tooth or in the gum, or at the roots of the gums with pus and swelling then it explodes and becomes a flowing sore. Then it was treated but if the treatment did not succeed in healing it, it should be heated as much as possible fits in the lead.
Then the operator inserts it into the hole of the lead and holds your hand until the iron reaches both ends of its hole. Do this one or two times, then treat it afterwards with the treatment we mentioned till God willing it heals.
If the material has broken and healed, then it is alright; otherwise, it would be necessary to expose the area and remove the decayed bone as will be explained in its section if God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
In it is the secretion of pus and relaxation of gum tissues.
If the gum tissue relaxes due to moisture and pus secretes, and if it doesn't recover after treatment with medicines, place the patient's head on your knee. Then heat the iron that will appear next, after placing the tube on the lump.
The iron, protected by the wheel, enters her. Hold your hand slightly so that the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the lump. Then raise your hand and repeat the process as many times as you need until the patient fills their mouth with salt water.
He holds it for an hour and throws him away. The moving lump gets fixed, the relaxed gum tissue tightens, and the bad moisture dries up.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In cases of gum pain.
If gum pain is due to cold or there are worms inside and treatment with medicines did not work, the approach includes two methods: either treating with fat or treating with fire.
As for treating with fat, you would take the cow's fat and boil it in a iron pot or a sieve. Then take cotton thread and tie it at one end of the heated rod. Then dip it in the boiling fat and place it on the painful tooth using the wheel to hold it until it cools down.
Then repeat it several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. Or if you prefer, you can dip wool or cotton in cold fat and place it on the painful tooth, then put the heated wheel above it so that the fire reaches the base of the tooth.
And if it is treated with fire, this means using a copper or iron tube. There should be some wax in its core to prevent the heat of the fire from reaching the opening of the scar. Then light the lamp that comes out of its shape and place it on the same incision while holding your hand until the lamp cools down. Do this several times.
And the pain either goes away that day, or another day. After this, it is necessary for him to fill the scar with good tallow and hold it for an hour, then throw it away; this is the shape of the lamp.
You can apply it to any part you want and according to what is possible, this is the shape of the tube.
The Second Twenty-First Chapter.
In the cooking of pigs.
If the pigs are for phlegm and cold moisture and do not yield to ripening with medicines, and you want a quick ripening, then heat up the hollow lamp that has its ends inserted.
So that smoke comes out from the other end during cooking, place it protected on the same tumor once and twice if needed until it reaches the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the lamp according to the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days, and carry on it cotton soaked in tallow until what is burned by the fire goes away. Then treat him with ointment and needles until he recovers if God wills.
The Twenty-Third Chapter.
In the cooking of the throat obstruction and difficulty in breathing.
If moisture dominates in the bronchial tube, especially if this is accompanied by cold mood, it would be advisable to first drain the pus using purgative medicines, then tone up its condition through tapping at the neck of the gallbladder at the lowered position.
Be cautious not to reach the gallbladder, only burn half of the skin, then apply another toning treatment at the joint of the neck in the end of its stronger part. Let the applicator be pointed on the skin condition that was advanced.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned until he is healed, if God willing.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In cases of lung disease and coughing.
If coughing and lung disease are due to cold moisture, not pus, without fever or phlegm, apply two tonics above the hilum in soft, empty low positions, then another tonic in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The applicator should be pointed like the advanced image, and if you wish, it can be a dotted pessary with a pessary called 'the point', which has been illustrated in pitting headaches. The points would be thirty to about that number.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned until he recovers. You can make a pessary with three branches like this image, and hasten its use because you apply it once in one go for three pessaries, and here is the image of the pessary.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In the treatment of hernia.
If the humeral head dislocates due to slippery moisture or fails to stay in place when pushed back until it becomes habitual, and then dislocates at the slightest movement as we have seen, it should be that the jaw moves first. Then the invalid lies on his back or on the correct side. Then raise the skin inside the armpit to above with your left hand fingers if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then heat the two-tined iron, which is shown here.
Then it is heated until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cut becomes four cuts. It can be heated with an iron that has two tines; in this case, the shape of the cut will then become five cuts, with the tines on a smooth surface.
And here is an image of the iron with three ridges.
And this number may be increased by one, making the cuts eight in total. Then, the hot salted balls are placed on top of the cut and bandaged onto the invalid. The limb is not moved for a while until it heals; however, dislocation upwards is less likely to occur.
Apply a single, well-formed cut on the knee or many cutting cuts that are finely scored. This will strengthen the joint and eliminate moisture, cleaning the invalid.
The twenty-sixth chapter.
In the case of stomach cuts.
If there occurs a cold and wet discharge in the stomach to such an extent that it disrupts its balance, causing frequent discharges, and treated with various treatments but without any improvement, it should be that the invalid lies on his back, stretches his legs and arms, and then three cuts are applied. The incision should be made with a dagger the size of an index finger in the middle of the breast, and two more incisions below each single incision until the shape of the incisions becomes triangular. There should be distance between them so they don't come together when the wound heals. The depth of the incisions should be one third of the thickness of the skin, and the shape of the incisions should remain consistent.
On this image and to this extent only.
And if you prefer, make one large incision in the middle of the stomach on this image.
And the dagger with which you make the single incision should be in the shape of a circle, as shown on this image.
And the stomach can be punctured with a point, for those who are troubled by this cut and want to practice on the stomach at the point corresponding to what you desire with the needle, then puncture it with a point-shaped dagger. Then treat it with the remedy that you prescribe until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seventh.
In the incision of the cold liver.
If the liver presents with pain due to coldness, moisture or a strong breeze until it deviates from its natural mood and is treated with what we have mentioned in the section, but that did not cure. The ill person should lie on their back and make three incisions with the needle in this way and to this extent, exactly like this image, under the ribs where the body of the human ends, on the liver.
After each incision, another one is made at the thickness of a finger. The incision should be straight along the body's length and you shouldn't touch your hand with the dagger at all.
Let the amount of burning in thick skin be half, there is no more. Let the burned person stand on his feet; if he cannot stand, let him lie down with outstretched legs and raised arms. This is a representation of the forge.
And you can cauterize these ulcers with the surgical knife if you have a skilled and careful craftsman with you, and take care not to burn too much. If you do that, you will burn all the skin and reach the stomach. The skin there is thin; know it.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In cases of a tumor in the liver, use cautery.
If there is a discharge in the liver and you want to know whether this tumor is within the liver tissue or the diaphragm, then if it's within the liver tissue, the patient will feel weight and pain without any intensity.
And if it's within the diaphragm of the liver, there will be intense pain and you might see that doctors have given up treating him. It should then be advised for the patient to lie down on his side. Then apply heat with a hot needle on this warm place.
Then heat the forge in fire, which is similar to a mill, and this is its image. Use it to cauterize one ulcer until the whole skin burns, and finish the cauterization up to the diaphragm until all pus is removed. Then treat it with pus remedies until it heals.
This type of cautery should only be used by someone who has a long experience in medicine, and these diseases have been treated through trials on their hands many times. Then, they can undertake such work; leaving it to me would be better.
Chapter Nineteen
In the practice of suturing.
First, take one of the long dry threads from among the roots and it should be as long as possible. It should be thick like a finger. Then, soak it in oil and bring it to heat over fire. Then, place one stitch between the connection of the collarbone and neck and two small stitches without causing much discomfort slightly tilted towards the chin area. Place two large stitches above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
Also, place two stitches between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly towards the back. Place another stitch in the middle of the chest and one above the stomach. Three stitches from behind are placed between the shoulders and two on each side below the stitch that is located between the elbows.
It should not be necessary to insert your fingers into the stitch, but there should be a visible impression on the skin. Some of my predecessors have mentioned that some people use an iron needle which is almost half an inch long, they protect it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the same tumor.
The duration of the treatment is as we have mentioned for a liver tumor. With this kind of treatment with stitches through the organs, either the patient dies from its effects or it may leave him with a disability that cannot be cured.
Chapter Thirty
In treating the gallbladder.
If you have treated gallbladder disease with the treatment we have mentioned in the previous section and it did not work, the stitches should be performed in three ways; all are correct. One of them is to stitch it with three or four stitches lined up along the length of the gallbladder.
The shape of the gallbladder which presents its form and is located between each gallstone, having hardness like the thickness of a finger or more slightly. It has the property that was mentioned in the description of the gallbladder stone either being deep when you insert your hand inside it, and the image of the patient is lying on his back.
And the other side in the accompanying figure, you lift the skin that is next to the liver where the accompanying fold of the patient ends and you lift the skin that is next to the liver where the left accompanying fold ends. You raise your skin across the body so that the gallstones lie along the body.
Then the two scalpels are carefully inserted until they penetrate to the other side of the skin, then remove the gallstone; making four stones. If desired, you can use another similar three-bladed instrument for excision.
Then, after leaving the operation site to allow pus drainage for a long time, it is better than all other treatments that have been mentioned, as it promotes healing.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the operation of astisqa (a surgical procedure).
The gallstone only benefits in the surgery of zakkia (a specific surgical procedure), especially when treated with various treatments we mentioned in the section. If your treatment was not effective, it is necessary to use four stones around the stomach and one stone on the stomach.
Another gallstone on the liver and one stone on the spleen, two stones behind his back between the ribs near his chest and another one near his stomach. The depth of the gallstone should be close to the thickness of the skin. Then leave the gallstone open allowing pus drainage for a long time.
Omitting the treatment of the patient after surgery is not appropriate, according to what should be conducive for those concerned to hasten their recovery. The image of the brace that supports the back takes a metallic appearance as described earlier and in which the back is supported becomes oily-like.
The second and thirtieth chapter.
In both feet and legs.
If they swell in the instep and fill with yellow water, it should be treated by pressing on the back of the foot at the spot between the ankle bone and the base of the little toe.
Place your hand on the brace, do not rub it, then lift your hand and don't put it back immediately, for this allows the yellow water to drain and the brace will be in this shape.
Then apply to the thighs in pairs, two each leg, with each knee positioned at the end of the sharp part of the brace, and one knee is along the thigh below the knee and another towards the middle of the leg. Each leg receives two braces in this manner.
Leave the brace open without treating it for a long time, allowing water to drain from it, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
The thirty-third chapter.
In treating diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and moisture, it can weaken the strong holding and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines. This condition requires various treatments that may not completely cure it until you find the patient suitable for treatment and with sufficient strength. In such a case, treat him by placing a large brace on his stomach. Following what was described in applying to the stomach with a circular brace, four braces around the waist should be smooth and made of the gentle metallic brace. Place a large brace on cotton above the tongue or two braces.
If I see abundant moisture and the cause is susceptible to that, then I would cut in a manner on the elbow and on each scapula, and perhaps add two small cuts near the larger one. This is a successful treatment whose benefit does not fail, God willing.
The fortieth chapter.
In the treatment of bedsores.
If there are chronic bedsores in the patient, whether numerous or a single one, and it is mixed with thick, cold or rotten moisture that has been treated as we have described earlier, but if the treatment does not work, then cut three cuts on the lower part of the back beneath the table slightly triangularly.
A cut under the navel with two fingers, and if you estimate that her stomach has cooled down and her food doesn't digest properly, and if I see her face swollen, then cut on the stomach in a large manner as described previously, and a cut on his liver. Another on the gallbladder with a pricking cut, leave the incision open for some time, then treat him until he recovers, God willing.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of ulcers.
After cutting it, if you have cut the abscess, widen the incision that resembles a plow. Then insert a drain tube into the same cut abscess and extend your hand until the tube reaches the wound from which blood is seeping. Do this once or twice.
If there are many ulcers, then cut each one in the manner we described. Then treat it with a remedy suitable for it until it heals. If the severity of the ulcer is very large, then a larger incision would be more beneficial for its treatment.
Chapter Thirty-Four
In the place of the sun that is in the seat and its surroundings.
If the pus does not drain to the cut and sticks to that which we described in its place, refusing this action; maybe it heals by the sun. If there is a nodule due to heat inside, pus comes out from one of the areas along with foul-smelling liquid, then you should first use a thin probe to examine it.
Then determine the depth of the hole with the probe, heat up a tool resembling a pestle, then gently insert it into the nodule along the width and length of the nodule and the amount that the probe entered. Keep applying sunlight until all the diseased tissues are burned out completely or two or three times depending on your need.
Be cautious not to burn nerves if they exist or to have excessive sweating, and ensure that the nodule doesn't lead towards the bladder organ or towards the intestine.
Be cautious about all these areas, do this if the nodule is in a place of fever and you've determined that it's not penetrating deeply. Then treat the area until it heals completely. If the site then closes up and stops feeding with its contents and remains like this for some time, understand that it has healed perfectly.
And if it doesn't stop feeding its contents, know that it's penetrating deeply or in a hole of rotten bone or similar things which will be described in the place where it is.
Chapter Thirty-Five
In the case of the kidney.
If there is pain in the kidney due to cold or strong winds, and a decrease in the production of urine, it should be treated by heating the kidney as one would with each kidney on an incendiary tool. This method might require up to three applications at the same table; resulting in three neatly arranged heat treatments which provide better benefits.
Chapter Thirty-Seven
In the bladder area.
If there is weakness and relaxation in the bladder leading to not holding urine until it leaks, then apply a poultice at the bottom of the genital area on the bladder where the beginning of the hair of irritation starts. Apply another poultice on the right side of the genital area and one more on its northern part.
And after the poultice on each side for as long as it takes, apply a second poultice at the lower back or two if needed. The compress should be in a stringer form as described previously.
Chapter Thirty-Four
In the womb area.
If there is a substance of cold and moisture in the womb, it might prevent the blood from circulating properly, causing deterioration or difficulty in its flow. If she feels pain upon its arrival, she should apply three poultices around the genital area as we explained with the bladder poultice. And apply a poultice on the cotton below the back or two. The compress should be in the form of needles as previously described.
Chapter Forty
In the poultice for thigh relief.
If there are mistaken wet substances that cause the thigh to move out of its place, they can be a reason for it getting displaced. The sign is if one leg becomes longer than the other when you measure them against each other, and if you find an absence in that position where the poultice should be placed. It is necessary to apply a paste on the thigh itself in a semi-circular shape as a poultice.
After you learn with the paint around its right side so that it will fall onto itself in the middle of the circle, and then apply the paste as it appears in the poultice for stomach issues. If this particular poultice does not work, apply three more poultices using the large oil-based paste.
Instruct to dig the pit for the knee according to the thickness of all the skin, then treat it until it heals if God willing.
The forty-first chapter.
In the pit of the female knee.
If pain occurs in the thigh and the cause of this is due to cold and moisture, treat it with what we mentioned in the section. If the treatment does not alleviate the pain and if this recurs, it may be necessary to simplify the wetting by adding honey from a specific tree or honey from the sabbar plant, among others.
Then soak it and orient the knee in two ways, either with burned medicines or with fire. The knee with fire has many positions; one of them is to heat three triangular knees on this image directly on the thigh itself.
Make it deep enough, and the distance between each knot should be as wide as a finger's thickness. The knots should be oily. It is possible to heat one knot right in the middle of the hip, making four knots altogether. If you wish, you can heat this area with a circular movement that you mentioned earlier when removing the hip knot.
The circle should encompass the entire hip, burning all of the skin. This is how to heat the pit in the knee if the pain is only confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, heat two knots on the thigh at the spot indicated by the pain. Heat one knot above the knee with four fingers towards the outer side slightly. The knots should be sharp. The depth of the knot should match the thickness of the skin only.
If the pain extends to the fingertips, cut where he has indicated with three or four, or more points of the dot, as required. If the pain is felt below the knee towards the leg, cut there in a single incision using a knife.
And be cautious in all your incisions not to reach the cut until you burn a major nerve or artery, as this can cause serious or temporary harm to the patient.
I have seen two cases where the incision was made above the thorax and reached down far, causing the leg to swell until it swelled up to the ankle and affected the entire body. This led to diarrhea and death afterwards. If the pain is in both sides equally, then the incisions should be made in this manner.
And some of the scholars among the wise have mentioned in the incision for the buttocks, its shape. They create a sort of hole from iron with a diameter of half a span and it's at its mouth on the hardness of the pitaya fruit or slightly less. Inside this hole, there are two other holes and another third hole.
And it should be after the distance between each two holes as much as a fist's width. The holes are open from both sides and their height is towards one or two fists, they take for them a handle made of iron that has been secured in the holes. This is its appearance.
And it is burned in the fire until it turns red and then thrown into the evil, and then it is placed on the buttock of the patient lying on the correct side. Three straight incisions are made at once, then it remains for three days with its wound ointed with fat. The wound should be left open for days.
It is done in abundance, then treat it with the ointment until it heals. The author of this book says that this type of incision was rarely used because of its complexity and grotesque appearance, and due to the scarcity of people who could endure it. But for those skilled at surgery who were able to bear it and whose position matched its execution.
And concerning the treatment by burning medicines, it is that you should make two hollow things resembling the neck where the hinges of a door are made of brass or iron.
It should have a rise of about two decades or roughly so, and there should be a thickness of an inch between them. They should also open at the bottom but not at the top; they should be joined to each other in this manner.
Then, she should be placed on the right of the hip and buttock while lying on her correct side. Your hand should be moistened with water and then poured between the two rings of heatwater that is slightly heated by fire. You should hold it for a sand hour. The buttocks will endure its taste and burning sensation, as they find an enjoyment like fire.
Until the pain subsides, lift your hand with the instrument and wipe off the hot water from the buttocks entirely with pure water. Then leave it for three days and carry weight on it until the smoking goes away. Leave it for more days until you notice pus coming out; this is what provides maximum benefit.
Then treat it with ointments until he recovers. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a container that holds water as per its size according to the buttocks, either way, this is the property of hot water which has been proven in an article on correcting medicines.
Take one part of the salt of copper and one part of the non-burned lime, grind them together, place them in a new pot that has been punctured at its bottom with a small hole as wide as it takes for the heat to enter. Place under the pot another heated pan.
Pour some pure water over the copper sand and lime until it covers them with an inch, after thoroughly mixing them with your hand. Leave the pot until the hot water falls to the bottom of the heated pan. Then collect all that water together and pour it onto another piece of lime and sand again.
When the intensity of pain is extremely strong, it behaves in many medical operations and parts of the body because it performs the same action as fire, and there are also medications that alleviate such pain like tahafisia, honey from baboon's penis gland, sulfur, and soap mixed together.
Galen claimed a story about an ancient man who treated pain in the thigh and sweating of the knees, and greatly praised his method. He claimed that he needs no other treatment and that it cures once and for all.
Even to the extent that perhaps he might be carried into the bath and come out cured, able to take green dates if they are not available. In their absence, dried dates are used instead, with a bit of fat being added and applied where there is pain on the thigh or in the leg or in the calf.
She tightens and releases it for up to three hours or as long as the patient feels relief from the burning sensation, then he should be given a bath. If his body smells good after that, he should be taken to a basin. The pain disappears and heals with God's permission. If he doesn't heal, apply another dressing ten days later.
He will heal if God wills, and know that no one should use such medicines on the knee except after exhausting the body. Dioscorides mentioned that rubbing with donkey hair can alleviate sweating of the knees.
The process for the knee is as follows: take wool, dip it in old oil and place it on the deep spot between the fingers of the hand and the thumb, which is closer to the thumb. Then use dry donkey hair.
Heat it on fire until it turns into a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes. Then take another one; continue doing this until the sensation reaches through the back to the thigh, thus ending the pain. This method of treatment is called the treatment with donkey hair.
Chapter forty-two.
In chapter on back pain.
Back pain may be caused by many reasons, either through a fall, hit, excessive exertion and so on. It can result from the accumulation of cold and damp substance. The disease under consideration falls into this category alone.
The one that results from the accumulation of a cold substance, it should be noted after the expulsion of mucus with sputum and similar substances. The pain becomes three rows on his back where the width is equal to the table itself, after studying its position by quill in each row five fish or more according to what you see possible for the mucus and its strength.
The disease is in the form of a dot and if you want, it can be three or four fish using medium-sized button-shaped points in this image.
Chapter thirty-four.
In chapter on the beginning of the bladder disease.
This cause often affects young children, and the first sign in a child is difficulty breathing upon standing or moving. You will find that there are small bumps at the end of his back that have emerged and are larger than the other bumps.
If you see this and want to stop it, puncture her with a needle that is circular in shape as depicted here. Take the fish across each part of the lump evenly. If you wish, puncture around the lump with a point-shaped needle for two or three rows, and let the points be close to each other. Then treat the site until it is cured as we have described.
And remember not to use the fish in the bladder that occurs due to muscle spasms.
Chapter Forty-Four
In chapter forty-four about gout and joint pains.
If joint pains due to cold moisture affect any part of the body, if they occur in both legs according to physicians' habits, it's called special gout.
If cold gout, treated with the remedies we mentioned earlier in this section, doesn't eliminate the pains, then gout subsides after using the following method: applying many waxes around both legs joints and making a medium-sized greasy mixture for application on such area.
If one needs to puncture on the leg, do it with a point-wax. If the pains ascend to the knees or to all joints, and this happens frequently, treat each knee three or four times from each side with that same greasy mixture wax.
If you need more than this amount of wax, apply it. Do not let your hand penetrate deep into the wax, only up to the thickness of the skin. If the pains ascend to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned about waxing in that section.
If the pains are only in the hands, puncture around the wrists as you would circle with two rows. If the pains remained in the fingers, puncture them at each node and on the hairpin of the hand. If after days, the pains ascend to the forearms or to the elbows.
Apply them from each side, and don't miss the good treatment plan along with medicine intake. If food is properly consumed and phlegm extraction happens, this waxing therapy will heal with God's will even if it does so in conjunction with these measures.
The Forty-Fourth Chapter.
In the treatment of dropsy.
If there appears a hernia in the scrotum and some of the pus has descended to the testicle, should it be an initial, soon beginning condition, you should command the patient to stop eating for that day and use enemas that might bring out his stool.
Then have him lie down on his stomach before you, command him to hold himself until the lump or pus protrudes. Then, push it back with your finger, then apply a stick under the hernia on the pelvis bone, resembling half a circle at both ends pointing upwards of the body.
Then describe this as you see it.
Until a white thing expels the evil, then pushes back the pus or lump into his body. Then a servant places his hand on the spot to prevent the pus from protruding. By this time, the patient has relieved himself between his legs and I've put a cushion under him. Another servant ties his legs together.
And another lies on his chest holding his hands, then the rod is placed on the same mark and your hand holds the rod standing straight. Hold it until it reaches the bone or tries to push it again if it didn't reach the bone on the first try.
And be careful not to let the pus emerge while you are pressing, lest you burn it. This could result in either death or great suffering for the patient. Know that if your rod doesn't reach the bone during your pressuring, your treatment fails. And make sure the boys' rods are comfortable for their sizes and those of adults as well.
Then, after three days, treat the area with fat until the redness from the heat goes away. Afterwards, apply all other ointments until he heals. Make sure the patient lies on his back for forty days so that the wound can heal properly.
It is necessary that his food for the duration of his treatment be mild to ease his stomach, so as not to cause leakage during defecation and urination. Then, if he wishes to stand up after forty days, a well-made bandage should be used which must be worn for another forty days. This reduces fatigue and over-indulgence in food, drink and severe sobbing.
If this measure is applied like this, he will be completely cured, God willing. I will mention the treatment for prostration by cutting it in its chapter if God wills. As for hernia that occurs elsewhere in the abdomen and was beginning, if you want to prevent it from increasing, make a circular stitch of the size of the hernia. Let the amount of skin that you burn be one third, then heal it with what we have mentioned. It will not increase, God willing. Some pioneers have stated that it is enough to stitch the hernia with a triangular suture in this manner.
After you have learned to apply a stitch to the hernia with a needle, make the line that is across from the top of the hernia and another one downwards. Lower your hand in the middle with one diagonal stitch. The first diagonal stitch is easier and better if God wills.
The sixty-fourth chapter.
In the second diagonal.
If there occurs in some organs about a fall or blow with pain that lasts for a long time, and the medicinal treatment does not relieve it, it is necessary to stitch with a point stitch. The stitch should be adjusted according to the size of each organ considering its weakness and strength.
And remove the pain and swelling from it; then he is cured of the first stitch. Otherwise, he should be stitched again because these kinds of pains have a habit of spreading to what is near them. You should follow up with stitches until the patient is relieved.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
In Chapter 74 regarding leprosy.
As for the lepers, they may benefit greatly from the bath, especially those with leprosy caused by phlegm and black sputum.
If you want to take a bath, look if the leprosy is beginning and treat it with what we have mentioned in this section. If it doesn't deteriorate or stop, fearing that infection may spread throughout his body, he should bathe five times on his head. The first one is in the usual middle of the head, the second beneath it towards the forehead at the end of hair and two on the temples. One behind on the occipital bone, immerse your hand slightly in the bath until it has a mild effect on the bones.
And the scaly skin peels off, facilitating the evaporation of thick fumes from it. Also, you should bathe her in the bath that we mentioned for the head as well, especially if leprosy has continued on the patient and become clearly visible, then it is necessary to use these baths that we referred to for the head. A bath on the tip of the nose, two baths on each cheekbone, two baths on the neck muscles and six on the back muscles. A large bath at the hip joints when there's weakness in that area, another one above it at the same level, and two baths on each buttock for each buttock. Two baths on each knee, one bath for each kneecap, two baths on the biceps, two baths on the ribs, and bathing on every joint of his hands and feet. A bath at the heel of each foot and twist her hands.
Preserve the nerve at the heel for fear of burning it, and there are three kinds on the bone of the footpad, another one on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver. Know that with every additional type, it becomes more beneficial and effective.
And know that the invalid does not feel hunger like the healthy due to his body being numb, and the adjustment for the larger or smaller cuts should be according to the organs and joints as described above in the properties of surgical instruments.
Then treat the cut with corn starch paste and honey, along with other treatments until it heals if Allah wills.
The forty-eighth chapter.
In the case of numbness, if a body part is numb and treated with medicines, ointments, and dressings but does not heal, then it should be treated with cuts based on the size or the strength of the bone of that body part. The incisions should also take into account the thickness of the skin being slightly more.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals. Some numbness may disappear when a hand or foot is exposed to the vertebrae in the back where the nerve emerges that moves this body part, and the numbness would go away.
And do not engage in this except for one who is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the body and the exits of the moving nerves.
The ninety-fourth chapter.
In the case of scabies.
If scabies persists and no medical remedy works, apply cuts to it of moderate depth according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then, he treats it with a fine powder of rose water for the tongue of pregnancy and blood of fowl or blood of hawks from each one part. He mixes them all together and paints it on a cloth which is then stuck onto the place until it heals.
The fiftieth chapter.
In the cancer.
If the cancer is at an early stage and you want to stop its progression, apply medicine around it like a circle as if you are spinning. Some wise people have suggested applying a thick remedy in the middle of it. However, I do not see that being necessary because I expect it might dry out and I've witnessed this happening before.
The correct approach is to apply medicine around it in the form of a circle, as we have said, or in many small applications.
The fifty-first chapter.
In the appendix.
If it happens to one of the appendixes and its maturation has been delayed, either due to the beneficial effect exerted by the factors or because the patient is old with little blood production, or due to time, and you want to accelerate the maturation of the appendix, apply small, numerous spots evenly around it.
Then leave it, as it accelerates maturation. If you want to fill the appendix with medicine, make the medicine like this image describes.
And pour it in the center of the appendix until it reaches the skin. The application should be such that is below, facilitating the drainage of pus. Then treat it with what is necessary until it heals.
The second fifty chapter.
In the appendix of the eater.
The Eater is but decay that seeks refuge in the body, devouring it as fire devours dry wood. If I see an eater existing in a location capable of being dealt with by fire, I will place numerous small and large pins against each other there according to what suits the position of the eater.
Then, confirm this from every side until the entire decay is removed and nothing remains at all. Then leave it for three days. Carry sulfur powder mixed with oil on the locations that are pressed in order to remove the scabies completely and all the decay.
Then treat it with the herbal ointments for meat. If, after three days, I see that the meat is growing healthily and there's no decay, otherwise repeat the treatment on what remains of the decayed areas. The eater can be treated with a strong medicine.
Indeed, it operates faster than fire and I mentioned its treatment with a strong medicine in the previous section. If you need it, take it from there.
The Fifty-First Chapter.
In the piercing of inverted and non-inverted needles.
This often occurs in the soles of the feet, it is a hard substance that binds to the foot. The piercing can be done in two ways: either by burning or by using hot water.
If by fire, then it consists in heating the dried cork brush resembling an eagle's feather made of iron around each side of the nail and making sure that its edges are thin. Then dip this into a protective mixture on the nail and rotate your hand with the hot iron around the nail until you reach to the depth of the nail.
He leaves it for three days to heal, then strengthens the pus with boiled bread dough that has been salted and allows the dressing to stay on overnight. It then peels off from its roots and he treats the wound site with aloe vera ointment until it heals, if the nails are not reversed.
Many times, it occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet. It is necessary to take a copper pipe or one made of iron or eagle's feathers, lower it onto the nail or hole, then pour a little hot water into the pipe.
Hold your hand and gently wiggle it while turning the pipe, causing the edge of the pipe to affect the root of the nail. The hot water then finds its way into the root of the nail, allowing the affected person a brief moment of discomfort from the hot water for a minute.
Then leave it, for the nail will come out with its roots. Do this to each one until you have dealt with all of them in the body. After they have come out, treat the areas with ointments that promote flesh growth.
The forty-fifth chapter.
In the case of popping noise.
If a popping sensation occurs in one of the nerves, or from a quarter fever or any other condition, it should be treated by heating four or five rods on the back between each rod of heat treatment, and in his chest area as well. And on his stomach, apply heat with an oil lamp iron, for the popping sensation subsides and speeds up the maturation of the cold illness.
The fifty-fifth chapter.
In cases where there is bleeding in the body.
Perhaps in the body, eruptions can occur which are disgusting masses made from cold, firm, rotten materials. It is necessary for these first appearances to be contained on top of every small, curative blister using a reed that has been lit at its tip or with a long tongs or with a convex lens hammer.
The pus may be contained in its first eruption on this condition, so it does not increase and the effectiveness of it dissipates, and it is cleared from impurity except that it should be after removing the impurity with scratching.
The Sixty-Fifth Chapter.
In cases of acute bleeding upon cutting the artery.
Bleeding often occurs from an artery that has been severed during a cut exposed to the outside, or upon making a slit in a tumor, or similar cases, and it is difficult to cut it.
If this happens to anyone, quickly move your hand towards the mouth of the artery and place your little finger on it, gently pulling until the blood is contained under your finger and nothing escapes from there. Then put a few small and large cotton wicks that are greased in fire until they become very hot.
Then, take one of them, either small or large depending on the wound and where the artery was severed. Place the iron onto the same vein after quickly removing your finger with a wheel and holding the iron until the bleeding stops.
If, upon lifting your finger from the mouth of the artery and extinguishing the iron, you take another iron with a wheel from the prepared greased iron rods. Continue doing this with one after another until the bleeding stops.
Preserve, do not burn the nerve. There are alternative explanations for what you hear on auscultation, and understand that if blood flows from a vessel, it cannot be cut under any circumstances, especially if the vessel is large, except with one of four methods: either by ligation as we said or by amputation if it has not been cauterized. If it is amputated, its ends contract and the blood flow stops. Alternatively, it can be ligated tightly with threads or, alternatively, medications that tend to stop the blood flow and tight binding by the forceps are applied.
As for those who attempt to cut it with a ligature or by tightening with the force, or placing burned objects and so forth, it does not stop there at all except in rare cases. If one exposes any of that without having a doctor or medicine present, he should pinch the index finger against the wound itself as we described.
He should tighten it greatly until the blood is squeezed and escapes from above the wound, on the vessel and the finger. The bleeding does not stop with cold water for an extremely long time until the blood congeals and hardens, and then it stops. During this period, you need to check whether you need a clamp or medicine.
The second chapter.
In the case of the cut, burn, fracture and surgeries, etc.
He said, Al-Khwarizmi mentioned in the first chapter all diseases that can be treated with fire and burned medicine, along with their reasons, causes, tools, and examples of burning equivalents. This was done as separate sections throughout history from antiquity to modern times.
And I follow this path in this chapter with the same method, making it easier for the student to achieve what is required...
Before I proceed with this, you my sons should know that in this section there are many complexities beyond what is contained within this section alone.
And for that reason, the caution should be stricter in this section because the work in this field often leads to the depletion of blood which supports life when a wound is opened or incision made on a tumor, an extraction from the body, surgery treatment, removal of an arrow or incision through a stone and so forth. These all come with many complications and fears and death occurs in most of them.
And I advise you to beware of what might cause doubt among you, for in this profession there are many people with various illnesses; some have become hardened by their illness and the death has humiliated them.
Due to the severity of their suffering and the length of their illnesses, as well as the impact of their illness on determining what indicates death, among them are those who have spent your money in hopes for recovery from you when their illness is deadly; they will not die easily. It should not be that you assist one who has this particular trait heavily.
Let your caution be stronger than your desire and concern. Do not proceed with anything of that without solid proof and certainty that it leads to the desired outcome. Use in all treatment for your illness, the advancement of knowledge and warning about what leads to safety.
In that, you will have support for gaining praise and glory, remembrance and gratitude. May Allah inspire you my sons to guide right direction, do not restrict yourselves from rectitude and success, as only He has control over it; there is no god but Him.
This section has been organized based on what was discussed in the previous chapter, from the 8th century to the ancient times, so that it may help alleviate your needs should God will it.
The First Chapter.
In the treatment of water that gathers at the heads of infants.
This particular type of scabies often affects infants at birth, if the midwife presses on the baby's head without gentleness. It may also occur for an unknown hidden reason that is not known.
I have not seen this cause in anyone other than infants, and all of those I saw from them died quickly, which is why I stopped practicing it. And among them was an infant whose head was full of water, and the head increased every day. Until he couldn't bear to sit on himself because of the size of his head and the moisture increased until it caused death.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone, or gathers under the bone on the scalp. The treatment in case the moisture is within the skin and bone, and if the tumor is small, it's necessary to make a single incision across the head until the moisture drains out. This is an image of how this operation was performed.
If the moisture is more and the tumor is larger, make two intersecting incisions like this:
And if the moisture is under the bone and its sign is that you can see scalp wrinkles from every side, water will decrease when you squeeze it with your hand inside; it should not be hidden from you. It's necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head like this:
After making the incision, all moisture is drained. The wounds are then tightened with sutures and bandages. At day five, water and oil are applied from above until the headband is removed. Then, the wound is treated with ointments and poultices without over-tightening the headband or feeding the patient only dry food with low moisture content.
Until the member strengthens and heals, another prescription is to observe where the bone of the tumor appears and the convergence of water because it may be at the back of the head more or in its front or on the right or in the north.
You are referring to the incision where the tumor is visible to you and the water accumulation, so you make an incision as much as possible and observe that you might cut a vessel causing bleeding. This bleeding will lead to the death of the patient due to that hemorrhage, along with the expulsion of moisture.
The second chapter.
Cutting the two vessels that are behind the ears, known as the hissiyis.
When someone experiences severe attacks affecting both eyes or the chest, and if medications have failed to provide relief after this point, inform about resorting to treating by cutting these two vessels.
If you wish to cut them, you should shave the patient's head according to Moses' method, then scrape the area with a coarse tool so that the vessel becomes visible. Then you should tighten the neck of the patient by pulling their cloak, and look where the veins pulse and their locations, the two prominent places behind the ears which are mostly exposed except in some people.
Then, learn the insertion points on them with a needle, and cut them with the cauterizing forceps down to the bone. This can be done across the head, but if you wish, you can insert the forceps from under the vessel up to above by cutting, and the length of the cut will be about two inches.
If the sweat, once interrupted, starts to bleed in a pulsating manner heading forward and spreading to the chest and body. If the vessel is not visible through touch, it might be necessary to estimate its location from behind the ear after counting three fingers. Then learn with a needle and cut until reaching the bone. It should be noted that...
Blood is sent through six routes of the medium and might send more or less, all according to your perception of the strength of the patient and the filling of their arteries. Then look at the wound; if there remains a piece of the fracture within the wound, cut it off.
To avoid exposure to a hot tumor, then bind the wound with a wick of cotton thread followed by treatment with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Suturing the two vessels in the grooves.
If someone experiences recurrent or sudden outbreaks due to dry heat and fever affecting the muscles of the grooves or severe chronic headache, among others, and various medical treatments fail to alleviate this, we have tried bleeding by puncturing the vessels in the grooves or their vicinity as described.
The purpose of bleeding is to shave the hair on the grooves, which refers to the visible vessel in the groove. From its pulsation, you can determine most things as only a few are hidden even among people.
Or when the cold is severe, it may hide from you. In this case, have the patient support his neck with a thick garment. Then mark the location with a wick or heat the area with hot water until the vessel becomes visibly and clearly present. Then take the scalpel, which is what it looks like. Then, using it very gently, you strip away the skin until you reach the vessel. After that, you place a string and pull it upwards so that it comes out of the skin. You remove any clots underneath from all sides. If the vessel is thin, twist its end with the string. Then remove part of it until the two ends are far apart and constrict, without causing bleeding. If it does not fall off or break, blood will not flow at all, then remove the blood from six to three places.
If the vein is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong doubled thread. The thread may be either from hemp or from the strings of the violin so that dirt does not reach the wound before the injury heals and causes bleeding.
Then cut a preference between the ligatures. Do this at that time or after another period, and if you want, seal it with iron using an iron knife until its ends fall off. This operation takes place exactly as described or better, as we said.
However, if there is fever or mood swings in the affected area because iron helps eliminate moisture, it becomes more effective and benefits better. It should be filled with dry cotton after tying both veins, and placed with tight ligatures. After healing, it is treated with medicinal herbs that promote wound healing, and vinegar until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding occurs during your work from the vein, proceed to cut it either with iron or fill the area with a ligature and tighten your hand until the blood stops. If this does not stop the bleeding, place your finger until the blood clots.
And let the area be cooled with intense cold water until the pain subsides and tighten as necessary, which is lighter and easier than tying both veins using this iron knife after learning their positions with the thread.
And lower it very gently until it reaches the bone and the sweat stops in two places so that what is between its ends can separate, for it will not adhere to this iron at all. This is an image of the iron knife.
The sharpness of the scalpel resembles that of two small needles, except it is much less sharper than a scalpel. If they were both as sharp as a scalpel, cold would come faster to them and the cutting of flesh wouldn't stop quickly. But if there is some hardness in them, fire's heat will stick on them.
The flesh was cut quickly, this work is better than every other action and it's lighter and easier. Let there be the thickness of a finger between the blades for hardness.
The Fourth Chapter.
In the treatment of excessive, constant flow of hot tears to the eyes.
If tears are constant and the flow comes from the channels on the forehead from outside, without any benefit from medical treatment with medicines, I saw the face of the unfortunate person had become reddened. He feels a stinging sensation on his forehead like that of an insect bite, and both his eyes are hanging wetted. His eyelids have become swollen from the intensity of tears which have soaked them. Faced with this, the first resort in its treatment is this act, they call it sword medicine. It involves having the unfortunate person shave off the hair on their forehead.
Then, three cuts are made on the forehead. These cuts run parallel to each other along the forehead. The length of each cut is approximately the length of an inch, with one cut aligned parallel to the nose in the center of the forehead, the second slightly behind the muscle movement at the jaw, and the third on the opposite side.
Be careful not to cut the two veins on the sides. Keep your hand away from where the jaws connect. Leave three inches between each cut and have a sponge or a wet wipe ready, as they will soak up blood.
Then the sharp forceps, which is depicted in this picture, is introduced. From the cut following the bite to the central cut, all the skin between the two cuts is peeled off along with the inflammation on the bone. This procedure is also done from the central cut to the third cut, and then this forceps is removed. Another device is also introduced in the first cut, called a sharp scalpel on one side and smooth but not sharp on the other. This is its picture:.
She makes her sharp side towards the flesh attached to the skin and her smooth side towards the bone, pushing it until she reaches the central cut, cutting with it all the blood vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then, she performs this in the middle cut to the other cut, after letting out an amount of blood considered moderate, she squeezes the places with clotted blood. Then, for each cut, she inserts a cotton thread and applies a poultice made from a drink, oil or honey and oil on it.
In order to prevent a hot tumor, on the third day the bandage is removed and she uses a lot of wet cotton wool. Then, it is treated with the basilics ointment with rose oil and other remedies used for wounds until it heals if God willing.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from inside the head.
When one experienced frequent severe discharges, you see his eyes drooping and tiny, with weakened vision. The eyelids are swollen and the eyebrows are falling out. In the depth of the head, there is an intense sharp pain and continuous coughing. From these symptoms, it should be known that such substances and discharges come from numerous deep veins. The best treatment in such cases is this method: order the sick person to shave their forehead then make a single cut down the middle of the forehead.
In the depth of the head, there is an intense sharp pain and continuous coughing. From these symptoms, it should be known that such substances and discharges come from numerous deep veins. The best treatment in such cases is this method: order the sick person to shave their forehead then make a single cut down the middle of the forehead. Or lift it slightly upwards and start the cut from the left corner of the mouth to the right corner of the mouth. The cut should go towards the bone, and when you hold your hand away from the moving muscles near the jaw while chewing until the bone is exposed and all blood is wiped up with a sponge.
Separate the edges of the incision with a cotton thread or a cotton thread, then pull from above using the sutures and soak the sutures in water and oil to prevent a hot lump from forming. Once you have cleared it, if you see that the hot lump has disappeared, it is necessary to cut into the bone so that new tissue begins to grow.
Then, treat it with a dried process that promotes tissue growth like taking two parts of buckwheat flour and four parts of thyme. Prepare a paste from them and use it to promote tissue growth in such surgeries.
The Sixth Chapter.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is of four kinds: either a metallic rock like iron or glass, or a plant seed like chickpeas and kernels, etc., or something liquid such as water and vinegar, etc.
And if it's an animal, when a stone or something similar to the stone that doesn't grow in the ear falls into the ear, receive the ear towards sunlight. If you see that the stone has become somewhat greasy with some almond oil or camphor oil, then try to remove it by moving your head or blowing out with a feather. Stopping the ear leaks after coughing when a string of leather or wool is placed around the ear and the ear is pulled upwards. This treatment often results in its removal if it doesn't, then try to remove it with a gentle pick as depicted here.
If it comes out with the pick, otherwise try to remove it with a slightly curved blunt awl. If it doesn't come out from that either, make an asbest and insert one end of the tube into the ear hole deeply.
Seal around the tube with oiled plaster so that there is no path for the wind except through the tube, then pull it with your breath strongly and frequently. Often enough it will come out in this way, if it doesn't come out as we described and instead take a little from honey or finely prepared bird food which is used to catch birds and place it at the end of the applicator.
After tightly wrapping it around, then gently insert it into the ear hole after wiping out moisture from the ear. If it doesn't come out even after all that we've described, proceed to make an incision before a hot tumor or twitching occurs.
The incision recipe is to cut the wax in the ear canal first and bleed it according to its strength, then place the wax between your hands and turn its back upwards. Make a small incision at the base of the ear where the fat is located on the lower part.
The incision should be in a crescent shape until you reach the stone, then remove it as much as possible with tools. Then stitch up the cut quickly and treat it until it heals.
If the thing falling in your ear is one of the seeds that grow and inflate, try to remove it with what was mentioned. If this doesn't work for removal, take a fine, delicate burr as shown here.
Try to remove this type of falling seeds from the ear. If you are certain that this seed has become moistened with the ear vapor until it becomes many small pieces, then remove it using the dark lamp or a soft brush or by suction.
As we mentioned, it makes it easier to remove. As for water in the ear, it should be expelled using coughing on a camphor stick first. If he is lying down with something of old cotton stuffed into his ear, then if he is able to expel it through this method.
Otherwise, take a large number of small sand grains along your fingers and heat them with fire slightly. Then, insert one of these camphor pieces into his ear and blow on one of his feet from that side. Strike another stone on the stone in the ear.
He continues doing this with grain after grain until all the water is removed. Water can be expelled by taking one of the goose feathers or ice, inserting only one end into the ear and heating the other end with fire until most of it burns. Then another feather is repeated.
You do this several times until all the water is removed or it is sucked out with a tube as described earlier in the sand section. As for removing any animal that might be inside, observe if its body size is small like a fish and similar objects; then you should use what was mentioned in the division for such cases.
If its body is large and can be felt with the hand, try to remove it using a soft brush and tubes; this will make it easier than all other things that might occur in the ear. As for removing the wax worm from the ear if you treated it as described in our section on insects without wax, then your treatment did not succeed.
You should look into the ear towards the sun, if you see a bit of wax, remove it with tweezers or fine forceps. If you do not see anything from them, take this tube to picture its image.
It is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. Insert a delicate tip into the ear to the extent that it can bear, then insert the strong hook inside the ear. Do this several times until all wax comes out. If no progress for its removal, seal around the tube with candles as I explained to you in case of stone.
If the wax does not come out as we have described, use the devices I mentioned. These were first tried in removing wax and you will find them explained in an article about these instruments. Using this machine allows for pouring of medicines or oils into the ear like this: [illustration provided]
As you see, it is made of silver or brass. It's narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. If desired, the pump inside the tube can be made of tight-fitting brass. Alternatively, you can take a hollow reed and wrap it tightly on its tip with a piece of string.
Then pour the oil or juice or any other medicine you want into the tube, and then place it in the ear. Insert the wick of cotton from above and squeeze it moderately with your hand until the oil flows into the auditory canal, which will feel good.
Place the wick inside, and ensure that whatever you place in the ear has been slightly warmed by fire. Be careful not to let the substance that rotates within it be too cold or excessively hot. The ear cannot tolerate this.
Chapter Seven.
In the treatment of wax blockage in the ear.
Some children may exit their mothers' wombs and their ears' canals unscarred.
And it may also expose some individuals to a plug in the ear canal due to a wound or a新生 tissue there. This plug could be inside the depth of the ear hole, not visible by sight.
It may project slightly outside the hole and be visible. The one that is in depth of the ear but not visible usually makes it hard to see. The one that is visible, you should place the deaf's ear in the sun. Inspect it, and if you see the plug clearly, open it with a gentle pair of forceps; here's what this would look like:.
It will have a slightly protruding tip that is somewhat limited, and the rest of the forceps are smooth to avoid injuring the ear. If the plug is growing tissue in the ear canal, hold it with a soft hook and cut it gently until all the tissue is removed.
If the plug is in depth of the ear, take a gentle smooth probe and heat it slightly over fire. Then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the plug along with what the deaf person experiences from loss of hearing, gently remove it carefully.
Be careful not to cut the eardrum, then place a wick in the ear up to the size of the hole that fits it properly. Do this for days until you are sure that there is no risk of wound healing or take a bit of the wick and dip it in water, then rub it with powdered zinc.
Use it if you see the ear has swollen and place a hot wick inside. It should be expected that you remove this wick and replace it with another one, which was soaked in camphor made from rose oil to soothe the hot swelling. Then treat it until it heals.
If there is bleeding, immerse a sponge or a hole in cold water and place it on the ear. Use all treatments that stop the mentioned bleeding as described in "The Book of Remedies".
The eighth chapter.
In treating the drops that appear on the cheeks.
These drops that appear on the eyelids may be wet or dry. They should be held with tweezers or pincers and cut from their roots using scissors. Then they should be placed in position with some powder.
If there is bleeding from it, treat it with a soft eyeglass forceps. It's better to do this after cutting and it often returns if there is something left of its roots. If you heat it with fire, those roots will be burned and it won't return.
The ninth chapter.
In treating the frost that appears on the cheeks of the eye.
Very often, there is something resembling frost in intensity and hardness on the cheeks of the eye.
And that's why it is called frost; it's the assembly of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The work here is to look, if you find the frost protruding from the eyelid, move towards every side; thus, treating it is easy; you just have to cut through it with a horizontal incision.
Then, gently scrape it from every side until you remove it completely. Hang it with pincers and cut it. If you can't cut it right away after the cutting of the eyelid, this does not harm anything in your absence. If the incision is large, stitch it together and treat it until it heals.
And if it's small, don't worry about it; the ointment will push and bind it. If the eyelid is inclined towards the inner eyelid towards the inside surface, turn the eyelid and hang the lid with a loop without needing to cut and pierce it from every side.
And if you remove the eyelid by cutting, it will not harm. Then wash the eye with salty water after removing the lid and treat the area with something that binds until the eye heals.
The Tenth Chapter.
In treating the condition of double eyelid that appears in the eyelid.
The double eyelid is a patch that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid. This condition mostly affects boys, making their eyes look heavy and prone to suffering from frequent night sweats. They often cannot bear to look at sunlight. In order that tears hasten towards them.
Therefore, you see them always reclining on their faces and they sleep with that position. Their eyelids under the eyebrows are wet due to frequent tears caused by this condition. The double eyelid is very obvious; when you touch the area between them with your fingers, you can feel it. The purpose of the operation is for the patient to place his head in a hole made in your seat during the process.
Then, take a thread of cotton and make from it a wick. Create a circle with that wick as large as what surrounds the double eyelid on all sides. Place it on the affected area and pinch it from all sides using your fingers to gather the extra skin in the center of the circle.
Then, cut through the center of this wet area with a cutting device (mbabus al-nashel) making a horizontal incision. The width of the cut should not be larger than the seam in the eyelid. In depth, it is necessary to cut all the skin down to the double eyelid.
In most cases, the cornea protrudes from the incision in the form of a piece of white fat. You then use a tool to pull it out between your fingers and take care to move your hand back and forth so as to free it, being careful not to cut too deeply to avoid damaging the eye with the forceps.
If the cornea does not appear in the first incision, it may be necessary to increase the depth of the cut slightly and gently until the cornea appears. Then you can pull it out as we have described, then dip a tool in vinegar and water, place it on the spot, and tighten it with a clamp. Some people press it with salt.
He places it in the cavity of the cut so that what remains of this moisture dissolves. Then he treats it until it heals. If there was an injury and a hot substance occurred at the site, he treated it with soothing ointment until it healed.
The eleventh chapter.
In the methods of ophthalmic surgery.
If a supernumerary eyelash grows outside the natural path beneath the natural lashes in the eye lid, it can harm the eye and cause various illnesses such as constant tearing, drooping of the eyebrows, whitening and cloudiness, to the extent that this becomes a cause for the loss of vision.
Eyebrow surgery can be done in four ways: either by burning with fire as explained in the section on fire, or by using a strong medicine as mentioned earlier, or it can be done through cutting and suturing, or using thread as I have described.
You should place the needle on your eyelid, then turn the eye lid with your left hand. If it turns properly, otherwise put in a needle from under the eyelash and pierce the needle with thread from above, making sure to pull the thread close to the hair itself and bring the thread up by pulling on the eyelash.
Turn it over with the scalpel, then cut into the inner lid skin beneath the excess hair by incising from the larger opening to the smaller one. Next, pull the thread and place a small cotton or linen pad under the eyelid, then stitch the lid shut.
Like the shape of an ace card, but it should be in proportion to how much you want to lift the eyelid because this can vary among people; some may need a cut from the eyelid that is suitably sized according to how relaxed the eyelid has become.
And some may require even less of this cut according to how relaxed the eyelid is, then you would incise with the scalpel along the two lines that you have marked and begin from the larger opening to the smaller one. The incision should be close to natural hair line as thin as a needle's prick.
Then, the needle enters one of the corners of the skin, then excises it all. The lips are stitched together with a needle and fine silk thread, wiping away the blood. Some things attached to eyebrows will be used to stick what is left of the threads on the eyebrows.
You may choose to do this or not, but it doesn't matter either way. The stitches and threads should remain in place for around three or four days before you proceed with the treatment. If desired, the wound can be left unsewn and treated with things that dry out and tighten; when the wound heals, lifting of the eyelid occurs at the site of closure, and stitching is indeed preferable.
This aspect of the surgery, I mentioned earlier, however it imposes some burden on the patient, but it works well and there is no danger involved. Another aspect in this procedure is that you stitch the eyelid in a shape like an ace card as described. Then the eyelid is lifted with three needles which may be separate or grouped like this image.
Then, the preferred part of the eyelid is cut with small scissors as shown in this image, cuts are made moderately:.
If you are unable to hold the needles, take an awl with a thread and insert it in the middle of this figure and insert another thread close to the inner corner and a third thread close to the outer corner, gather the threads between your fingers moderately then lift your hand slightly.
Then lift the taught skin as we have described. Sew both lips of the wound with stitches and heal it until it heals. If a heated lump appears when you cut or make incisions, treat that lump with camphor and other soothing ointments.
And the lower eyelid may also reverse its lashes, it should use what we mentioned about cutting and stitching and burning with fire or medicine, and burning with fire or medicine stronger yet milder than cutting and stitching in them I would do more careful.
Burning with the stick is done in this way; you flip the eyelid and cut the incision from inside as described, then make two or three pointed twigs of wood long along the length of the eyelid and shorter than the width of the pliers.
And I have borrowed from each end of both sides, where the threads stick. Then gather them gently on the preferred part of the eyelid and pull the twigs firmly from each side for a tightness and leave it for some days. The tightened skin dies, turns black and rots.
Until it leaves on its own, if it slows down, give her a loan then treat her until she recovers. If her fever decreases and the swelling of her eyelid does not diminish, these are the two eyelashes which you create in this manner and size with respect to length and width in each eye.
The second chapter.
In lifting the lost hair from the eye by using needles.
If it is a hair or two that need to be worked on, then take a fine needle and insert into it a thread of very fine silk that has been smoothed out. Then gather its ends and tie them with a very loose knot, let the length of the thread be about a yard.
Then place another fine thread in the needles shorter than it and tie its ends if you wish, then let the patient lie his head on your stone near the sun so that he can see the work well because it is a meticulous task. Then insert the needle into the root of the excessive hair with the threads.
And execute it on the eyelid with rapid strokes until it comes out above the natural hair. Then pull the thread up over the needles and enter that hair, whether it's one or two or three hairs no more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out along with the needles in the eyelid together with the natural hair. If you pulled the needles and didn't extract the hair with them, you pulled the needles downwards with that thread which was fastened in the needles until they come out of the upper hole.
Then put the hair back in and pull it out again. Do this until it rises in the upper hole and you see it with the eye, then remove the needles and the thread and take them out and tighten the eye and leave it tight for two or three days until it binds the hair in its place and grows flesh on it.
If the stitch is short, either you add a long hair from your natural hair to it and it rises with it, or you leave it until it grows longer, then when that happens, you remove it.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the treatment of the hairrow that occurs in the upper eyelid.
The one affected by this hairrow is called an arnbia. This hairrow can be either natural or accidental. The accidental one results from a wound, a cut, or a tear, and so on.
The purpose of the treatment is to cut through this conglomeration and separate its two parts, making a thread appear between them. Then you should tie it until it heals. It's not advisable to use things that dry or tighten in her treatment.
If you do this, the hairrow will return more strongly than it was. Instead, use things that relax such as the loop and the tenter in water with a little soap and cotton syrup lotion dissolved in some oil, then apply it, treated it.
The essence of its treatment is to employ every trick not to reattach in the same form as it was initially. This action we mentioned, however, is some repair for the hairrow and not to return the condition of the place according to how it originally was.
The fourteenth chapter.
In the treatment of the hairrow that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This hairrow that occurs at the bottom is what we actually call a hairrow and can be natural or accidental. The accidental one results from a wound, a cut, or a tear, among other things.
The method in this is to take a needle with two threads within it, and pierce the flesh with it, then continue it from the left incision to the right until the thread becomes inside both parts of the flesh. Then raise the flesh above by means of the needle, and cut it with a broad scissor.
If the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, and otherwise if you take a thread and place it at the site of the cut and turn the eyelid with it to make two cuts in the inner side of the eyelid. The ends of these cuts come from the corners of the cut that was made until they meet forming an angle. Until if it has gathered, its shape becomes similar to this form:.
And it is the Greek letter lamda, then remove that flesh as much as its sharp side is below what follows the eyelid. Then gather the scattered parts with two threads and sew it with wool thread, then treat it with the medicines we mentioned for relaxation and swelling until it heals.
And if the swelling has spread from a cut or stitch or otherwise as should be, then make a simple incision without hair and proceed it between the lips with swelling on what we mentioned.
And the rule for treating swelling from above or below is to perform the work according to whatever you determine about the shape of the swelling, as it may have many variations in appearance. The surgeon devises a method using any available means.
Until it returns to its natural shape or comes close to it, and the same disease guides you on what is suitable for its treatment and tools in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
In connecting the eyelid to the lid edge or cornea.
This fusion may be misunderstood by many as attaching the upper lid to the white of the eye, which hinders its easy movement and impedes natural actions. It is necessary that a fold stick enter beneath the eyelid.
Lift it upwards or extend it with a hinge, then cut the attachment with a gentle clamp that doesn't have a sharp cutting edge but is slightly blunt to avoid worrying the patient as the clamp will hurt the eye if too sharp. Your cut should be like removing this attachment.
Even when the eyelid returns to its natural position and all the adhesion is healed, you can expect that after it heals completely, pour in the eye some salty water to wash it or sprinkle some camel's foot dust dissolved in water inside. Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a cotton thread.
Place over the eye a cotton ball soaked in egg white, and use the prepared camel's foot until it heals after the third day.
The sixteenth chapter.
In cutting the nail and removing its pus.
The nail can be in two forms, either it is nervous resembling a hard and thin scab, or it is not nervous, resembling a white moist dryness if it comes into contact with iron or it breaks when taken off by a hinge.
If the hinge did not stick, and both types start from the larger opening until it becomes a little by little covering the eye and preventing light and movement of the eye. The work in cutting it is that the patient places his head on your knee.
Then he opens his eyes and lifts the eyelid with your hand, then catches the nail with a very slightly bent needle and raises it up. Then he takes a thread made from horse or cow hair, or strong thread, and bends one end of the needle slightly before piercing the middle of the nail.
Then she performs it using the needle, ties the nail with the thread and raises it up. Then she cuts along the side of the nail next to the eye as if spreading it outwards with the hair, until she reaches the end of the nail, then she cuts off the rest of the nail in its root using a gentle pair of scissors or small scissors. She leaves the natural nail untouched.
So as not to expose the possibility of constant tears after cutting, the nail is extended with the needle alone or by using thread as we mentioned, then trimmed with a smooth pair of scissors whose end looks like this:.
And she protects against the scissors coming into contact with the corneal membrane causing it to tear, resulting in watering of the eye. After cutting, she puts a little powdered salt or wormwood herb in the eye and leaves it until another day, then treats her as necessary until she recovers.
If the nail is not sensitive and cannot be penetrated by a needle or a bent wire, this type of nail is often treated with medicine until it heals as described in the section. If you want to cut it, open the eye of the patient.
Take a smooth, gentle pair of scissors like this:. Gently remove the nail from above by scraping. If you see that it's breaking and tearing, scrape only with a sharp edge of your eyelid on wormwood or red wormwood or powdered salt, then pull the eye until another day.
Then, continue the operation until all is gone except if a hot tumor obstructs your view; leave it and treat the hot tumor until it heals, then resume the operation with weighing (of ingredients) until it heals, as for those prone to infection.
If it causes a terrible hurt to the eye due to being near it, suspend that nuto with a thread and cut off some of it. Do not be too intent in cutting as this may cause tearing up of tears then rinse in cold water or in water mixed with red henna or zinger until it heals.
The Seventeenth Chapter.
In cutting the varicose veins and what grows as excess flesh in the eye.
Red flesh may grow in the eyes of some people covering or getting close to, or overflowing onto the cheeks, and perhaps the eyelids turn outward resembling varicose veins.
The procedure is for the patient to lie down with his head on your pillow, then open his eyes and collect all that red flesh using tweezers matching this.
Or you might hold it with forceps or a comb. You would cut the first piece of flesh one by one, until all is cut away and be careful not to harm the eye during this process. Your cuts should either use the knife we described for cutting the hoof or a small pair of scissors. Like this as shown in this following image, when you would use the tweezers on what is about to be seen in this door.
When your cutting is complete and all varicose veins have disappeared, fill the eye with powdered salt or rinse it with red substances and other strong medicines. Then hold a piece of white cotton over the eye from outside to cool down the hot tumor.
If there is something left of the reddening, and your patient's blood has been drained out, and you fear that the hot tumor might remain, leave the eye alone and treat it with what calms down the tumor. Then proceed to work on her until she recovers. Similarly, do this process for the excess flesh that appears in the eye of this kind.
Except that you must avoid treating any weak eye through the method of imprint or display by working with iron, and do not touch anything from these operations until you see that this organ is suitable for such work.
The eighteenth chapter.
In the operation for removing the bridge from the eye.
The spouts are red vessels that weave over the eye, which prevents vision and weakens the eye with time. It is your first task to examine; if the eye having the spouts is strong and doesn't have any other disease beside the spouts, then it should be treated accordingly.
In that case, the operation is as follows: you should ask the patient to place his head on your stone. Then hang those veins with one or two threads depending on your ability; make sure the threads are gently hung in this manner:.
Or, you might have two double threads in one body like this:.
Then, using a gentle scalpel, you should delicately cut those veins without causing any bleeding. Wait until blood appears, then clean it step by step until the eye is freed from these veins and the blood has disappeared. Take care not to harm the eye with the edges of the scalpel. Your work for that day should be half in the shade of the sun.
Ensure your work is precise, so that you do not cut anything other than the veins. When finished, sew up the green or red scar in the eye to eat away at whatever remains of the spouts with its sharpness. If you are unable to perform the operation completely at that moment, bandage the eye with what soothes the eye pain.
Leave him for some days until the pain subsides and the heat of the lump settles. Then resume working on this method with the same tool until this picture of pain disappears from her.
Leave him [so that the teacher's head is on the student's stone and at the end tears are flowing and he achieves the vision in front of his eyes and its tip] at the beginning of work, opening the eye with fixed or triangular openings holding them by the student.
Fixed, so that the teacher's head is on the student's stone and at the end tears are flowing and he achieves vision in front of his eyes and its tip. By choice, you can start with a pinch from above the eye or below it, and the first one is two wrinkles in the upper eyelid, where one is at the end of the eyeline and the other is at the beginning.
Hold it between the center and the middle then attach tubes under them. Then hold it between the belly button and the heel, then remove your hand slightly to see all the parts rising, cut with a small knife if you are using a scalpel, or use a gentle file if that's what you have.
The practitioner enters the needle and ensures all parts are cut until they rise above the skin without cutting off any tears, as tearing may cause blood and tears to leak onto you.
Then cut with the scalpel what is above and below the eyebrow until nothing but the edge remains in the corner. If possible, you can lift it from the corner and peel off using the needle; this is better as some people might find it easier.
When you cut him, his beard area will heal for days until the pain subsides and he recovers from the heat of the lump. Then resume working on him.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In pushing the hair back to the nose.
Doctors call the treatment for hair, Nasour, if they treat it with fire or the hot burn medicine as previously described and it doesn't heal. If this is the case, then there's no trick other than to cut into the tumor when it matures and remove all the moisture in it or pus.
Until the bone is exposed. If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or darkness in it, remove it with this instrument depicted here:.
It is called the iron pick, made of Indian iron. Its head is shaped like a nail and it bears a delicate engraving on its surface, like that of an engraver's tool or an engraving chisel. You place it on the area of corruption in the bone and turn it between your fingers as you slightly move your hand until you know that this corruption has been removed.
You perform this action several times, then apply the medicine which is dried and tightly squeezed. If the area closes up, grows flesh there, and its healing process stops within the set period of time (presumably referring to a specific medical procedure duration), then it lasts for forty days without recurring, nor any new symptoms appearing in that area.
Know that it has healed, otherwise there's no trick other than pushing the Nasour hair back into the nasal cavity in this manner. This involves exposing the bone again either with iron or a hot medicine; if the bone is exposed, take hold of it like so:
The tip of the tool is triangular and its body conical, tapering towards the tip as you can see. Place it on the bone itself, with the part being close to your nose and slightly away from your eye. Then move your hand with the tool until the bone penetrates and reaches the sighted person.
Let him find the wind coming out if he holds his hand over his nose, then force the place with the compressed and dried medicaments as you were taught. When the flesh has grown and hardened in that spot, the material that used to exude will return to the nose becoming easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
The translation of your Arabic text is "The eye muscles will be restored.
If the eye has been removed with its socket, and there is no disease or loss in vision, it should be hoped that the patient will recover. Then, this process should be detailed further, then a piece of bone must be placed in the orbit without any condition, followed by suction using a gentle technique.
Then place a poultice made of wheat bran, flour, butter and mutton fat on the eye. After that, pull up the eyelid from above using many elastic bands. The description for the elastic bands is to take a lot of soft thread, which when each stitch is made turns into four layers forming many layers.
Then, place one on top of another according to what your eye needs, and pull it tight with a hard stitch firmly. Reapply the suction without any condition then remove the suction device, leaving the eye pulled tight for a day and night.
If the ligament relaxes during this process, it should be pulled gently. Remove the bandage after one day and night as we said. If I see that the eye has returned, otherwise, reapply the padding, elastic bands, pulling, and suction until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
Regarding the removal of the hymen.
If a blister appears on the albanian skin layer, then it leaks and protrudes outside the eyes like raisins, disfiguring human appearance. If one wants to cut it, work according to what I describe.
And this is to insert a needle into the base of the raisin, from bottom to top, then insert another needle with a double thread on its side and run it through. Leave the first needle as it is.
Then cut the place where the double thread has bent, tie some of the raisin around the needle and pull it tightly. Then remove the needle and place a piece of wool soaked in egg white on the eye, leave it until the threads fall with the raisin. Then treat the eye to strengthen it.
Until the wound heals, pull the raisin from all sides in a circle using a needle until the eye becomes softer and smoother. Then press with a fine clamp that reaches the eye socket so that the white moisture flows out of the eye, it descends and relaxes on the seat, then tighten until healing occurs.
The second and twenty-first chapter.
In treating the boil.
This condition, which is called the boil, is a gathering within the eye that resembles water that has risen but lacks it. The reason for action in this is to place the patient upright on a chair, then take his head with your hands from both sides.
And move him until you see the fluid descend to your eye, then fix it and don't remove it. Light shines through, the patient sees things as he used to see them. If it doesn't descend below this, we know that is water. If it isn't ready for the descent of the fluid as mentioned.
Otherwise, place the weak one in front of you then take a thin knife and cut slightly above the corneal epithelium's membrane within the limbus until you remove the substance.
If only hot water, mixed with milk or water in which a date and milk have been cooked, comes out of the eye, treat it with all other treatments until it heals.
The twenty-third chapter.
We have mentioned the types of water in the previous section and which one is suitable for the application, explained with clear understanding. Take it from there on health grounds; then you should place the weak one between your hands sitting upright towards the light near the sun.
And you tie the healthy eye and pull it tightly, then lift its eyelid with your left hand if the water is in the left eye or with your right hand if it's in the right eye.
Then place the tip of the syringe near the limbus with a tight pressure on the whiteness of the eye from the inner corner. Then push the syringe with force while you are moving it with your hand until it enters the white part of the eye and you feel that the syringe has reached an empty thing.
It should be that the depth of the syringe's passage to the eye's depth is equal to the distance from the child to the end of the dark spot, which is the limbus of the eye. You see it as you look through the glass in front of your eyes due to the clarity of the corneal surface. Then adjust the syringe upwards until you reach the place where the water is.
Then, pressing it down repeatedly, each time water descends from his instrument, the wetness observes what his eye had opened on his instrument and is in his eye. Then he lets it rest for a little while. If the water ascends, he descends it again without having to remove the tool.
And when it stabilizes and does not ascend, remove the tool gently while moving your hand with it a little bit at a time. Then dissolve a tiny amount of pure inland salt in water and use this to wash inside the eye from within. Afterwards, place all of it externally - either with a thread or with soft wool that has been dipped.
Apply a mixture of rose water and egg white, then bind the correct eye with it. However, in our time and in times past, we place crushed nutmeg mixed with the egg white on it. If the tool cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, some people's eyes are so hard that the tool won't fit inside. You should take the forceps which is called 'the bird', as shown below:.
Pierce only the hair with it, not the skin. It's just about touching the place where you hit, then enter the tool as we've described. After finishing your work, prepare for the wetness to lie down firmly and sleep on its back in a dark room.
All movements are avoided, as well as coughing. Provide him with food that softens his constitution and does not move his head left or right at all. Keep the bandage in place until the third day. Then let him rest in this dark room and test his sight.
Show him things, then tighten the bandage until the seventh day. It is not advisable to do this during treatment or immediately after irrigation with your tool. You should avoid it before water starts to ascend quickly due to intense observation.
If a hot tumor appears, it should be treated before the seventh day and that can be done by what calms the tumor until it becomes calm. Then he can open his eye and place a headscarf on its face to train his vision from under it for days while he is in this dark room.
He gradually leaves the house and gets involved in its affairs, know that the student of al-Khwarizmi cannot do without observation sometimes, then he proceeds to work. I have heard from some Iraqis that they make an effective abacus in Iraq that absorbs water.
No one in our country has made this or read it in any of the early books, and perhaps it might be new. Here is a picture of various types of abacuses that could stand in for him due to his ignorance:.
It is made of brass specifically, and its end has this same smoothness, with the tip at the end being sharp like a triangle.
The Twenty-Fourth Chapter.
In treating the proliferating flesh in the nose.
Certainly, the nose may develop various types of flesh growths. Some resemble spiders with many legs, and among them is a type that looks like cancerous flesh that turns colors. Others have flesh that is slimy and not similar to the color of the skin.
If these kinds of flesh are soft, neither poisonous nor cancerous, it should be that you let the patient sit in front of the sun with their incision open and put salt on those flesh parts then draw them out. Then cut what has been identified using a fine sharp scalpel from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has disappeared, if there's still something left that you couldn't cut, remove it with one of the soft and gentle machines until nothing is left. If the blood overwhelms or a hot tumor appears.
In response to what is necessary or if it involves malignant tumors, proceed with their removal until the bleeding stops and all tissues are gone. Then, after the cutting in the nose, take a piece of gutta-percha or water, or some drink. If the nose opens up and its moisture flows down to the throat.
Know that he is cured, if the moisture doesn't spread as it should, know that there is soft tissue above the deteriorating bones inside him which has not reached the instrument by the cut. In such a case, you should take a thread of cotton that has some thickness to it.
It ties many knots, with each knot being the size of an inch or less. The operator inserts the end of a single thread into his nose either in a snaking manner or as possible after he has made it like a needle and draws its air until it reaches the nostril.
It passes through his neck and it often happens that boys who are copyists do this action, which is a simple task for those who want to perform it. Then, the end of the thread that emerged from the mouth meets with the other end which remained in the nose.
Then, the flesh is spread using the knots on the string. This action is done until you realize that the tissues have been severed by the string knots. Then, the string is removed and after wiping off blood residues that she had soaked in Egyptian ointment for three or more days.
Until the ointment eats up all that is left of the flesh. Then, the last thing in the nose is a copper tube for several days until it heals. If he needs treatment, let him dry this method.
And here is a picture of the instrument with which fluids and medications drip into the nose:.
It places a semi-candelabrum made of silver or copper open at the end and with its lumen treated similarly.
And if you wish, I can make the tube closed like a pipe and flatten the edge of the spoon where it touches.
It has a handle at the end, as you see, it holds when you heat up the wax or any other juices or liquid items that you wish.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
In the nights of pregnancy in the tip of the nose.
It often grows hairs in the tip of the nose, which grow larger and increase over time until it spoils its appearance.
Therefore, it should be cut at the first appearance of hair and all of it should be removed. Then apply either honey or a burned medicine that serves as honey, if you miss cutting it until it grows larger, then look; if it is tightly twisted hard like a little bit of color with little sensitivity, it needs to be treated accordingly.
Do not expose it to iron as it is a cancerous tumor. I have seen many cases where after removing this tumor, a great ulcer occurred in its owner, and if the tumor is soft and not like little color, then I saw that it can be removed completely. Drain the pus and cut it without caution or hesitation, treat the area with what dries and constricts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In Nasal, lip and ear缝ing. If its connection separates from the wound or something like that, know that whenever there is a separation of connection in any of these organs, only some of the work may affect it.
When you present something of this to one, check whether the wound is moist with its blood. If it is so, stitch together both edges of the cut then treat until it heals. But if the connection has split and each incision is clean, it is necessary that you excise each incision by peeling off the superficial skin until it heals.
Then stitch the edges together and tighten it, apply paste of ghee and curd on it, place a piece of ointment plaster or any other plasters above it. Leave it tightened for two or three days then remove it.
And change the medicine and leave it until the threads cut off themselves, then treat with ointment until it heals. The process of stitching is that you gather and separate the connection either by needle as we described in stitching the abdomen or by thread as I taught you there.
The twenty-seventh chapter.
In releasing the bandage presented in the two lips.
Many people may show you small hard growths inside their mouths that resemble some chestnuts and others are smaller or larger, it is necessary to flip the lip and cut through each knot and hang them by a string.
And cut it from both sides, then fill the place after cutting with a poultice until the blood stops, then rinse with vinegar, salt and treat the places until there is a healing grip until the wounds heal.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In cutting the excess flesh in the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums which the early generations called 'Apols'. It is necessary to hang it by a string or tie it with a chisel and cut it at its root. Leave until bleeding stops then place a poultice of powder on the area.
Or any detached dried tissue, if that flesh returns after treatment, it often comes back as scarred. Therefore, you should cut it again and suture it; he will not return after sewing.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In counting the teeth with iron.
Crusts of rough, unpleasant texture may congregate on the surfaces of teeth both inside and outside, as well as between gums. These can darken, turn yellow or green; in severe cases this decay spreads into the gum tissue, resulting in erosion of the teeth.
You need to have the patient seated in front of you, with their head resting on a stone. You should remove the affected tooth and any visible parts that resemble sand from inside it until nothing remains, just as you do for darkening, greenish, or whitened areas and anything else like so until cleanliness is achieved.
If the initial counting is removed and then redone another day, secondly and thirdly until you reach your desired outcome. Remember that each tooth may require different types of counting with various shapes according to what suits your work.
In order that the inside tooth extractor differs from the outside one, and they differ among each other. You have prepared several types of tooth extractors all.
The Thirty-first Chapter.
In extracting the teeth.
It is necessary to treat the tooth for pain by all means, refusing extraction if possible because there is no 'behind' in a tooth after extraction; it's a valuable essence. Even when extraction seems inevitable.
It is necessary if the patient decides to have their tooth extracted, that you firmly set it until the tooth stops hurting. The insufficiency of pain often deceives a patient, making them believe that the discomfort is in the correct spot. As a result, they have the afflicted area removed, but the pain persists until the diseased part is actually excised. We have witnessed this repeatedly among surgeons.
If the source of pain is correctly identified in a specific area, then you should make incisions around the tooth with a tool that has some strength. Do this until the gum is removed from all sides. Then, move it with your fingers or soft forceps at first, very gently, gradually, until it loosens.
Then, he can apply the two large pliers firmly and the patient's head is held between his knees. The pain has subsided so much that it doesn't move anymore. Then, pull the tooth straight in order not to break it. If it doesn't come out completely or if it does, grab one of those tools and gently place it under him from every side, then move it like you did before.
If the tooth is embedded or rooted, it should be filled with a probe to fill that hole and seal it tightly with a soft, gentle tip so it doesn't come off when you pull on it with forceps. It's necessary to gently explore around the gum from every side.
Hold back your strength so you don't break it, leaving some behind that will cause more discomfort to the patient than his original pain. Avoid doing what the ignorant surgeons do like on a bridge, removing without using the method we described.
Indeed, it happens often that they cause great sufferings to people instead of making the situation easier for them; such as breaking the tooth and leaving all or part of its root. Either he removes some of the jaw bones as we have seen repeatedly, then rinses the area after removal with a drink or with a mixture of salt and water, if there is bleeding from the spot this happens often, so compress something from the zagg (a type of gauze) and stuff it into the place.
And if the zagg does not help you, there is a delicate type of tweezers that moves the needle first. They have long tines and a short handle, thick so they do not bend when you hold them on the needle. And this is the form of the large forceps.
They should be as you see, thick in the handles until even if you hold them on it they do not bend themselves and are short tined. They should be made of Indian iron or hardened steel with precisely processed ends and at its tip needles that fit into each other allowing a tight and firm grasp.
And the tips can be made like that of an applicator, also being strong in control.
The third and thirty chapter.
In removing the roots of the teeth and extracting broken jaw bones.
If the root of the tooth is broken when removing it, you should place cotton soaked in beeswax for one or two days on the spot so that the area can rest. Then you insert the forceps or tweezers inside. Which somewhat resemble the beak of a bird called blarg, and this is how the forceps look:
It should be made like an applicator from the inside or like a scalpel. If you find it necessary to exit in this way of forceps, you must scrape along the root and expose all flesh with the scalpel first. Then you insert the tool that resembles a small hook, here is its image:
Short extremity is somewhat thick at the base and is not smooth lest it breaks if pulled out straight. Otherwise, use this other device shown here, the first with a triangular tip that has some thickness at its end.
A gentle triangular picture:.
We also rely on this device with two handles, as shown here:.
And with other devices and hammers that are mentioned in the inventory of surgical tools, we also use this large anvil-like device as shown here:.
A triangular tip with some slight thickness to prevent it from breaking, and is not smooth. Know that surgical tools are numerous as are all other tools, they are almost impossible to count. The craftsman who makes the surgical path will invent new tools for himself based on what his work and diseases themselves suggest.
Because there are diseases that have not been mentioned in their earliest descriptions, with changes in their types, if the jaw bone or any other bones of the mouth break or get infected, then you should inspect it at its location using any suitable device from among these tools and calipers I mentioned when pulling out the roots.
And we rely on this pair, as depicted:
It will have some slight thickness to control the bone so it doesn't escape until the bone is pulled out, and we apply medications suitable for this. If the bone has an infection or darkness then remove it from its infection and blackness until it becomes clean, then treat it until it heals.
The Second and Thirty Chapters.
In spreading the germinating roots on others.
If hair grows out of its natural groove, it is considered ugly in appearance. This becomes particularly noticeable if this happens to women and slaves. If you observe closely, then should the hair have sprouted from behind another hair.
If it cannot be spread or pulled out, he should pull it with this instrument shown here, even if it is stuck to another hair.
She is similar to a small beak, made of very sharp Indian iron. Your cuts with it will be many due to the hardness of hair and to avoid disturbing other hairs. If it is stuck in such a way that it can be pulled out, then pull it with an Indian hair remover which appearance is like this.
Everything is from India, and its engraving is very fine, like the razor you make with needles. It slowly cools the hair for several days gently so as not to disturb the hair and then pulls it again and removes it with some small pieces of skin.
If some of the hair has broken off, it can hurt the tongue when speaking. Therefore, you should cool it down until that rough break goes away and feels smooth without hurting the tongue or disturbing speech.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In braiding movable hairs with threads of silver or threads of gold.
If shown to the old hairs, they become unstable and move due to a hit or fall. The animal can't bite anything for fear of dropping it. Treatment with concentrated remedies did not help the cure.
The trick is to pull with a thread of gold or silver. Gold is better because silver corrodes and decomposes after days while gold stays the same forever, not subjecting it to that. The thread should be moderate in softness and hardness according to what can fit between the hairs.
The image of the intertwining is as follows: take the thread and insert its bend between the two correct thumbs, then weave the ends of the thread between one or more movable thumbs until the weaving reaches the correct thumb from the other side.
Then weave back to the side it started from and gently pull your hand with wisdom so that the tip does not move, and your tension is on the ends of the thread at the base of the fingers in order for them not to slip. Then cut the excess end of the thread with scissors and gather them together, tie them with a knot, and hide them between the correct finger and the movable one.
So as not to cause the tongue to swell, leave it like this tied up. If it dissolves or breaks, tighten it with another thread so you can enjoy it like this for all time. This is an image of the fingers and the method of intertwining in two correct thumbs and two movable ones as seen:
The finger might twist back one or both after falling in its place and intertwining as we described, and it remains. It is done by the craftsman who rides with a companion. They carve bone from cattle bones to make it resemble a finger and place it in the spot where the finger had been. It is tied as we said, remaining and being enjoyed like that.
Chapter 34.
In cutting the band that is placed under the tongue, it prevents speaking.
This band that is placed under the tongue may either be naturally occurring in humans, born with it, or be accidental, resulting from a healed wound.
The procedure involves opening the mouth of the patient and his head on your lap, lifting his tongue, then cutting this nervous band across until the tongue is released from holding it. If there is some hardness or complexity in it, which resulted from a healed wound, place a tool and cut it across until the band detaches and the knot dissolves.
Warn that the incision should not be too deep in the depth of the flesh, for it might cut a vessel there causing bleeding. Then wash the aftermath of the cut with rose water or vinegar and cold water, then place under the tongue a thread of cotton that is held by the slave each night.
To prevent it from healing again in case of bleeding, apply a powder that sticks on the spot. If your blood dominates, wet the area with an opthalmic applicator suitable for this purpose. Then treat him with all forms of treatment until he recovers.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In removing the toad that has grown under the tongue.
It may happen that a tumor resembling a small toad occurs under the tongue, preventing it from performing its natural functions and possibly causing bone growth until it fills the mouth. The treatment involves opening the slave's mouth towards the sun and looking at the lump.
If you see it colored like wax or black and hard, without the slave feeling any sensation from it, do not expose him to it, for he might be suffering from cancer. If it leans towards whiteness with moisture, apply saffron in it, cut it with a gentle scalpel, and remove it from all sides.
If your blood dominates while you are working, apply a powder on it until the bleeding stops. Then return to your work until you can remove it completely, then wash with vinegar and salt.
Then treat him with all appropriate remedies until he recovers.
The thirty-sixth chapter.
In the treatment of breast tumors.
What grows in the neck from other masses may contain glands that resemble those which appear externally, called tonsils. If treated with what was mentioned in the section, they do not heal.
Look, if the tumor is hard like a red line with little sensation, do not expose it to iron. If it is red in color and firm at its base, do not expose it to iron either for fear of bleeding. Instead, leave it alone until it ripens; either it will heal or burst from itself.
If it is white in color and long, with a soft base - this is the one that should be cut. In working on it, you should look before you act to see if the heat has completely settled in the sore area or if there's still some residual heat.
In that case, you would have the patient sit facing the sun with their head on a stone while opening their mouth. You would then take control of them in your hands and guide their tongue down using an instrument like this one:.
It is made from silver or copper, being thin like a knife. If you guide it into the tongue and see where the tumor is and what part of it falls under your gaze, take a small metal plate and pierce it through the tonsil and pull it out as much as possible without pulling out any of the surrounding tissue.
Then you cut it using an instrument like this, resembling scissors but with each of its two ends curved as if they were shoes for the other, both very sharp. You make it out of Indian iron or Damascus steel:.
If you don't have this instrument, cut it using this one instead:.
One end is sharp and the other is not. After cutting one tonsil, you cut the other in the same manner. Then, after cutting, irrigate the patient with cold water or saline solution.
If blood loss occurs, then they should be treated with water that has been boiled and added with the peels of balsam or asphodel leaves or similar substances until the bleeding stops. Then it should be treated until recovery occurs. And there might be other swellings besides the two glands in the neck which need to be cut out in the same way as cutting the two glands.
And a woman was treated whose tumor had grown inside her throat, reaching the hyoid bone. It almost blocked her throat and she was breathing through a narrow passage, which prevented her from eating or drinking water.
And she was at the brink of death if she had survived for a day or two. The tumor had grown and produced branches until they reached her nostrils, so I took action immediately; I pierced one of them with an awl and pulled it out by its root.
Then I cut it where she had pierced her nose. She then did the same with the other protrusion from the nasal cavity. After that, she opened her mouth and squeezed her tongue, and then I inserted the awl into the tumor itself. Then, I removed some of it; only a slight bleeding occurred.
The woman's throat began to heal, and she was able to drink water shortly afterwards. She was then able to eat food again. We continued cutting that tumor repeatedly for a long time; the tumor would regenerate in place of what we cut until it took a lot of time, both for me and her.
The tumor changed and decreased inside her throat. It stopped growing, then I moved away from the scene and did not know what God had done to me afterwards.
Chapter thirty-four.
In the section about cutting out tumors of the larynx.
The one who is called angraba when a passage descends to the uterus and swells, being white and rectangular. If it's hard at the bottom and oblong, then it's also referred to as angraba. If treated with what we mentioned in the division of treatment, yet the treatment doesn't work.
I saw the hot tumor having settled, and it was delicate. It should be cut but there wasn't a united lump of it that was cylindrical, nor did it have length, and it was red or similar in color to blood, or dark, or without sensation. One should avoid cutting it.
In it, there is a difficulty for the ill-fated one; if seen as described by its whiteness and length, the ill-fated one should stay in sunlight wearing sandals and use the tool provided to pinch his tongue. Then the pricking needle should be inserted into the angraba.
And draw it down, and cut it with one of the two tools that I mentioned for cutting the two nuts. You should only cut from it whatever has exceeded what is natural without any excess; because if you cut more than necessary, you will harm speech and conversation.
Then, after cutting it, apply the method we described for cutting the two nuts until recovery. If the ill-fated one refrains from cutting, they should employ the trick in rubbing their neck without fear or caution and its purpose is with a strong medicine; that is to place the head of the ill-fated one on your stone.
Then pinch his tongue with the tool we mentioned. Take the hot water that was described in the section about rubbing and mix it with an unquenched grinding stone to make it neither too thick nor too thin. Fill this device with it; this is its appearance:.
The part where you place the medicine has its consistency similar to that of a spoonful of oil, you put the device with the medicine onto his chest and places the patient on their side so as to drain saliva from inside their throat in order that nothing falls into his throat which may harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine while squeezing it on the chest for half an hour until you see that it has turned black and calmed down the bite of the medicine. If you wish, take a cotton ball and twist it at the end of the applicator rod, then soak the cotton in the medicine.
The applicator rod with the cotton goes into a tube from above until the cotton sticks to the chest. Do this repeatedly until you reach your desired amount of ointment, then leave it as it will soften and shrink after three or four days. If you need to apply more medicine, do so again.
After applying the ointment, wipe around the wound with cotton that has been soaked in oil and remove any remaining medicine. Then rinse with cold water, treat from outside with bandages and inside with gauze until healed. This type of treatment is safer than surgery and avoids fear.
The chest can also be treated with something gentler than ligation and cutting. Treat it with incense on this condition, take fat, vinegar, fennel, wormwood, cinnamon, cardamom and similar plants from the herbs. Gather all or some of them in a pot and soak it in vinegar.
Stir and let the pot heat evenly on the wisdom of the stove. In the center of the lid, make a hole to place the evaporating device made from silver or copper like this:
The intervention in the site of the tumor enters the recipient until it reaches the mouth of the tube, so that the steam rises to the heat source through the pipe until the heat source strengthens very much then applies this treatment several times till it softens. Do not apply this treatment at the first occurrence of the lump.
If it often increases in the lump, then you should do this when her hot lump decreases. If this machine doesn't stop it, take a tube and fit an eggshell at its end so that it doesn't burn the mouth of the patient.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment with its safety.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In removing splinters and what erupts in the throat other than that.
Often, bones or thin splinters or other things may erupt in the throat. It is necessary to remove what was visible and fell into one's sight after pressing the tongue with the machine under sunlight.
To help you see what is in the throat, and what did not appear to you and hid in the throat, it should be given to the patient to vomit before his food digests in his stomach. Perhaps the erupted thing will come out with vomiting or might swallow a piece of food that stuck or swallowed some residue.
Or he might swallow a piece of dry bread, or she takes a small piece of the soft sea sponge, ties it in a string then swallows it. If it reaches the place where the splinter is, quickly pull the string and do this several times.
Often, the splinter or bone sticks in it and is removed. If it does not come out as we have mentioned, otherwise use an iron machine like this:.
Be slightly longer than the incision and at its end there is a stopper that the pus enters through it gently while he raises his head upwards, being cautious not to touch his throat for fear of causing him to cough or dislodge the bone or the splint, or has the doctor enter it with his hand.
And guiding the stopper in it is better for him to know the location of the emerging thing and either pushes it down or pulls his hand up by the apparatus; all of this according to what has prepared him until it exits.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the removal of the pus in the throat.
If the treatment with what we have mentioned in this chapter, which is the treatment with medicines, does not work, then look at the sunken area in the throat of the patient after pressing his tongue with the instrument you were shown.
If you see the ulna, then attract it with a small pin or a soft and firm goad. If you are unable to do so, otherwise take a bent tube and insert it into the throat of the ulna until close to the ulna, then insert a red-hot rod into the hollow of the tube.
This is done repeatedly, and the ulna bears his thirst all day. Then he takes a glass filled with cold water and opens his mouth for it and rinses with it, without swallowing even a drop, stirring the water back and forth in his mouth with his hand from time to time.
If the ulna feels the water, it drops into place. If it doesn't come out as described, you need to perform the procedure for emptying the throat with urine and with a device that was described in incense of Allah. Do this multiple times; then it will drop.
The purpose of using the brazier is to take a quantity containing fevered coals in it. The brazier is covered with a lid, and there is a hole in its center. Then an instrument part is assembled inside this hole. Afterward, incense is placed into one end of the tube, and the patient's mouth is held at the other end, sealed to prevent any incense from escaping until he realizes that the incense has reached his throat.
If the morsel falls onto the place, if it does not fall or if it is repeated with incense repeatedly, and the patient endures thirst, eats salt and garlic but does not drink water. Surely, this method will be necessary. And this is a picture of an instrument that attracts the morsel from the throat when it comes into contact with the sight.
It resembles the fallopians as you see, except for this speculum that enters the throat and its ends resemble the bird's beak in it. If it pokes something, it does not leave it:.
Another instrument, used to push the tongue is a wide ring made of iron that accommodates the mouth up to the tip of the tongue. It enters the mouth standing on one side, so the mouth remains open against the patient's will and it cannot be easily removed until she removes it.
The description of the instrument used to open the mouth on this specific measurement.
Chapter Forty.
In it, he makes use of speech in the throbbing of veins and splitting them.
Veins have many types, diversified according to what will be mentioned one by one in this book. They differ in their throbbing and splitting in two aspects: the first is of the type of the vein itself and what it contains from fluids.
The second type of division based on the locations they occur within the body, because a tumor occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the abdomen, and a tumor occurring in a muscular area is different from one occurring in a joint. Each of them has its own rule concerning treatment.
And among tumors, there is what should not be extracted until the pus has ripened and reached its completeness. And there is that which should be extracted even before it fully ripens, such as tumors that are close to joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and takes time to develop until it starts discharging pus around it, it might damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint. This could result in the malfunctioning of that part or makes the tumor close to an important body part.
Because if you delay the extraction until it fully ripens, you damage the main body part or it becomes close to the abdomen in which case you should extract it as intended. It should be noted that what needs to be extracted is one that hasn't fully ripened but is near the abdomen to avoid pus spreading into the abdomen and becoming invasive.
There is also what becomes in a way that does not heal, and you should know when to extract tumors that have fully ripened. This occurs when the pain subsides, fever disappears, redness diminishes, it stops throbbing, and the head of the tumor and all other signs disappear.
It is necessary to perform the extraction from below the location of the tumor if possible, as this makes it easier for pus to flow downwards or towards the deepest part of the tumor and with more strength. The incision should be made along the body's length if tumors are located near the limbs.
Locations of muscles, tendons, nerves, arteries, and in general all level places without curvature. As for those that are curved, it is better to go with the cut according to that position. If the tumor is in muscular areas, leaving a small opening is preferable.
Until its pus coagulates as we described on the completion, if you squeezed it before then there would be an extended leakage of pus from it and it would be excessively dirty. It may also have hardened its lips and face, and some swellings might remain in the body's surface when necessary or according to what the organ needs.
It is necessary to use one squeeze for small swellings and a wide or many incisions for large ones, depending on the size of the tumor. There are also some swellings that need the skin to be scraped and cut if they have become like scratches.
It has become in some cases, as it is displayed in many pus-filled areas and hiding places. Among them are those that split into three angular slits, and among them are those that cut like aces' card form, such as the tumor of arthritis.
Some of them make use of the circular cut and the crescent-shaped cut, and similar cuts. And if they don't have a head like the flattened spreading tumors, it is sufficient to squeeze it with a simple squeeze only. And if the tumor is large and has accumulated for a long time and squeezed, it should not rush to drain all its pus at once.
But remove some of it, then tighten the tumor for another day and also drain some pus. Do this repeatedly in succession until all is removed.
Nor is it less significant if the patient has weak strength, or is pregnant, or a young child, or an elderly person. The living animal spirit often dissolves with the removal of pus in one go; perhaps the patient might die without you noticing. Be extremely careful of this aspect.
After squeezing such swellings, you should clean the wound and inspect it. If the tumor's wound is small or had a single simple incision, use cotton fiber or old cotton for cleaning. If the tumor is large, and the incisions made during squeezing were numerous.
In each cut, you must insert threads until they touch one another, even if the tumor has been removed from the skin or thinned. It is necessary to stuff it with used cotton or burlap without moisture and tighten it up to the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with what is needed of ointments until it heals. If you experience bleeding while you are working, use cold water and lemon juice after drinking a cotton swab浸 in them, and carry it over the bleeding spot multiple times.
If bleeding persists, it is necessary to use the measures and treatments as well as the remedies that we have described in various sections of this book and its chapters. If you are during winter and the location of the tumor has many nerves, it may be recommended to drink a hot beverage and apply warm oil.
And place it on the spot. If you are in summer and the locations are hot, it may be recommended to carry the remedies with a drink of water and oil or a drink and oil all of which should be cold until the third day as we said, at which point the tumor should dissolve and be wiped clean.
You should use what is suitable for its treatment until it heals. This is what you need to know about treating tumors in general, and as for detailed procedures, I have outlined each tumor and how to treat it in detail.
Chapter Fifty-Four.
In the section on tumors that appear on the scalp.
Tumors appear on the scalp, they are small and belong to a category of goods contained by follicles that have characteristics like chicken combs. They have various types; some are fatty and others contain moisture resembling pus.
It includes some that contain moisture similar to pilau or stew and the like, and others are hard stone-like. All of them do not pose any risk in their cutting and removal as long as no artery obstructs you during cutting.
And when working on cutting it, you should first pierce it with the tool that appears after this instruction and is called the scalpel to know what it contains. If it contains moisture, cut it along its length in a simple incision as depicted here:.
Begin by cutting along the line ~b~ to line ~g~. If all moisture has drained, remove the sac that contained this moisture and cut it entirely without leaving anything behind. Often, if something remains, it returns even after removing a part of it.
Then soak a cotton ball in the clarified ointment if it's available, or else in salt water. Fill the wound with this and leave it until tomorrow. It will consume whatever is left of the sac, then re-soak the wound with the same again, and maybe even a third time if needed.
Until you are sure that nothing is left of the sac, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the tumor contains fatty goods, cut it in this manner:.
Cut it like a hard stick, and place the needles in both sides of the wound. Remove it from every side with as much effort as possible to extract the pus that contains it. If an artery obstructs you during this process, follow what was described for you after this instruction; do so as well if the tumor is hardened by the cut.
The treatment is as previously mentioned, and cutting the hardened tumor is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these tumors that exist in some people's heads do not contain any moisture at all; this occurs when you cut into such a tumor.
Head of an elderly woman, I removed the tumour as hard as a chalky stone, it was white and unbreakable. No one could break it even if he threw it, this is unlike other head tumors that occur in children's heads.
And when it comes to the canals of the ears, split them all into a simple cut and make its bottom part lower so that the material flows downwards more easily. Then treat it with what suits its treatment.
Chapter forty-two.
In the cut on pigs, which are often found around the neck, these tumors also occur in the neck and under the elbows, as well as in the axillae. They can also appear in other parts of the body. Sometimes only one appears in the neck from them, but sometimes there are many, developing from each other.
Every pig of them has a special inner cavity inside her for it, just as in merchandise and head tumors as we described. There are many types of pigs, some being hard, some containing moisture, and some being poisonous not responding to treatment.
I have noticed some of them with good condition under touch, its appearance was nearly like the skin's color and it moves in every direction without being stuck to the neck nerve, ligament or artery. Also, it wasn't swollen. It is necessary to cut her with a simple incision from the top down the body like this line "~a~" to line "~b~".
You should peel it from every side, and stretch the skin flap with a saw or two saws or many if needed as we mentioned for head tumors. You need to remove it slowly, making sure not to cut sweat or nerves. The incision tool shouldn't be extremely sharp.
So that your hand does not increase in cutting or worry you unnecessarily, cut only what is necessary. If you cut a vein or artery and impede your work, place some powder or certain laceration-inducing items to stop the bleeding in the wound.
Tighten the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to heal. The blood will stop flowing at that point, then return to your work until it is completed. Then use your skilled finger to check if there's any remaining clot, followed by small tweezers. Use them to remove and clean any remaining clots.
If there is a great blood vessel in the source of the pig, it would not be necessary to cut out that part of the source. Instead, you should tie it with a thin double thread and leave it until it falls out on its own without causing harm. Then, stuff the wound with cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian balsam, and then treat it.
If you have cut the pig completely, it would be necessary to gather the edges of the wound and suture them after ensuring that there is no remaining fat. If you see that there has been a remnant of bone from the pig's flesh.
It would be necessary to mean cutting off its root and tip, using stitches, as we mentioned before. If pigs contained moisture, they should be basted lightly where you can see the place of ripening, making the basting go downwards as we said.
Then, after the basting, use the Egyptian ointment and similar for it to eat away any remaining rot. Once you see that the wound has cleaned, treat it with the plant-based ointments used on meat until it is purified.
Chapter Forty-One
In the passage of removing a tumor in the throat which occurs inside the back of the throat.
I have mentioned this passage of the throat before; I haven't seen anyone in our country do it. This is how they talk, but those who suffer from heartburn should avoid cutting the throat because it doesn't benefit them.
In order for all the lymph nodes and lungs to be moistened, while those who have a hot tumor in the mouth or throat or lymph nodes, if the cause is not within the pipe, it's necessary to use the passage of the throat to escape from the distress caused by suffocation.
If we want to do this, it is necessary to cut the throat under three or four circles of the pipe's circles, making small cuts lengthwise between two circles. The size of the cut should be according to the cut in the windpipe and not in the cartilage. This position corresponds with the cut.
Because it lacks flesh and its blood vessels are far away, if the surgeon is daring, he should extend the throat's skin with a bandage then cut the skin until he reaches the pipe next to the blood vessels; if he sees something from them.
Then he cuts the windpipe as we described, and uses the presence of mucus coming out from it along with sneezing, loss of voice, leaving the wound open for some time. If the time came when he was no longer afraid of suffocation, he unites the wound lips with skin.
His plan is without the cartilage first, then use the medications that promote wound healing until it heals. He who wrote this book explained this sentence of our narration: "When they saw that the patient's throat had been obstructed by one of these tumors.
Wael Abu Alaal on the brink of death, hastened to cut his throat so that Wael could breathe near the wound and thus survive. They were instructed not to close the wound until the course of illness was complete, which typically lasted three days or thereabouts.
When that happened, they were ordered to suture the wound and treat it until he recovered. The one I witnessed saw a servant who took a knife and went after her head with it, cutting off some of her bronchial tube; she was summoned for treatment. When we found her, she was choking as if she had been slaughtered. We opened up her wound.
I found that the blood coming out of the wound was minimal, indicating that no major veins or arteries had been severed. Air was able to escape from the wound which made her cough; she then stitched up the wound and treated it until she recovered. The servant only made a sound like someone choking, nothing more.
She recovered to her best condition after some days. Therefore, we can say that cutting the throat carries no risk.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the cutting of the tumor that appears inside the nostril and is called the nose septum.
This tumor, which is called the nose septum, is a large body of tissue matching the color of the skin. In women, it is quite common and exists in two forms.
Either it is natural or it is accidental. With the natural one, there is no remedy and with the accidental ones, there are two types: one resembles fatty lumps and the other resembles a tumor formed by knots in the veins. In cutting them, caution is needed. It is not advisable to use plain iron on it except for the smaller part; if you probe and examine it with the probe, its structure resembles that of fatty tumors. It does not adhere to anything from the tissues, so cut it like cutting into fatty masses. And remove it with what contains the sac if it's in a sac, and otherwise, thoroughly search for all of it, then treat the area with whatever is suitable for treatment.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the cut for types of fatty masses.
Fatty masses come in various types, and I have mentioned all of them in the section. It is necessary to clarify here the difference between fatty masses and pus because it's confusing. One thing I can say is that pus has heat, fever, and frightening pains until the advantage calms down. The pus completes its process, and at that point, the fever and pain subside. The fatty mass does not have heat or fever or pains with it. It contains a specific bag called its cavity, which is the same color as the body and starts like mustard and becomes like a pimple, both larger and smaller.
It is of two types, either fatty or containing moisture. Various colors of moisture have been mentioned in the section, so if you are treating a fatty mass, it's advisable to probe and examine it first with an instrument called the 'mades'. The description of this will follow this paragraph as shown in the next part.
Measure the size of the tumor, then insert the probe and observe what comes out from it. If a watery moisture comes out, regardless of its color, cut it with a simple incision as described in other tumors. If no moisture comes out from the insertion of the probe, recognize that it is fatty.
Saw a cut on it as shown in this image, as I taught you, hang it with braces and gently strip the skin from each side, and if possible retain the contents of the package when removing it properly.
If the package breaks during work and you cannot remove it properly, this often leads to complications. Remove it piece by piece until nothing is left. If there's any residue remaining, whether little or large, it may complicate matters again.
If what remains is minimal, you can do the incision after being left with a bit of tender matter. Sew up the wound and place something to cool down any hot lump above it, and treat it with other treatments until it heals. If the package is large, draw its edges and treat it in a way that promotes healing.
If you encounter a harmful or non-harmful scab that causes bleeding, act immediately by applying the powdered plaster to the area and leave it tightly in place for two or three days until the wound cleanses and the blood stops boiling. Then proceed with cutting what is left of the package.
The Sixty-Fourth Chapter.
In Illustrations of the Machines.
The ones that operate in the cut and puncture, they are illustrations of syringes and there are three types among them; large, medium, and small.
Illustration of a large syringe:
Illustration of a medium syringe:
Illustration of a small syringe:
It is made of well-fitted, square-edged iron to facilitate entry into tumors. These are the illustrations of scalpels and they are called 'the cold' [a term referring to sharp tools]. There are also three types among them; large, medium, and small. Illustration of a large scalpel:
The picture in the middle: a surgical instrument.
The picture of a small scalpel:.
It is suitable for examining tumors, surgeries, nails and cavities about what is inside them from bones and the like. A smooth turning screw is made like a chisel of Chinese or scythe copper, or of copper or iron or silver, and the best among them are those made of scythes.
Scrapers can also be made from black lead, and it is suitable to use them for nails that are in the groove with an obstruction causing smoothness on her. This obstruction has three types because of some being long, others being in the middle, and others being short.
The size of each nail groove requires, and makes its thickness according to the size and narrowness of the nails, picture of a large lead scalpel:.
Picture of a medium-sized lead scalpel:
Picture of a small lead scalpel:.
Pictures of the chisels, they are numerous types as there is one that is simple meaning having one cutting edge and it has three kinds; large, middle-sized and small. And among them are blind chisels which have three types. And among them are the chisels with two cutting edges, which also have three types. And among them are the double-edged chisels which are sharpened on their edges. And they are three types, and among them are the chisels with three cutting edges which have three types, all these forms need each of them in its place. Picture of a simple large chisel:. Picture of a simple medium chisel:. Picture of a simple small chisel:.
Large darkened picture: Middle darkened image:.
Small darkened picture:.
Large darkened sculpture with hammers: Middle-sized sculpture with hammers:. Small sculpture with hammers:.
Large sculpture with three nozzles:.
Middle-sized sculpture with three nozzles:. Small sculpture with three nozzles:.
And these are the scalpels that cut and slice goods and tumors; they come in three types - some large, some medium-sized, and some small. This is a picture of a large scalpel:.
Medium scalpel image:.
Small scalpel image:.
Her needles, with which she cuts, are limited and the rest of the ends are unlimited. It was made this way to rely on it in removing goods when fearing cutting a nerve or a nerve fiber. If one uses it slightly while slicing tumors, they may find some relief from the burning sensation they feel during tumor removal.
And these are the bladders images, they come in three types - some large, some medium-sized, and some small. This is an image of a large bladder:.
It is made of a leadish substance that twists and in one end it resembles a broad spoon made of two parts, which has a hidden cutting tool at its tip resembling a bird's tongue. It can be moved inside and outside as you wish when you desire as you see.
The images of the clamps that cover between the fingers in the case of small tumors are not felt by the patient and they come in three types according to their size. The image of a large clamp:.
The images of the clamps used to stop bleeding are three types according to their size, as follows for the large clamp:.
They are made of copper or from a wheel turned china to be slightly longer than the length as you see, and they should be thin. It is necessary for these types of clamps to have large and small ones with you so that you can quickly stop bleeding when needed, and when medicine isn't available.
However, do not use them for cutting blood in every part of the body. Rather, use them on muscular places such as thigh muscles, calf muscles, arm muscles, breast muscle, abdominal muscles and other wet muscular organs.
And you can also make other small devices from them that resemble pistachio shells as in this image:.
It is used to stop bleeding if there is bleeding from the incision site, or when cutting blood vessels or arteries. It can also be made into a tool like this image:.
The seventy-fourth section.
In the nipple of male breasts.
The one that resembles female breasts, some people's nipples may swell to resemble female breasts and become reddish-black. If one dislikes this appearance, it is recommended to make a cut on the nipple in the shape of a crescent, as shown here.
From line ~b~ to line ~g~:. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with putty ointment, and stitch together the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals. If milk flows down to the bottom due to its strength, like it does for women.
You should cut in its upper sides with two cuts resembling a crescent shape, each one connecting to the other at their ends so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one in this form:. From line ~b~ to line ~g~, then remove the skin that is in between the two cuts, and take out all the fat. Use the stitches and sutures we have mentioned along with anything else required for treatment until it heals.
If a piece is too large for you to handle due to concern or bleeding, it should be gauze soaked in kaolin ointment that fills the wound. Leave it until what's left of the fat gets consumed, then treat it until it heals.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the case of tumors that appear below the elbow.
These tumors that appear below the elbow are of pig type, containing a sack. From among them, some contain moisture. Whatever contains moisture should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~g~, then remove all contents of the tumor with a dry gauze and leave it until another day, then remove the gauze.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals, if the tumor is of pig knot type, cut it as we mentioned for the pig's incision. If the wound extends to produce pus, then use the method we described previously when dealing with pus.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the cavity of the tumor that is presented in front of the artery or vein, which is called aneurysm.
If the artery is wounded and the skin above it adheres, it often exposes a tumor. Similarly, a vein may also expose a tumor due to swelling within it.
The symptoms by which one can identify whether the tumor or swelling is caused by an artery or a vein. If the tumor is due to an artery, it will be rectangular and gathered deep within the body. And when you press the tumor with your finger, you feel that there's a hollow in it.
The one that is due to a vein will have the tumor lying superficially in the body, and the cavity on these tumors is dangerous especially in places like the elbows, armpits, necks, and many other parts of the body. These tumors were extremely large and it was advisable to avoid treating them with iron.
Also, anything that occurs in the limbs or head should be avoided. If it is an enlargement of the artery cavity, then make a cut on the skin along its length. Then open this cut with slits and finally incise the artery and remove any clots from it.
Until it is revealed, then insert a needle and pass it to the other side, and tighten the artery with a twined thread in two points as you have found out about the arteries which are on the neck. Then close this position by clamping between the straps until all the blood inside comes out.
The tumor then dissolves, and the treatment that produces pus is used until the straps fall. Then it should be treated with ointments suitable for this until it heals.
If the tumor is before a vein cut, it should be necessary to hold what you can of the tumor with the skin by your hand then insert a needle below the position that you held by your hand and carry it through with a double thread until it comes out from the other side. Then, tie the tumor firmly as you were told to tie the bunch of grapes from both sides with each end of the thread. If I fear that the threads might come undone, insert another needle with another thread underneath the entire tumor at the crossing point of the first needle.
Pull the threads in four places. Then cut open the tumor in its middle until what is inside comes out, then remove any excess skin and leave what was tied up from it. Afterwards, place on it a dressing that you have soaked with wine and oil. Then use the treatment consisting of ointments and creams until it heals.
The fiftieth chapter.
In the tumor that appears due to nerve inflammation.
Likewise, the tumor occurs in veins and arteries, also the tumor appears in nerves if there is a blow or excessive fatigue or something similar to it happens, and this is more common in places of thickened nerves and joints.
In every place where joints move, this is a soft tumor that resembles the color of the rest of the body and is usually without pain. If you press it hard, you would feel a sensation similar to numbness in the patient. The tumor does not remain deeply within the body.
But it lies under the skin and moves to every direction, neither forwards nor backwards. If there is any in the joints, it should not be exposed to iron as it might cause problems. And if it's in the head or forehead.
If you divide the skin with multiple cuts, if the tumor is small, hold it with a rasp and cut it from its source. If it's large, attach it with a thread and remove it, then remove it and sew up the wound with stitches until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-One.
In cutting the hernias that occur in the abdomen.
Many people have experienced hernias in their bellies and other parts of their bodies. These are called fungal hernias because they resemble fungi; their origin is thin while their head is firm, often it changes the texture of their edges and can vary from small to very large.
I have seen a man with hernias in his belly, resembling mushrooms; they were thin white at their origin and had changed texture, cracking on their edges. The moisture constantly flowed from them. I cut both of them out, the weight of one was around 12 ounces while the other was about 6 ounces.
The procedure for removing them is to examine them. If the hernia is damp, and the color of the hernia when it's wet is a pale white with a thin origin, cut them with broad incisions using a hot copper tool. Often, when cutting them, much blood will rush out.
If you find that the blood is too much, stop it by pressing. If I see the hernia to be tough and scared of being cut with iron tools, take a strong thread made of lead and tie the hernia according to its characteristic. Leave it for two days, then add more tension on the lead; the lead will continue to do so.
You should keep on exerting the hernia until it breaks off without any difficulty. If the hernia has a firm origin, then you will have some fear and hesitation in cutting it, especially if it's located in the abdomen. However, it may be possible to cut half of it or part of it.
Then reinforcement so that it does not recur, then treat him until the wound heals, and beware of exposing him to a scar that is like a line with little sensation and appears prominent. This is a sign of cancer, and I will mention cancer after this.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
In treating intercostal pain.
Intercostal pain is caused by many factors, either from the rupture of the abdominal duct which produces pus or undigested food as mentioned in other cases, or from bleeding from a vein or artery as previously stated, or it could be due to wind getting stuck inside.
If it is due to the rupture of the abdominal duct and the discharge of pus, then the color of the tumor resembles the body's color, it has a yellowish appearance without pain, and appears different in position. And if it is due to the discharge of undigested food, its position differs from what we have described. If you pinch it with your fingers, it disappears then returns; and perhaps there might be a hard lump that enlarges significantly when going to the bathroom or experiencing extreme tiredness. If it's due to dampness, then it would have a yellowish color.
It doesn't disappear if you pinch it with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease in size. If it's due to blood, then along with these signs, the tumor appears black. If it's due to new flesh, then the tumor is hard and solid, staying at a certain point.
If it is due to wind, then touching it will have a yellowish appearance. In dealing with this, you should observe: if intercostal pain results from blood in the artery or vein or wind, it would be wise not to treat it as there's fear and deception involved, similar to what I taught you regarding tumors that occur due to the artery and vein, in the chapter on tumors originating from them.
If the wound in the scrotum is from before the belly or the boil, it is necessary to command the patient to hold himself and stand upright then teach him with the needle around the whole wound. Then command him to lie between your hands on his back. Then, using a broad scalpel, incise in the area you taught with the needle on the position of the lump. Extend the middle part of the tumor upwards with a large thread. Then, bind the site of the incision tightly with strong cotton or silk thread.
The knot of the band should be loose initially. Then, open in the center of the compressed tumor above the band and enter your index finger. If you find pus inside, make it pass through the band and push it back into the abdomen. If a boil is found, extend it with a thread.
Cut off the excess. If a vein or artery obstructs you, band them tightly and return to your work. Take two needles and insert two strong threads into them. Enter the ends of these needles inside the incision made around the tumor. Then pull the tumor in four places with the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the position until the flesh compressed recedes on itself or falls off. If it thickens and turns green, cut it then. Afterwards, treat it with what is necessary of ointments until it heals, especially if the wound in the scrotum was due to freshly formed tissue there.
Or if it's due to moisture, as we said, you should incise the lump and remove the blood or moisture that is in there. Then treat it with what will heal the area.
The fifty-second chapter.
In treating cancer.
We mentioned in this section the types of cancer and how it is treated with medication, warning against using iron treatment for fear of causing erosion. We also mentioned cancer originating from the womb and warned against its treatment.
And it was mentioned that if the cancer is in a location where it can be completely removed, such as breast or thigh cancers and others which are capable of being removed all at once, especially if it's small and new. However, if it presents as large, there should not be an attempt to reach it.
If I had been able to heal anyone from this disease or seen someone before me reach this point, the work would have progressed as we said, making it easier on the second black day, then further dividing if it is filled with a clear substance within the veins.
Then, the ulcer is positioned in such a way that it can benefit from work. Then, tubes are implanted into the cancer that are suitable for it. It is then hollowed out from every side along with the skin until nothing remains of its origin and blood flows without stopping. It does not cut it quickly.
But squeeze the places, drain all the thick blood with your hands or by means of machines available to you. If work obstructs you, there will be a great bleeding from cutting an artery or vein; open the veins until the blood stops then treat him with all other treatments until he heals.
The forty-fifth chapter.
In treating leprosy.
We have been informed in this section about the types of leprosy, how to meet water and signs of each type, and its treatment with medicine. The one treated with iron is solely the leprosy that excretes pus, but not with iron is it treated either of the gray or flesh types.
If this kind of testicle swelling has been treated with medicines and your treatment did not work, look to see if the patient has overdone his weakness or if he has another disease besides the swelling such as having one.
If there is coughing or diarrhea, and so forth, then you should treat him with iron as it can be dangerous. If I see the patient strong in strength without having any other disease except the swelling itself, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the approach in dealing with him should be to have him stand between your hands. And serve him behind, pressing his belly with your hands and forcing the water downwards towards the elbow area. Then take a curved tool like this:.
Limited between the two sides for a long time, defined at the tip like the tool, except that it has some fuzziness slightly to prevent it from being used in surgery which might harm the intestines. Then withdraw and look if the testicle originated from the intestinal area.
You should remove the cut from her pubic area down three fingers below to the elbow, if the testicle was produced due to liver disease, then let your cut be from the pubic area three fingers wide. If it was due to gallbladder disease, let your cut be on the right side up to three fingers wide.
Nor should the cut be on the side that the patient wants to lie on, lest urine flows to this weak area. Then puncture the skin with the instrument all over, then insert the instrument in this cut and lift your hand.
Between the skin and the scrotum with the curved tool like you are peeling it, so that the amount you peel is as large as a fingernail or somewhat larger. Then puncture the scrotum until the curved tool reaches an empty place which is where the water resides, then extract it and insert into this hole the instrument as shown here.
It is a semi-tubular passage made from thin metal, be it silver or copper or smooth brass, that has a small hole carved at its bottom and two holes on each side, one on each side as you can see.
And it may place its end in the shape of a quill like that of a pen, as shown in this figure:.
If it has a loop at the top, when the machine reaches the water, it descends from its reservoir onto the machine. It then expels an amount of water in medium time because if you withdraw more than necessary during this period, it might cause death to the patient due to the breakdown of his animal soul.
Or it might expose him to a near death, but let out from it according to its strength and what the patient's condition suggests in terms of his pulse power and good complexion. Then, remove the machine and let out water because that lets out from its reservoir.
Because of the skin that clings to the hole on the scrotum, as I instructed you to apply this method there. Then, repeat the operation another day if I find the patient capable of enduring it.
Also, let out a small amount of water for this procedure. You should do it daily while you are in control to avoid mistakes until only a little water remains. If you fear for the patient and leave behind some significant amount of water, bury it in hot sand as a precaution.
Excessive sweating in the sauna and under the sun, letting it endure thirst, treating with dried medicines until recovery. It should be followed by care for the stomach, liver, and gallbladder after water expulsion as described earlier.
Chapter Fifty-One.
In the treatment of newborn children whose birthplaces are not in their proper place or where the opening is narrow or not in its place.
Some boys may be born without being through their mother's abdomen and vulva; it should be done to make a hole for him as soon as he is born.
Using an extremely fine scalpel on this image:.
Then, insert a very fine lead pin into the hole and bind it, holding it for three or four days. When the child urinates towards it, push it back by the ball, then return it. If the lead is lost, then perhaps urine that was going to take its place may not leave it, causing it to close.
And as for those whose hole is narrow, treat them with lead as we mentioned, for many days until it widens. And there are among them those whose hole is not in its place; this is because some of them are born and their opening is at the end of the penis, so they cannot urinate forward.
Until he raises the scrotum with his hand and is not born before his time when menstruation cannot reach the womb on straightness, which is a very bad reason, and the purpose of this is that the expectant should lie on his back.
Then extend her vulva with your left hand strongly and shave the head of the scrotum with a razor or a sharp scalpel as big as a pen, or like you are carving something to have its center emerging resembling the penis, so that the hole should occur in the middle as it should.
And observe during your work to prevent excessive bleeding, for this often exposes you to dealing with it by stopping the blood and treating the wound until it heals.
The sixtieth chapter.
In the urine that appears in the glabella, the forehead, the back, and decay and adhesion of the glabella to the skull.
This urine often appears in the inguinal area, which is a sign of an ear infection. It can be foul-smelling or not. The non-foul smelling one should be hung by a gentle string.
And cut it until you clean the entire area, then apply a cotton ball that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then, after that, treat it with almond butter until it heals. And if the urine is foul-smelling and has a yellow color, you should use the ash after cutting and cleaning it.
If the urine is in an oily glabella and it does not mix, and some of the urine is inside the glabella while some is outside, it should be removed first from the part that's inside until it disappears. Then only after that, treat from the outside.
Because if you treat them both at the same time, the glabella may not rupture. It might also appear in women and glabella with blackness and decay. It should be scraped off anything that has turned black or is likely to spoil or already has spoiled.
Then apply the paste on it, followed by honey with pomegranate rind juice and carshin (a type of herb). Then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If there is a menstrual flow, use ash with a curved tool in this form:.
Ash is beneficial for both conditions: menstrual bleeding and wounds that have gone bad. If the forehead (kamera) gathers and disappears at some point, it should be piped through a lead pipe that goes into the urinary tract to wash it out. And if there's adhesion between the glabella (ghuffala) and the forehead (kamera),
This attachment occurs in those whose scrotum is healthy and has not been castrated, and it may be exposed to tearing due to a cut or tumor. It should be removed with an extremely sharp scalpel until the ligament dissolves and the testicle can be separated from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them through examination, it may be necessary to remove a bit from the testicle and the scrotum. The reason is that the scrotum is thin, possibly rupturing quickly due to its delicacy, then separate between the scrotum and the testicle with a fine piece of cotton thread that has been soaked in cold water so as not to stick together either.
Then it is treated with a griping drink until it heals.
The fifty-first chapter.
In purifying infants and treating what they might commit of error.
Castration is nothing other than the separation of connection like all surgeries, but as it's done by our will and used specifically on infants, we should draw out the best action in this practice.
And the easiest path leading to safety, I say that none of her works mentioned castration for anything in her writings because it was not practiced in their regulations and rather, it is what we have acquired.
By experimentation, and I found that the majority of surgeons and circumcisers use Moses' purification with scissors, and they also use tweezers and ligatures with thread, as well as bone knives for cutting. I have tried all these methods.
And I did not find anything better than purification with scissors and ligature with thread, because Moses' purification often causes the skin to stick due to the thickness of the scrotum's skin which might cut the top layer while leaving the bottom one behind.
He may be compelled to perform another amputation, pain recurs, and cleaning with the scapula doesn't go well with it because he might enter into her hole, while as for cleaning with the ulna, it may cause skin slippage and corrupt your work or the child's skin was naturally short...
Often they are born like this and do not need cleaning, and I have seen that, as for cleaning with the scissors and bandaging with thread, experience showed me its advantage because the scissors is compatible with cutting so that the blade above is similar to the blade below.
When you have adjusted your hand with the compatibility of both blades, cut according to one standard and in one time period, then the thread handling becomes nearly a wall for the skin's edge from every aspect, so there is no mistake whatsoever, and the first purpose of this operation is that it may deceive the child.
And especially if there are some who understand a little that you only tie the thread in his penis and leave him until another day, then make him happy and pleased with every way possible for him, and what he accepts with his mind, and then stop him standing before you, tall in stature.
And don't let him sit and hide the scissors in your thigh or under your foot, so that there is nothing to see by the child on it or anything from the machines, then you enter your hand into his penis and inflate the skin until the head of the penis comes out.
Then clean what gathers there of dirt, then tie the taught place with a double thread, then a little below it bind secondly with another band. Then hold with your thumb and the implement for holding beneath the lower bind well, and cut between the two bands. Then lift the skin quickly upwards and remove the head of the penis, then let a little blood flow out for it is better and causes less swelling of the penis. Then wipe it with a wet cloth afterwards sprinkle it with dry burned cinder from the brazier or use cornstarch; this is also preferable.
Then lift the skin quickly upwards and remove the head of the penis, then let a little blood flow out for it is better and causes less swelling of the penis. Then wipe it with a wet cloth afterwards sprinkle it with dry burned cinder from the brazier or use cornstarch; this is also preferable. Then apply the medicine on top using a tampon of hard-boiled egg yolk mixed with rose water and covered in a sweet-smelling oil. Leave it on him for another day, then treat him with other remedies until he recovers.
And this is the image of the scissor that is suitable for purification:.
The fettle should be straight, without any bend or kink in it, with a smooth tip and the length of the two blades equal to that of the handles. As for the error made during purification, it might involve cutting all or part of the inner skin completely when you cut; before the area swells up, it would be better if you stretched the skin using your thumbs while cutting.
Cut it evenly, if you can't hold it with your thumbnail, use a comb to pull and cut it. If three days have passed since then and the part underneath the penis head is swollen, leave it alone until the hot lump subsides and then gently scrape off.
Cut it according to what suits you, and preserve the head of the penis. If you cut a bit from the head of the penis, that won't harm, treat it with anything that heals wounds as we described in the article on tampons.
And if you cut more of the skin than necessary and it retracts upwards, that won't cause harm either. It's beneficial to use what we have mentioned until he recovers.
The 50th and eighth chapter.
In treating bladder retention of urine.
Bladder retention of urine occurs due to blockage by stones, clot blood, mucus or absorbing flesh and so forth. If this condition is treated with the methods we mentioned, which are described in this section under the treatment methods, then it will be cured.
And if urine does not begin to flow, and I've noticed that bladder retention due to a stone has affected the neck of the bladder, it should be made to sit on its knees. Then, someone needs to ride on his back and spread their belly towards his back while holding onto him as much as possible.
In that case, the neck of the bladder is forced to push the stone behind, causing urine to flow. If it doesn't flow as we mentioned and the condition worsens for the patient, it may be necessary to use a device called catheters, which has this description:.
It is made of silver and should be thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's feather quill, with the length resembling about a yard and a half. It has a gentle tip at its head, and there is a suction mechanism on it that you take a looped thread and tie a piece of wool or cotton tightly to its end.
And the thread's end enters at the bottom of the catheter and leans with support if you want to add a little wool so it can enter the tube and block it like a button, then grease the catheter with oil or butter or egg white. Then the patient sits on a chair.
And she takes her leg and anal region with moist palms, oil, or damp water, then enters the catheter into the anus gently until it reaches the root of the anal canal. Then bends the anal canal upwards towards the perineum area, then pushes the catheters inside him/her.
Even if the calculi are doubled, then the catheters are pushed inside until they approach closely to the bladder; the male gets inclined downwards and the catheters are within him. Then he is pushed until he reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that something has reached an empty thing.
And it is done at this level because the passage through which urine flows in it is bent, then by pulling the thread slightly with wool, the urine follows the wool, then she pulls it out and washes the urine, then repeating the catheters.
And you continue to do this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
The fifty-fifth chapter.
How to inject the bladder with the syringe.
And the machines suitable for this are made of silver or wrought copper, having a long tube on an iron rod. I intend to spray water and medicines in it; this is what it's called - the syringe - and here is its depiction:.
They are made of silver or wrought copper, having a long tube on an iron rod that is all worked except for the tip which has three holes: two on one side and one on the other as you see.
The hollow place where the nozzle is made to fill up to the extent that it does not exceed until if you draw something from the moisture, it will be drawn and if you push it out, it will go forward according to what is done with the pump that throws oil in sea battles.
And if you want to inject moisture into the bladder, you insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and pull it up with the nozzle. The moisture is drawn into the hollow of the syringe, then its end enters the calculus as we described in the catheters, and then you push the moisture with the nozzle.
If this moisture reaches the bladder at its position until the patient feels it, and this is an illustration of a gentle irrigator that uses it to irrigate the bladder.
It is made of silver or copper, the top part resembles a small tampon and below it is a notch where the ligament is placed. Then take a camel's bladder and place in it the moisture you want to irrigate the bladder with, then tie it between the two halves tightly with a doubled thread.
That moisture is slightly heated on the fire, then one end of the irrigator is inserted into the urethra. Then you pull your hand firmly on the bladder with the wetness tightly so that the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a thin piece of leather and make a circle out of it. Punch holes all around it, then insert a thin thread into these holes as you would twist them. Then gather the circle like a pot after placing in it whatever moisture, salts, water or other substances you wish.
Then tie it in the apparatus and make it as you made with the bladder from the twist of your hand so that the moisture reaches the bladder.
The sixty-first section.
In the removal of stones.
We have mentioned in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, we explained the difference between stones formed in the kidney and those formed in the bladder along with all its signs, and I also mentioned the stone where work is done by hand and the crack.
And this is the stone formed particularly in the bladder, which erupts in the urethra. I will describe that with a clear and concise explanation.
I say that calculi formed in the bladder are most common among boys and one of their signs is that urine coming out from the bladder resembles water when it boils.
Sand appears in it, it affects the sperm, and plays with it. It often hangs down then spreads out, causing the scrotum to protrude in many cases, making it easy for boys until they reach fourteen years old and harder in older people. As for teenagers, they are between these two groups.
The one with larger stones has an easier treatment, while the smaller ones oppose this. When it comes to treatment, it is advisable first to flush out the urine with a catheter that expels all waste in his body because he might prevent the presence of stone during examination.
Then, the urine is drained with his legs lifted and moved downwards, causing the stone to descend into the bladder neck or be pushed from a higher position several times. Then, he is held between your hands upright with his hands under his buttocks so that the bladder becomes completely tilted downwards, then it's examined.
Examine him externally, and if you feel the stone in the space, proceed immediately with drilling it with your tool. If it doesn't fall under light pressure, it might be advisable to rub the working finger of the right hand with oil if the urine is from a boy or the middle finger if it's from an adult.
If it's a complete boy, he enters it into his scrotum and searches for the stone until it falls under your finger. Then, you move it little by little to the bladder neck, then you press it with your finger and push it out towards the place where you want to drill.
You instruct a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand and you instruct another servant that if it's a woman, to lift her right hand upwards using his right hand, and using the other hand he lifts the skin underneath the woman's hands towards the place where the opening should be. Then, you take the clamp, which looks like this:.
This passage describes the process of removing stones (likely kidney or gallstones) from between the seat and female reproductive organs, not centrally but to the left side, with the incision aligned with the stone and your finger in the seat as you push it outwards. The cut is made wide on the outside and narrow on the inside as much as possible for the stone's removal.
This passage explains that if I were to press the finger in the seat where the stone is during the cut, the stone might come out easily without much difficulty. And be aware that there may be corners and edges on some stones which could make it harder for them to come out.
Some of them are smooth like beechwood and cylindrical, making their removal easy. If they have corners or edges however, they might require a slightly larger cut. If they don't come out this way, it may be necessary to adapt the technique, for example by gripping them with tweezers firmly attached at one end, similar to forceps.
To secure the stone so it doesn't slip away, or else you might introduce a thin, polished tool from beneath it. If it's difficult to do that way, slightly widen the cut. Should you have some blood, remove it using a scalpel.
If there are more than one, first push the largest into the bladder's mouth, then cut it open. After that, push the smaller ones out. Do this if you have more than two stones, however if a stone is extremely large, cutting an extensive incision to remove it would be ill-advised as it may result in one of two issues.
Alternatively, he may die or else continuous urinary stricture will occur as the affected area simply doesn't heal properly. Try to push it out until it comes out, or break it with forceps until it can be removed piece by piece.
If you have finished your work, cleanse the wound with vinegar and patience, then add some wax and bind it firmly. Cover it with a small puncture filled with oil or liquor and cold water to cool down the hot tumour. The patient should lie on his back without changing position until the third day; no removal of bandages should be done by that time.
If the scab falls off, wash the area with a lot of water and oil. Then treat it with nuxia and balsamic ointments until it heals. If there is an exposed hot lump or any other like symptoms such as clotting of blood in the bladder preventing urine from passing through; one can identify this by seeing blood coming out along with urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood. If it remains, it indicates infection in the bladder and its putrefaction; then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt. Treat each kind of condition according to what suits it until it heals.
In every stage of treatment, it is necessary to support both legs and keep them together for stability on the medication applied to the site. If the stone is small and has moved into the urethra causing inflammation that prevents urine from passing through, treat it with what I have described before it reaches the incision.
Very often, I have been able to avoid making the incision with this treatment. This is what I tried and it works like this:.
Like a sharp triangular end, it's embedded in a reed. Then you take a thread and bind the penis under the stone to prevent it from going back into the bladder. Then you insert the shackle's nail gently until the shackle reaches the same stone.
You manipulate the shackle with your hand on the same stone a little bit at a time, while you bore through it until you puncture it from the other side. Urine then starts to flow out of its chamber. Afterwards, you keep your hand on what's left of the stone outside the penis; it breaks apart and comes out along with urine, resulting in healing for the patient.
If this treatment is not prepared for you, due to an obstacle that prevents you from doing so, tie a thread under the stone and another above it then cut through the stone inside the member between the threads and then remove it.
Then remove the thread and cleanse the clotted blood that has accumulated in the wound. It is necessary to tie the thread under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other thread above, so when the thread is removed after removing the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
For this reason, if you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns when you urinate and covers the wound as we said.
The sixty-first chapter.
In the removal of stones in women.
Stone is rarely found in women, but if one of them has a stone, it makes the treatment difficult and prevents many things. One reason could be that the woman might still be young, and another is that you won't find a woman willing to expose herself to a doctor.
If she is menstruating or from those who are under purdah and the third reason is that you won't find a woman to practice this craft, especially with her hands. And the fourth reason is that the place of cutting the stone in women is far from the position of the stone, so it needs an additional incision.
In this case, there is a risk. If necessity calls for that, it should be taken to a qualified female physician who rarely exists. If she cannot be found, seek out a menstruating companion doctor or bring in an experienced woman knowledgeable about women's matters, or find some reference in the field of this craft among capable women.
Open the urethra and instruct her to perform all that you tell her to regarding inspecting the stone first. This means she should look if the woman is capable for it, allowing a finger to enter her cavity and examine the stone; if found, press it under her finger.
When that happens, you instruct her to cut open. If she is not young and is thorny, the surgeon should insert a finger into the woman's vagina and inspect for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and vigorously squeezing it.
If found, it is necessary to guide it from the mouth of the bladder down to her utmost limit until she reaches the origin of the thigh. Then cut open for her in front of half of her vagina at the origin of the thigh on whichever side that gives access and she felt the stone in that area.
Her finger should not leave the stone, pressing it underneath. The cut should be small first, then insert a tool in this tiny incision. If she feels the stone, she can increase the size of the cut as much as needed for the stone to pass through. Remember that there are various types of stones.
Some are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, twisted or with branches. Recognize these types so you can decide accordingly on what to do next. If the blood flow is abundant, dab on the treated, faded area and hold until the bleeding stops, then resume your work.
Until the stone is out. Remember to use the tools that you mentioned for extracting stones from men, which may assist in your work here. If there's abundant blood loss and you understand its pulse to be of an interrupted artery, place the clamps on the site.
Tighten with force by the aids, don't stop until you've left it alone, leave the stone and don't remove it; perhaps it might kill the patient. Then treat the wound; if the bleeding stops after days and the site has purified itself, return to your work until the stone is expelled.
The second chapter and seventy.
In the section on the water-bearing fallopian tube.
The water-bearing fallopian tubes are simply the assembly of moisture in the white duct located under the skin covering the egg and known as the scrotum. It is called a rete and may be found within its own special membrane, which is arranged by nature near one end of the egg.
Until one might think it's another egg, and this exists between the scrotum skin and the white duct (rete) we mentioned. This doesn't happen except in rarity, and these fallopian tubes are produced due to weakness that affects women, so this substance is developed for them having been exposed to blows on women.
This moisture can have various colors; it may resemble yellow gall, or be red and bloody, or appear as dark reddish-brown, or be white and watery - which is the most common. The distinguishing signs that identify this condition are:
Where there is water accumulation, if it's in the white duct as described earlier, the tumor will be somewhat elongated along its length like an egg shape. The testicles are not visible because of the moisture surrounding them from all sides.
And if the moisture is in its own special membrane, the tumor will be elongated towards one end of the egg.
That's why people assume it to be another egg, because the moisture is between the scrotal skin and the white duct. If the moisture is felt under touch, but if you want to know its color, apply a square sponge over the tumor after advancing its image. What comes out from the sponge serves as an indicator of what's inside.
If we proceed to treatment with iron, it should be ordered that the patient be bled if he can endure it and you see his body full. Then lie him on his back on something slightly elevated and place under him many punctures. Sit yourself on his left side.
And you should order a servant to sit on his right side stretching his gaze towards one of my sides of the scrotum and towards the abdomen outlet. Then take an elongated spatula, and cut open the scrotal skin from the middle along its length close to the thigh.
The cut should be straight and parallel to the line that divides the scrotal skin into two halves until it reaches the white sac containing semen. You should remove this sac and be careful not to cut too deeply, and your removal of the cut should be as deep as possible on the side that sticks to the testicle.
Then, wet the full sac with water widely and fully, then remove all of the water. Then widen between the edges of the cut with scissors and stretch the sac upwards without touching the scrotal containing skin. Cut the tie as much as you can either in one piece or in pieces.
Especially the softer part of it, if you do not remove the cut section, water might come back. If during your operation the egg comes out from its skin despite you, when you finish cutting the tie, fold it again and then sew together the edges of the scrotal skin with stitches.
Then treat him with the treatment of all surgeries until he recovers. If the testicle was affected and got damaged from another disease, it may be necessary to tie the blood vessels in the scrotum to prevent bleeding, then cut off the foreskin and take out the testicle. Then treat him according to what we mentioned.
If the water congeals in both ends, know that they are two ends. Cut through the other end as you did with the first; if it pleases you to make this one action, do so and then wipe off the blood.
And insert in the slits some wool that has been soaked in oil or rose butter, and on the outside place another layer of wool that has been soaked in wine and oil. Lay this out over both testicles and the abdominal cavity, and put a folded patch on top; these are called bandages. And tie it from above with the strap shown in this picture, which has six ends.
And take two strips and fold them, then fill them with the wet wool as illustrated here. Create ends that can be fastened using cotton or wet wool balls, tie them with a string on your belt, one end to the backrest.
And the second strip you take towards your elbow, with both ends on the thighs from below and the remaining two ends on the hips. Gather all the ties together on your belt. These bandages can also be made using a needle instead of cutting with iron.
And you should take a small, sharp knife to cut through the scrotal skin as we have described until the white membrane containing the fluid is revealed. Then take another tool shown in this picture:".
And it resembles the Greek eye. Then apply it to that membrane until all moisture is drained out, then cover the opening with bandages and carefully remove any fluid containing sacs with a knife, cutting them as much as you can until all are removed without touching the yolk sac to avoid burning it.
And know that this procedure is cleaner, avoids bleeding, and is better than cutting. If anything obstructs your path while cutting or during sewing, burns hot objects, bleeding, or any other thing that you must address when it obstructs your work, treat it according to the appropriate method as described.
If the patient is stubborn and cannot endure this operation due to its severity, they should use anesthesia on what I describe. This should be prepared according to your capabilities using our provided evidence.
The bladders are aqueous, hence the patient should sit on a high stool. Then insert the tumor from below with a wide forceps under it and place the anesthesia along the body length ensuring that all water can flow out completely. Then put cotton on the site and tie it.
Let him squeeze out the rest of the water. Then treat him until his wound heals. If water still leaks while he is under anesthesia, this might be because the white membrane gets blocked at the wound's opening and prevents the water from leaving.
In that case, it would be necessary to insert a porcupine hair or the instrument used by lovers of water extraction which has been depicted in pictures or slightly increase the opening of the wound.
And know that water may return and accumulate after six months or around that time. If it accumulates, reapply anesthesia in the same manner, and let the patient endure his days.
The sixty-third chapter.
In the section about fatty flesh bladders and their treatment.
And know that cutting into these fatty bladders often leads to ruin in most cases, which is why I advise leaving them and ensuring their safety while remembering the procedure and types of tumor.
I say that many tumors can occur in the bodies that make up female structures, and this is due to multiple reasons either from excess urine draining into the female organs or from a blow. The color of the tumor matches the body's color and it does not contain water.
The tumor is jelly-like, and perhaps the tumor has a changed color like meat with no sensation to it. It could be due to complications of veins and their dilation as previously mentioned or from the dilation of veins causing that, making it known through the disappearance of the tumor.
If it sticks when pinched and does not become fluid, whereas if it's due to the dilation of veins, nothing disappears during pinching. This type could be distinguished from other tissues by this characteristic.
And to perform it, you would cut the scrotal skin then pull out the testicle upwards and remove it from the white scrotum. You will free the tubes from the surrounding tissues, tie the tubes and cut them after removing everything from all sides of the testicle, provided that the testicle hasn't stuck to these growing tissues.
Then you need to remove and cut the testicle. If there is adhesion between some parts of the scrotum or among the tubes, it must be carefully removed and cut in one piece.
If the tissue grows in a location of attachment that is behind, it should be cut completely and then you remove the testicle as we have said. Once your work is done, suture the wound with oiled cotton thread saturated with wine or oil, then heal it with other treatments until it heals.
The forty-sixth section.
In treating hernias that occur in the navel area.
The vulva is a tumor that spreads somewhat like a knot with relaxation in women, causing difficulty in movement, sports, and walking. In treating this condition among the gynecological issues, it's similar to what was previously mentioned.
But we should remember to perform the operation as the predecessors did, and I say that it is necessary for the patient to sit on a raised chair, then push the woman's pubis down, and hold the scrotum skin with your fingers near the penis's arteries.
But a servant other than you holds her firmly and extends her very much. Then, with a sharp, wide surgical knife, he makes a deep incision until the veins are exposed by scraping along the arteries with his foot. Then, he cuts it from both sides as we talked about before when explaining how to cut the veins of the breasts. Finally, he inserts a needle in it which has a double thread.
And she ties it at the first position that the doctor offered her, also at the last. Then, she makes a vertical incision in the middle of it, along the whole body length, and removes all accumulated foul moisture.
Then, treat the gynecological surgeries as you would for other surgeries, with a recovery period. This allows vessels feeding one of the females to fall off. There's nothing wrong with that. If the doctor offers to perform on all arteries, it should be done so that at least one female is removed along with her vessels in order not to deprive the eggs of their nourishment. By cutting off the arteries, it deflates and it is not beneficial.
The fifty-sixth chapter.
In treating intestinal dysentery.
The occurrence of this diarrhea is due to a cut that opens along the abdomen, in the direction towards the kidneys, from the abdominal cavities. The intestines then drain through this defect into one of the females.
This defect can either be due to a cut in the abdomen or its extension. Both of these types are among many causes, possibly from being hit, scratched, crying or lifting something heavy and similar actions. Its symptom is if it's caused by an extension of the abdomen, it will occur little by little over a long period of time.
Unexpectedly, the tumor becomes level with about half of its depth before the stricture presses on the intestine. Its sign is that when pressing at the beginning of the stricture, it causes intense pain in a single thrust and the tumor appears differently under the skin nearby.
And this occurs through the exit of the intestine and its direction towards outside from the stricture, and it may come out with the intestine the fistula, which is called this type of hernia being intestinal and fistular. It might be accompanied by gas, and it might produce feces in the intestine that gets trapped there causing depletion of the moisture.
Because it causes intense pain and gurgling sounds, especially when squeezing. Treatments for this condition involving iron are risky; one should be cautious about falling into such practices. The treatment is to instruct the moisture to push the intestine back inside his body if it attempts to return.
Then, he lies between your hands with his legs raised. Extend the skin behind the pubis upwards and cut all over the scrotum in length. Then, insert canals into each side of the cut opening as much as needed to widen it.
The cut should be as long as the testicle can pass through it. Then, excise the pouches under the scrotum skin until you reveal the white, hard sciatic on both sides. Once this is done, insert your little finger towards the testicle.
Between the white sciatic beneath the testicle skin and the second sciatic, cut away any adhesion behind the testicle. Then, bend your right hand into the scrotal skin and simultaneously extend the white sciatic upwards with your left hand. Elevate the testicle along with the sciatic towards the cut.
The servant is commanded to extend the egg upwards and release the adhesive behind completely with a thorough pull, then use your finger to check for anything left of the contained fat in the hard white duct. If you find something from it, push it down into the stomach below.
Then take a needle containing thick thread that has been split into ten threads, and enter it at the last duct located under the scrotal skin following the cut. Then cut both ends of the thread until there are four strands left. Then, some of them are assembled together in a solid form and the duct that we mentioned to be under the scrotal skin is tied tightly from two sides with it. Also, both ends of the threads are looped and tied firmly so that nothing can reach anything from among the vessels that nourish them. So that no hot tumor may occur from it, and also a second band is made outside the first one more than two fingers away. After these two bands, he leaves enough of the duct under the scrotal skin as long as an adult's finger bone.
So that no hot tumor may occur from it, and also a second band is made outside the first one more than two fingers away. After these two bands, he leaves enough of the duct under the scrotal skin as long as an adult's finger bone. Cut the rest completely in a circular motion and remove the egg with it, then make a cut below the scrotal skin that lets blood and fluid drain out as described previously. After this, he uses cotton dipped in oil and places it in the wound, and uses the bandage as described before.
The white duct, as mentioned after its careful removal from blood leakage which often occurs, may dry out too much. Leave the bandage until it falls by itself; if it falls slowly, pour hot water over it and carry on applying heat until it drops off.
Then treat the wound with all other treatments for wounds until it heals.
The sixty-first chapter.
In this windpipe condition, I have not seen anyone daring to treat it with iron. Among the first things mentioned was that it should be made as described in the windpipe with dalaya, which is to tie the arteries beneath the cut line gently below.
Then make a cut in the middle and treat the tumor with what opens it until the arteries fall out, then treat the wound as we have mentioned until it heals.
The seventy-first chapter.
In the hernia that occurs in the rib area.
Hernias in the rib area, as we have described, occur at a specific location and do not descend to any part of the female genital organs. If they did descend, it would be a mild case and would always return.
However, if the time is prolonged, the incision in the thorax cavity increases until the intestines and the orifice descend into the chest cavity. This condition occurs from the extension of the thorax opening that we described earlier. That is, the thorax cavity extends, then relaxes and retracts, displacing the position and causing a hernia. The treatment for this is with iron, as I have already described its method.
This condition can be treated with iron, whereby the patient lies on his back between your hands and a cut is made at the warm spot of the hernia horizontally to three fingers' width. Then widen the chest cavities underneath the skin.
Until the white chest cavity behind it is exposed; you then take a needle and place it on the affected area of the chest cavity, pressing it into the depth of the abdomen. Then you stitch the affected areas onto one end of the needle from the chest cavity and secure them together with stitches.
Then drain the pus from the wound but do not cut the scrotum completely or touch the testicles, and do not do anything else as I taught you in treating blind intestinal diseases. Then treat it with surgical treatment.
If the threads have stopped, clean it and tighten the wound until it disappears, so that the scrotum contracts without increasing the hernia.
And the hook is better in this position because it is closer to safety.
The eighty-sixth chapter.
In relaxing the skin of the scrotum.
Often, the skin of the scrotum relaxes in some people without relaxing the muscles inside it, and its appearance is unpleasant. Anyone who wishes to treat it should lie on their back.
And cut all the relaxed skin on the tough skin, then bring together the edges of the skin. If you wish, you may stitch first, then stitch the relaxed skin in three or four threads and check the stitches afterwards, then cut between the threads.
Then treat it with other surgical treatments until it heals and the stitches fall out.
The ninety-sixth chapter.
In circumcision.
Circumcision is prohibited in our religion.
For this reason, it was necessary for me not to mention it in my book, but rather I mentioned it because of two reasons: one is that when a doctor is asked about it, he will know the treatment of what has encountered it and the other reason is that we often need circumcision for our benefits on some animals.
Regarding the castrations of camels, donkeys, cats and so on from animals, I say that castration can be done in two ways either by impotence or by cut and removal, where if it is done by impotence then his method is to place the animal in hot water until its females relax, soften and hang down.
Then you subdue it with your hand until it dissolves and does not become apparent upon touch, as for castration by cut and removal, you should hold the animal and squeeze its testicles skin with your left hand then tie them up and make a single cut on each testicle.
Even if the two testicles protrude, cut them after removing their skin, do not leave any fat on them except for the delicate one that is on the blood vessels. This type of castration is better than the one done by impotence.
Because impotence may leave something of the females behind, so the animal might want to mate. Then treat the wound until it heals.
The seventy-seventh chapter.
In treating feminization.
Feminization occurs in men in two ways: one where it appears as a space or on the skin between the females, resembling a woman's vagina with hair. It can also secrete urine from the one that is within the scrotal skin.
And as for women, there is only one type which appears above the vagina like male members of small size emerging from both sides like a man's penis. The two are like females and the treatment for these three types.
The two types of men and the single type of women should have that excess flesh cut off until their remnants are gone. Then, they need to be treated with regular surgical remedies until recovery occurs. As for the second type among men which discharges urine from the scrotal skin, there is no function or impact of this.
The fortieth and seventieth chapter.
In the section about removing the testicles and other female reproductive organs.
The testicles may increase beyond the normal amount, becoming swollen and disfiguring, and this can be greatly enhanced in some women to the point of spreading like men, causing them to engage in sexual intercourse.
You should grasp the testicle with your hand or a tool and cut it, but don't linger on the cutting process nor particularly at the base of the shaft to avoid excessive bleeding.
Then, treat it with surgical wound care until it heals. As for the excrescence, it is a growing flesh inside the womb cavity until it fills it.
It may also protrude outward like a tail. For this reason, some early medical texts refer to it as the disease of the tail and it should be cut off in the same way that one cuts off the testicles, and then treated until it heals.
The second and seventieth chapter.
In the treatment of warts.
Warts are when a woman's vagina is not penetrated or the hole is small, and it can either be naturally born with that and thus be normal, or it can be due to a cause that has progressed, which could involve an excess of growing flesh.
Or it could be thin or thick, and it can either be in the depth of the womb or on its sides, above or below it. It prevents sexual intercourse, coitus, and birth and may also prevent menstruation. Knowing this comes through observation by a gynecologist.
If the obstruction is visible and close, then if it is not visible you should examine it with your fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is thin skin and close to the lips of the vagina, then act quickly to puncture it. You would place what resembles suture material on the lips of the vagina and then apply all your fingers from both hands.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread, then pushes the saphenous veins hard until she penetrates the delicate artery and opens the dam. Then she takes wool, dips it in oil, places it on the spot, and has the woman reunite every day so that the spot does not heal over again.
If the artery is thick and dense, it may be necessary to cut it with a broad scalpel resembling paper-thin. If the dam is made of tender flesh, sew it using needles and cut it off. You should have on hand clotting agents for non-toxic bleeding such as kaolin, rhubarb, milk curdled by egg white.
Then, she uses a wide copper tube so that the wound does not heal quickly. She holds it for days and then uses dry cotton swabs. Afterwards, she treats with all other treatments for edema until he heals. There may be another meat plant in the uterus that needs to be cut like this.
If it is not a cancerous tumor, then a cancerous tumor in the uterus should not be treated with iron alone.
The seventy-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of hemorrhoids, vaginal discharges, and red warts that occur in women's thighs.
As for hemorrhoids, it is an expansion of the veins' mouths to the extent that blood pours out in great quantities continuously. If the hemorrhoids are widespread, they become discharges. I mentioned their types and symptoms in the previous section; we will cover them here.
What is acceptable for treatment and what is not, I say that hemorrhoids and discharges, if they are deep within the uterus and not palpable, do not have a treatment with iron. The ones in the opening of the uterus that get touched by touch are the ones to be treated.
One must have the woman enter a cold room, then spread the towels with a brush or rough scrubbing tool and cut them from their roots, leaving her under bleeding when the clotting blood is discharged without caressing.
Like rubbing with sponges, sticks and milk and similar items. Then raise her legs against the wall for an hour and then let them hang in cold water. If bleeding persists, make her sit on a bed of coriander seeds and almond shells and their like. Then take the flour of wheat, mix it with honey and yogurt.
Secure it on her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise fix the casted limbs and the breasts without condition, then take wool and immerse it in pomegranate juice or pregnancy tongue juice or wild olive branch juice with anise drink and immobilize the position.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with the ointment until it heals. As for the red pus, it resembles the heads of scabies, it is coarse-looking; it may be that what appeared from it should be cut according to what was mentioned in the towels, and then heal it until it heals.
Chapter Fourty-Seventh.
In the abortion that manifests in the womb.
Various types of tumors may manifest in the womb, such as cancer, calcified tumor, ulcers, pus-filled lesions, devouring tumors, ingrowths, hemorrhoids, fissures, towels, and hot tumors. All these diseases and their types along with their symptoms were mentioned in this section.
In this article, we must mention the hot tumor that manifests in the womb if it is among tumors that accumulate for a long time. It should be noted that its hardness resembles iron. You should observe that when it begins to hurt intensely with two beats and inflammation and fever.
I saw him red if he feels the sensation, do not hurry with pressure and treat him with what aids maturity until these symptoms settle. Then it is advisable for the woman to sit on a chair with two seats and lean against its back.
And she should gather her legs towards the lower abdomen, have her thighs spread apart and have her arms under her knees, and fasten them with a belt that is suitable.
Therefore, the midwife sits on the right side and uses the device with which she opens the womb's mouth, which appears later. It is necessary when you want to use this device that you estimate the depth of the woman's womb so that what enters from the device does not exceed the depth of the womb.
If the device exceeds the depth, it will harm the pregnant woman. Therefore, aids should be placed on the cervix's mouth to prevent the whole device from entering the womb's depth. It is necessary that the tube running inside the device is from the top side.
And you hold the device, while the servant moves the tube until it opens the cervix. If the discharge appears and can be touched with a soft texture, it is necessary to cut it at its head with a wide clamp when all the time has drained completely.
It is necessary that you leave a soft thread soaked in rose oil or green oil with some grip inside the cut. This thread should come out of the incision in the cervix and it should be wrapped in clean wool outside on the womb and on the thighs, which has been immersed in boiling water with some baked bread added.
Then, you should treat her with the ointment suitable for this purpose until she recovers after two days.
And the womb and the wound may be washed with a pour of water and honey, then from water that has boiled with myrrh or a long reed, after which return to vaginal lubrication; if discharge is hidden within the womb.
One should refrain from treating it with iron, but use what we mentioned in this section for treatment.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
In teaching how to treat living embryos if they emerge in an atypical manner.
The midwife should first know the natural birth, so if you see a woman getting pregnant downwards and craving to breathe fresh air while feeling relieved during childbirth, it indicates normal pregnancy.
And the baby comes out quickly, so know that this birth will be natural and that it will come out with its head and placenta or hanging from the breech. If you see these signs, it is necessary to squeeze her belly so that the baby can come out fast.
And when it descends on its head, the placenta also descends with him and cleanses from that waste properly. Aside from this birth, it is not natural and is reprehensible because the baby may come out on its feet, and its hands come out before its head and feet.
And one of its hands or foot, or it comes out with its head and hand or comes out curled up, perhaps it might have flipped onto its forehead, and so on - these are all reprehensible shapes. The midwife should be vigilant and careful about all these things, and she must beware of accidents and mistakes.
And I explain every form of it and how to handle each one, so that you can use these as guidance and establish your actions. When the baby comes out on its head, this is natural birth and the woman will strengthen at that moment making it difficult for her expulsion; noticing that her strength has weakened, you should seat her on a chair while instructing women to prepare her properly.
To lengthen the uterus, he adds cooked saucepans and wet tonics, then the midwife inserts a small pinch between her fingers which she uses to rupture or cut the placenta until its moisture flows out. She presses the woman's belly until the baby descends.
If the baby doesn't descend, it is necessary to inject the woman with saliva from a saucepan mixed with anorectal ointment. Then she should be instructed to tighten and sneeze through her nose while holding her mouth and nostrils shut tightly; this will cause the fetus to come out of its position. If the baby's hand comes out first, it is necessary to gently guide them back a little at a time.
If she doesn't enter, have the woman lie on a bench and lift her legs up. Then shake the bench to the ground while the woman holds onto it so that she doesn't fall when shaken. If the hands don't enter and the baby dies, cut off both hands and pull out the rest of the baby.
Or tie his hands with a stick and pull them moderately; he will come out this way. If the baby comes down on its legs, it should be pushed up. Then, slowly turn the baby until it is straight. Then take one of its legs and extend it gradually.
If they have come down to the thighs, command her to tighten and sneeze through her nose while using the nosegay. He will then come out if he does not come out as described and otherwise gently turn the baby until it is in its natural position; he will then come out smoothly if all that was described cannot be done.
Take saliva from the hump and saucepan, ointment for the anus, and dissolved camel's dung. Strike them all in the bath with a good beat, then take it to clean out her vagina and under her belly. Then place her in warm water until it reaches the kidneys.
If you notice that it has ascended from below, create for it a cushion to carry and let it bear it. If the cushion lasts an hour, then make her sit on the chair, then rub her gently and close her mouth and nose, and squeeze gently under her abdomen; the fetus will come out of its case, birth of the fetus on its knees and hands.
If it comes out in this manner, allow her to gently insert both of her hands slightly at a time. Then, the woman should lie on her side and hang down her buttocks lower downwards while she is lying on the bed. She would then hold her hands together, and gently squeeze above her abdomen very slightly. Then, remove what is under her feet from the pillows until they are lowered downwards. If the fetus doesn't come out, take both of her legs and move them abruptly. Then gently squeeze over the hips very slightly until the fetus ascends upwards. Then, the midwife should enter her hand and adjust the fetus very slightly.
And command the woman to wriggle until the fetus comes out, birth of the fetus is obstructed by one of her hands, she should take back her hand if she can't. If she can't stand then make her stand and let her walk. If she can't walk then lie down on.
Put her on the bed and shake her legs strongly. Then use the tongue spatula described as saliva application. If it takes effect, make her sit on a chair then help in moving her hand back and adjusting the fetus to its natural position. Rub the woman and command her to wriggle until the birth.
The birth of the fetus is on her side with its hands spread out, and its face towards her back. It should be advised to hold the midwife's hand in that case, then gently move it slightly and adjust it carefully. If it is adjusted properly, carry what we described from oil and saliva on the forehead.
Then there is the operation of moving her a little bit. If she does this, place her on the chair and order her to lean to the right side. Then let her sweat and wipe off with camphor, for it comes out, like the birth of the fetus, standing on one side.
If it descends to the womb in this position with the placenta, cut the placenta with your nail until all moisture discharges. If it adheres to the face of the fetus or its neck, cut it from the side so that it does not choke and die. Then push the fetus inside until it is in the right position.
Instruct the woman to sweat multiple times, as it facilitates its passage, the birth of twins or many offspring. Know that twins often give birth and may give birth to three or four, but they live only if it is rare. As for five, this is outside nature; they do not survive at all.
They surround them, even if they are numerous, with a single placenta. They spread apart by a barrier across their mouths which is tied to the side of each one, and they may come out as the single fetus would naturally in an easy birth, or they come out as we described, in a condemned manner.
If some of them have difficulty during birth and become like the shapes we described as unnatural, treat them as we described. Let her who is able to be gentle do what she does with care and caution, adapting herself to every shape according to the strategy that makes her ready for safety.
Explain what is imagined inside the womb of the fetus. It could imagine one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or more than ten fetuses. I have heard that a woman gave birth to seven and another fifteen; all were imagined in this way.
Out of respect for the esteemed comprehender, this is all that should be in the science of gynecology. Perhaps one day it may come her way and she should meet it with what is fitting.
The sixtieth and seventh chapter.
In the expulsion of the dead fetus.
If you treated the dead fetus with the treatment mentioned in the section, and it did not come out and forced your hand to act physically, then you should look. If she is strong and has nothing of the symptoms that one fears may cause damage, then you should have her lie on a bed on her back.
And her head is tilted downwards, and her legs are raised, with a slave adjusting it from both sides or tying her to the bed so that her body does not pull when the fetus is pushed out.
Then she moistens the womb with wet cloths and saliva of the cat, mixed with butter. The surgeon then applies these substances to her hand and enters it gently into the womb. She then seeks a place for the fetus to be extracted through its head or body. This is done by forcing the fetal parts against the canals where they will puncture and assist in their removal.
Look, if the fetus is presenting head down and has a chance of descending through his head, insert the instruments into his eyes or nose, mouth, buttocks, genital area or under his beard. Or near his spine or under the ribs.
And if it presents on its feet, then in the buttocks and middle of the back. It should be held with the right hand and rest of her left fingers are interlocked between the thumb and index finger. The hand enters gently and the tool is inserted into some of those places we mentioned.
Until you reach a hollow place, then insert another metal implement or a third if needed to ensure the pull is equal and not inclined towards any direction. Then extend it evenly, not just straight but also moving it in every direction.
It should facilitate its removal as it is done with the tooth when extracting, and there should be an easing in extending it. If it gets stuck on one side during this process, it would be advisable to apply oil to some of the fingers and insert them from that side to rotate what has been stuck. Should some fetus come out, then move the tools to other positions.
You should lift it slightly and do this until the fetus comes out completely, if one hand came before the other and couldn't be pushed back because of being pressed, then you would wrap it with a thorn and pull it until all of it has come out and then cut it.
Either in the elbow joint or at the shoulder blade, this is how you should do it with the other hand and the legs. If the fetus's head is large and broad and there is pressure during its exit or if there is collected water at its head, then you should insert a curved prong between the fingers.
You would use it to cut through the head so that the water can come out, or you might use a tool called the 'shidakh' machine which has its picture given with pictures of other tools in the next chapter.
In the same manner, if the fetus has a large head naturally, you should cut the skull or cut it with the shidakh tool as we said, then remove the bones with forceps. If the head comes out and gets compressed during pressure, cut until the body fluid from the chest drains.
If it then joins the chest, but if the chest does not join and there is no exit for it, cut in sections as you can. If it was near the bottom of the abdomen and it's twisted or had pus, you should massage to allow the fluid to drain from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, then the pulling of it would be easy and the settling towards the womb's mouth should happen here. If it presses against the belly or chest, it seems necessary to pull it with a pin that you have wrapped in your hand until you cut through the belly or chest till what is inside flows out.
If you have extracted all the organs and pulled back the head but it is being held, then enter your left hand. If the womb's mouth is open, insert your hand into the neck of the womb and hold the head with it, pulling it in with your fingers towards the womb's mouth. Then, insert a retractor or two and pull it/them out with it/her/him.
If the womb's mouth has become stuck to a hot tumor that is wide, it should not be forced. In such case, it would be advisable to use wet and oily substances for things like this and to use ointments, sitting in water that soothes and moisturizes.
And if the fetus is on its side, it can be smoothed out. In this case, use what we have mentioned for living fetuses; however, if that's not possible, then cut and remove it. It should not leave anything of the placenta inside completely. Once you've finished treating your condition, then apply the treatment we mentioned for hot tumors that occur within the womb.
If there is a bleeding, you should immerse yourself in water and use all the treatments. I have seen a woman who became pregnant but died inside her womb before giving birth to her child; she then got pregnant again.
Then, the other fetus also died. It took her a long time for it to show symptoms. A tumor appeared in her abdomen that grew and became so large it opened up, causing pus to come out. I was called upon to treat her and I treated her over a long period of time without the wound healing completely. I then applied some very strong ointments to it, which helped.
He removed a bone from the wound, then after days another bone came out. She was amazed by this, given that the abdomen is a region without bones. She assumed it to be remnants of dead fetus's bones, so she examined the wound and extracted numerous bones, particularly from the head of the fetus.
I continued following this until I removed a large number of bones. The woman was in the best of her health and she had been living like this for some time from that spot, leaving a lingering discharge. And here I have brought you this rare condition.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the doctor tries to achieve with his treatment.
The seventy-seventh chapter.
In this section, there are images of the machines that are needed for delivering the baby.
A picture of a device used to open the cervix:.
This binding tool that you use for books either has two corkscrews at the ends of the sticks, but this cork should be softer than the binding and either made of waxwood or poplar wood. The width of each stick should be as thick as a finger.
And bend their ends towards a finger, and their length is a span and half. In the middle of the sticks are two rods made from the same type of wood as the sticks; they are fastened in these sticks. The length of each rod could be half a span or slightly more, and their width would be about a finger's breadth or slightly more. These two rods serve to strengthen the structure.
They are the two that enter the cervix, and they open the twine when you operate on the corkscrews. Another tool for this purpose exists, one that is softer and lighter:.
It is made of waxwood or poplar wood, shaped like a ladle. However, it has two rods at its end as you see; the length of each rod is about a span and their width is roughly one finger. If you wish to open the cervix with it.
Place the woman on a couch, spreading her legs and placing them apart between her thighs. Then insert these two guides in both the entrance of the womb, while holding the device's end from below between her hips. Then open your hand with the device as you do with your fingers, according to how much opening of the womb you desire. Until the midwife achieves what she desires, an illustration of another device mentioned by the pioneers:.
Illustration of the ballista used to push the baby out:.
Illustration of the forceps used to extract the baby's head:..
It resembles the scissors that have teeth at their end as you see, and it may be made rectangular like tweezers on this picture; it has teeth like saw teeth that cut and scrape.
Illustration of a ballista also:.
Illustration of forceps:
This ishoulder rest, where the hardness should be slight so that it does not break when used to pull on the baby, illustration of a shoulder rest with two prongs:.
Illustration of broad pincers for cutting the baby:
All of these devices, the more varieties there are and the more they are prepared by the maker, the faster he can do his work and the higher he is esteemed for his capability. Do not disdain to have any device that should be prepared for you, since it will inevitably become necessary.
The eighty-seventh chapter.
In the delivery of the placenta.
If the placenta becomes retained after childbirth, it is necessary to tell the midwife to hold herself still, then make her sneeze using a whisk and clench your hand on her mouth and nostrils. If she expels the placenta in this way, otherwise take some force.
Pierce the cover with a hole and place therein opened herbs like fomentation, anusia, broom root, poppy, cypress, thyme, savory and hyssop. All of these medicines or some combinations thereof should be immersed in water and put on fire to cook them. Then place a gold tube over this hole in the lid's cover and leave the other end at the mouth of the womb.
Hold on to it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then cough as we have said; this will cause the placenta to be expelled quickly. If she did not come out even after this treatment and remained inside, the midwife was instructed to dip her left hand in a unguent of kermes or wormwood saliva.
Then she will enter her hand into the uterus and search for the placenta. When it touches, she grasps it and pulls on it a little bit at a time until it is expelled. If it was adhering deeply in the womb, she will reach inside as we described until she finds the placenta; then gently pull it out a little bit at a time using the abdominal muscles.
In order not to tear the uterus during intense pulling, it should be gently moved towards the right and left sides first. Then gradually increase the force of pulling; she will respond then and get rid of sticking. If the mouth of the womb is closed, we have described treatments like coughing therapy and treatment with pots and herbs.
If it doesn't come out as we have described, you may use force in pulling again but you should tie what has come out from her to the woman's thigh. Then clean her with the four-in-one ointment; this will purify her after a few days.
She will dissolve and come out, except when she is purified, then a bad smell emerges to the stomach and head, which harms the patient; it is necessary to use the appropriate incense.
Therefore, some pioneers have tried the tannin of figs and oak bark smoke, a picture of the machine in which the woman evaporates when there is retention of menses and obstetric strangulation and so on.
It is made from lead that resembles a clamp, or it is made of copper where the delicate tip is placed at the front and the wide end on the fire. A stick is tied to it so that when this incense goes out, you replace it.
Chapter ninety-seven.
In the treatment of the non-infected bed sore.
Many males may be born with their bedsores not infected, possibly sealed by a thin fold. It would be advisable for the surgeon to pierce this fold with her finger; otherwise, she should press it with a sharp scissor and take care not to touch the muscle.
Then, she covers it with wool that has been soaked in the drink and oil. Then, she treats it with ointments until it heals. If you fear it might get clogged, insert a lead pipe into the hole for many days, then remove it when the child starts to pass stool.
The obstruction of the bed sore might also be due to a wound or tumor. It may require cutting through this opening, then treating it with the mentioned treatment methods and ointments.
Chapter eighty.
In the treatment of warts that occur on the bottom.
Warts that occur on the bottom are knots or masses that occur near the bed sore from inside or in one of the sides, and the wart can be single or multiple.
If this lump opens, a watery white or viscous moisture will flow out of it, possibly coming from warts that have penetrated the scrotum and the intestine. The non-penetrated ones may be identified by what comes out of them when used during sexual intercourse, such as stool and odor.
Perhaps it would come out, and there might be sperm ducts if they are inserted into the space that goes to the bladder and to the urinary passage, and they might also go to the thigh joint and the tip of the tail. Also, the known inserted one going to the seat is distinguished from those not inserted.
To insert your dominant finger into the seat and to introduce a thin probe made of bronze or iron into the duct if there is no ridge inside it. If there is a ridge, then insert a thin lead probe or a horse hair into it.
Until you feel the probe or the hair on your finger, if you do not feel it at all and nothing sticks out of the hole like feces, smell, or worms as we said, then know that it is not inserted. Act quickly to seek treatment.
If the duct is inserted to the bladder or urinary passage, its indication is the expulsion of urine from it and its inability to heal with medication. However, if it's inserted to the thigh joint or tip of the tail, then its indicator is reaching the probe there.
If there is no ridge leading to the bone and pain occurs in a particular direction with constant pus discharge, and treatment does not alleviate it nor does it heal over time. All such inserted ducts show that complete recovery is unlikely.
Treating them is a futile effort for those who are deceived by the doctors, however, as long as they are not inserted and do not show chronic symptoms, recovery can be hoped for through iron treatment as I describe and what I have experimented with. This involves making the patient lie down on their back between your hands.
He lifts his legs upwards and leans his thighs towards his belly, then a lead or iron probe is introduced into the duct if there's a ridge to find where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the seat area, you should insert your dominant finger into the seat.
If you feel that the needle has penetrated to its full length in your finger without touching the skin or flesh between your finger and it, then be sure of this: it is embedded deeply. Do not attempt to remove it as there would be no relief from it, as we have said.
And they said that it can heal in some people occasionally, especially after a treatment that promises benefits. One should apply a thin rod according to the size of the bullet as previously described, and insert it into the bullet until it reaches close to the base, then withdraw it two or three times.
Until you learn that all the excess, congealed flesh resembling a feather tube, has burned. Then treat it with an ointment soaked in oil until those burnt pieces of flesh come out. Then apply the salt-paste balm remedies and if it heals, it is healed.
Otherwise, there is no cure for it by any other means of treatment ever. And if you do insert the needle and it doesn't penetrate to your finger in the socket, but instead has a thick barrier made of flesh or scales between it and the needle, and you see the bullet beneath the skin surface after that, then cut through the skin from the first bullet point onwards. And you pass through the cut with the needle, which is in the bullet, until you reach the end of the cut where the tip of the needle ends. The needle then comes out and falls. Afterwards, clean the excess flesh that resembles a feather tube from it, leaving nothing behind.
Then treat it with salt ointments until it heals. If blood accumulation impedes your ability to cut out that flesh, the best thing you can do for quick relief is either burn it with fire or apply a strong medicine. Burning with fire unites two good effects: burning off that excess flesh.
Stopping the blood flow and draining of moisture, then treating with ointment in fat or powdered sulfur mixed with oil until it purges the area. Then treat the wound with salve produced from hard flesh plants after those burned meats have been discharged in the pus. Finally, treat the injury using remedies on cold meat.
These are the medicines that have constriction and drainage. If they overpower, there is freedom without recurrence, and no return of pain. If the navel has reached the depth of the abdominal cavity and beyond the body surface, insert your finger into the cavity and explore with it.
If you feel the spear and there is a barrier of fat or flesh between you and it, which is close to penetration, then working on it is only through the path of greed and hope. This means using one of three methods; either by reinforcing as we have explained.
Otherwise, you would cut through until you reach its bottom to be able to insert the rod and treat it closely without extending the cut for fear of cutting the surrounding tissue causing spontaneous bowel movement. Then, treat it with what we mentioned which may lead to freedom as we said.
Otherwise, you can penetrate that barrier and pierce it after cutting through to the abdominal cavity as we explained either by using a spear or another sharp tool. Then clean all the burned flesh in the cut down to where you could reach with exploration.
Then seal the wound completely, including the cut and upper mouth until they close. It leaves the navel open inside the cavity making it lighter on the bowels. The navel may stick in this condition.
And it is when you insert the spear into the navel, which is in one part of the abdominal cavity near the body surface beneath the skin and around the belt-like tissue; take then a sharpened-ended spear like a surgical needle as shown here:.
Insert a coiled thread of five threads or somewhat more in, then insert the scalpel with the thread into the socket until it reaches the bottom. If it sinks deeply in the periphery of the seat from inside near.
Then remove the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the socket and pulling out one end of the thread. Gather both ends together, pull them tightly, and leave them for a day or two. Every time the thread cuts through the flesh, pull it tightly until those parts of flesh between the ends of the threads get cut off and fall out. Then treat the wound until it heals.
If the mouth of the socket is not deep, force it out as far as possible, even if this means going quite deep in which case you cannot do anything for fear of cutting the muscle. Then proceed with the rest as we have mentioned until it heals.
The scapular pliers that cut through the sockets have a sharp edge on one side for removal, while the other side is not sharp to avoid cutting unnecessary parts as shown.
Chapter fifty-one and eighty.
In hemorrhoids where blood is dripping, cutting them, and treating fissures.
The hemorrhoids occur in two ways: either they are inside the socket resembling veins of a horse or like raisins from them, being both small and large, with blood constantly dripping from them.
They can occur singly or in abundance, both inside and outside the socket. However, those that are outside the socket are less common with little moisture; they secrete a yellowish water or slightly bloody fluid constantly and have the color of skin.
Treatment that occurs within the hukkam (thorax) involves instructing the patient to urinate and defecate until the hukkam opens up, revealing the contents. When this happens, you should quickly bind them with reed or grasp them with your fingers, then cut at their roots; if the reed does not stick due to moisture and relaxation, it will be easier.
Pull it out with a coarse awl or a piece of sharpened bone, or grasp it with your fingers, then cut it off. After cutting, apply some sharp needles in its place or rub it with what is instructed in the section about knives.
Then treat her with all remedies until she is cured. If the hukkam doesn't allow him to leave, puncture the patient's glans in a hypodermic syringe containing a little cold vinegar and let him wash with it what is inside the hukkam, so he will quickly go out when he starts urinating. If the urine comes out of the hukkam, then order her to do this easily.
It involves grabbing it with your finger or attaching it to a chain and cutting it, then treat her as we mentioned until she is cured. If you dislike cutting with iron, perhaps you should use the dung of the camel in this situation. Take a twisted thread and insert it into an awl.
Then draw the mucus upwards and expel it through an awl at its root from the other side. Wrap both ends of the thread below the needle, which is obstructing it, and pull the mucus tightly. Then tie the thread, leaving one intact not to pierce it.
To cleanse it from blood residues, then place on the hukkam an awl soaked in fat or oil and leave it on the hukkam. Command the patient to rest until it falls down; once it does, treat her with ointments and other treatments until she is cured.
If it comes to treating fissures, it often involves the desiccation of dung and arrest of the imprint. If it has hardened and not healed within, then perhaps a scalpel or your nail should be used to strip it down until it becomes moist and eliminates the outer layer that prevents its healing.
Then treat it until it fully heals, if it does not heal completely then continue with more aggressive stripping than the first until it heals properly and scabs over. Then treat it, for it will be cured.
The Second and Eighty Chapter.
In the treatment of inverted nails, both those that are not inverted, dry pustules, and ants.
Indeed, the nail is merely a twisted knot of tissue that matches the body's color and resembles the head of a nail. It exists throughout the body but particularly in the lower parts of the feet and fingers, causing pain upon walking due to it.
It is necessary to cut around the nail and hold it with a rasp or file, then remove it from its root. After that, treat it as desired following what was explained in the section on nails. As for dry blisters, each of them is a small rough knot twisted and circularly shaped above the body's surface.
Often, it occurs in boys' hands and its treatment involves stretching the thread and cutting it or twisting it with silk thread or a hair thread until it falls off. You may want to burn it as previously explained using fire or an intense medicine.
The inverted and non-inverted blisters can be removed with the instrument I mentioned earlier for treating ants. As for the ants, they are also small, twisted rough bumps on the body that go deep in it. If cold affects them, you'd feel them like being stung by an ant.
Throughout the body, more exists in the hands and its treatment involves taking out a tube from an elephant's hair or a strong eagle's feather. This tube is to be wrapped around the ant until it surrounds the circumference of the tube all around. Then you should move your hand with the tube until it cuts what surrounds the ant.
And make it in the depth of the flesh, the ant will be pulled from its root. If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube like this:
The tip of the tube reaches up to the waist, tied with a string for ease in handling and controlling. If you wish, you can fix the ant as described earlier within the weaving techniques under the chapter on weaving.
The thirty-eighth chapter.
In illustrations of the machines used for injection in cases of constipation, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, or Chinese porcelain, or brass, whether it is drawn or hammered. The size of this instrument, whether small or large, depends on the needs of those who use it. The one used for treating young children would be small, and those whose seats are narrow or constricted have very smooth syringes. Picture of a large syringe:".
The top part that connects the nozzle should be wide on this type, having a barrier where the nozzle is attached as you see. The lower end that enters the seat has a very smooth tube reaching up to the waist, with two holes on one side and one hole on the other side.
The size of the hole is suitable for a harder discharge or slightly softer, and the nozzle where medicines are made from an animal bladder or from a sheep's flesh should be in the shape of a small goblet with its diameter being one cubit.
And pierce many holes as it turns and there is a rough finger thickness between each hole. Then, enter a thin thread from the wool of two tenths of ten threads or close to that amount into those holes. The knotting comes together like a journey. And when the medicine is placed inside, pull firmly on the tip of the syringe between the two stones firmly and closely, then inject it. This is a picture of the knot and hole:.
And the way of administering it is to fill the bladder or the vessel with medicine while it is heated as much as possible and beware that it isn't too hot or too cold. Then, the patient lies on his back and raises his legs upwards.
And it is placed under a pad or a cloth, then the tip of the syringe is greased with oil or egg white or saliva from the inside of the lip, or something similar. Then, it enters into the seat gently. The attendant holds the knot of threads in his hands and squeezes it strongly until all that is in the syringe is discharged into the intestines.
And then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs to the wall. If the medicine prompts him to urinate, he will relieve himself as much as possible. And if he slept through the night, it would be more effective for the treatment. If it was given in cases of diarrhea and it was necessary to hasten its effect, then repeat the injection until he recovers.
And if there are painful tubes or swellings in the seat, make the syringe very soft and smooth compared to those used for children's injections. This is a picture of a gentle syringe bound with its skin:.
The forty-eighth chapter.
In the treatment of surgeries.
You may have mentioned in the section about treating things similar to cauterizations, and I am noting here their treatment by hand and with medication at perfection. I say that surgical wounds vary according to what they are operating on and according to where the wound is located.
The things by which the surgical operations occur are many, such as a rock fracture or a cut with a sword or a knife or an arrow piercing or a spear and so on, these being numerous types of items.
And as for the surgical operations according to body locations, they are those that occur on the head or neck or chest or abdomen and so forth, these being parts of the organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some surgical procedures as a standard and law for all surgeries, starting with simple head operations because the operating table will be mentioned in the initial sections of this book's third chapter.
I say that if a simple head injury occurred without bone fracture and it was caused by a rock or something similar, causing only the skin to be impacted and the wound being large, I feared a hot tumor could occur. In this case, one should promptly apply ice. Don't delay that; remove the blood from him according to its strength if it doesn't prevent the wound from swelling. Especially if the blood flowing out of the wound is slight, swell it on the opposite side of the wounded area.
And warn the patient against full meals, drinks and sticky foods. If it prevents swelling, then reduce food intake; don't get close to meat or drinks. And apply a cloth soaked in rose oil on the wound if a hot tumor appears. Or use that drink with some control.
And if the hot lump is absorbed, bear it on the incision if it is soft by its blood and not altered by the air. I will describe to you later what follows this, but if it has already been altered by the air, bear it on some ointments.
Until the pus discharges and then it is treated until recovery, if the wound is large and from sword cuts or similar injuries where its edges do not meet in stitches, sew it together with my description of stitching wounds on the stomach.
And if the skin is separated from the bone and adheres, but its adhesion was only in a gentle layer underneath, cut it off then treat the wound with medicines that force hardened flesh to replace the skin. Instruct the one who fasts to sustain himself on food that has strength such as the heads of animals or horns and things similar.
And if there is pus in the skin that does not adhere to the bone, cut off all of the infected area and throw it away then treat. If there are arteries or veins bleeding blood from this injury where the blood has not stopped with medicines, search for them.
And if it did not heal when struck, pound it with the tammer and bandage. If necessity demands and what we have mentioned is ineffective, cut until the blood stops flowing. For these small, simple injuries, it's easy and sufficient to treat them by letting them be in contact with this air through their own blood.
Before it is altered by the air, the recipe of 'drows' instructs to take a part from the milk, two parts from the beeswax and three parts from the extinguished or unextinguished tallow. Grind all of them together, sift them and apply this mixture on the wound, pulling firmly with strong tension until it sticks well.
The blood clots then it is tightened from above by the aids and left undisturbed until it does not swell. It will not come off him until the medicine has been relieved, and it can do this with dirt alone if neither milk nor aromatic herbs are available.
This action can also be performed with just two fingers in many major surgeries if he skillfully places them and tightens, and the surgeries are moistened by their blood as long as it hasn't been altered by the air. However, if the air has somewhat altered it, especially during summer time.
There is no practical meaning in placing this kind of paste on the wound as we have mentioned that it can bear some mature ointments or a dough made from flour and mixed with water and honey until the pus drains out. Then, treat it with all other treatments until it heals.
As for if there was a fracture in the wound and it was mild, then bind it with a splint. I mentioned treating minor head fractures before in neck surgery. If the injury is in the neck, there's no difference in treatment between an injury to the head if it was simple.
As for if it severed a nerve or artery from the neck, if it was a nerve there's no trick other than to avoid treating it with things that constrict strongly like pincers and the likes because they harm the nerve and distress it.
No cold thing is placed on the wound because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection with the brain which is the finest organ, and what you treat it with from medicines would be things like washed saffron in fresh water or dipped in oil or rose-wood balm.
If it is also washed with sweet water and other metallic stones in this manner and damp ointments, then if the wound is large use stitching or bring together its edges with ligatures and then treat until it heals.
If the wound has depth and a hidden cavity at the bottom where pus has accumulated, then wash it with the lowest part available. If there is a broken vessel in the wound causing bleeding, then stop the flow by pressing or bandaging, or use clamps if necessary.
If the wound has cut through some parts of the stumps or all of them and removed the ovaries, then sew its skin edges together on the ring canal with stitches. Don't touch the canal itself but stabilize it and return it to its natural shape, then pull tight and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that promote healing and drying until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, then clean it out. If there are bone fragments in the wound, extract them all or what you can reach. If there is anything left, leave it until the wound clears and heals naturally, making its removal easier.
If the wound is soft, sprinkle it with what we described earlier. If the wound heals to form a hard crust, then treat it according to what is described in its section regarding chest surgery and between the shoulders.
If the thrust was from a spear or knife and you find depth in it, observe: if its wind comes out when the patient breathes, know that it is a mortal wound. If there is no depth and it is soft with blood alone, do not apply any remedy at first nor tighten anything for fear of blocking the blood in its depths.
Bring the patient to the heart but make it twice attractive and pour its liquid in the day two times. If Merham (a kind of medicine) does not attract you, put a little cotton in the wound for it to absorb any moisture that comes out from it. Have the ill person sleep on the wound.
Don't consider what gathers there, and even if three days or more have passed since the wound and there was no contraction, bad rhythm, or difficulty in breathing, and you see that all his conditions are fine, then know that the wound is healthy. Treat it with sutures and all other treatments until it heals.
If it is impossible to see him and if the pulse remains always, then know that he has become a scar. The ill person on the wound should not consider what gathers there. If three days or more have passed since the wound in the chest or back, treat him with advanced stitches.
If it is large or necessarily if it is small, if it has affected the bone and removed fragments from it, inspect the wound and promptly remove those fragments if they are clean. If they are not clean, leave them alone until.
Clean the wound, as it facilitates their removal. As for other acute injuries to all organs, they are treated according to what we have mentioned.
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
In surgeries of the abdomen, removal of viscera and their缝合.
The perforation affecting the abdomen can be large, small or medium. The larger one might release internal organs or several intestines making its insertion and缝合 more difficult and harder.
The small perforation could also complicate from another aspect, it needs that returning it would be harder. If the viscera doesn't prompt to put him back into his place in time, it swells and becomes hard making it harder to return it. That's why the medium perforations are better than these two types because they don't make it difficult for returning the viscera as these two types do.
Know that sewing of the abdomen is on four sides. The two general stitches are suitable for abdominal sewing and for other surgeries in the body, while the other two special stitches apply to all surgeries except they are most specific for abdominal stitching.
And I will describe it to you one by one with explanation and statement. So, if the wound is small and something of the contents comes out and it is difficult to return, this occurs for two reasons: either due to the smallness of the tear as we said or because the contents had been inflated in advance by the cold air.
If that's the case, it should be treated by warming up with a wet sponge or a small hole immersed in hot water alone or cooked in it along with thyme and basil. The contents should be soaked until the inflation dissolves.
And it can be done with the drink that has a digestive effect which is better than water alone in dissolving inflation. When you see the inflation has dissolved, cleanse the contents using water boiled with mint or baker's ingredients. The contents will then pass smoothly due to this action.
If return of the contents does not occur after this treatment, then make a small incision with the needle that is used to puncture the flesh. The initial treatment works better than making an incision, and one must resort to making an incision only out of necessity when all other methods fail. This is what the instrument looks like:
One of its ends is curved and limited while the other end is unlimited. The delicate tip should not be sharp like a knife but rather slightly blunt. It resembles a small soldering iron as you see it. If the wound widens and the contents enter, then returning them should happen in their natural shape.
If you are able to do it in its proper place, that is better. However, if the incision is wide and located at the bottom of the abdomen, it should be advisable for the patient to lie on their back with their legs higher than their head. If it's located at the top of the abdomen, then their head and chest should be higher than the bottom part of their body.
And similarly, if the incision is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, always make your purpose and intention that the area with the operation be higher than the other side. This way, it should be used in great surgeries and in medium-sized ones.
And in minor surgeries, place him as your ability allows. Then have by your side a servant companion who holds the entire incision with his hands and closes his lips. Then he reveals to those sewing stitch after stitch.
This is the characteristic of ordinary sewing which is, you take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound. Then you leave at each edge of the incision an amount equal to the thickness of the thread. You then pierce one needle without inserting any string in its edges of skin. With the edges of the skin that are under the skin from inside, until you pierce it from this side. I have gathered my skin margins and pleural margins resulting in four threads. Then, draw a double string around the needle in both sides repeatedly until the incision edges meet tightly.
Then, leaving an amount equal to the thickness of a finger, you pierce another needle and tie it with the string in the same way as the first needle. You continue this process with needles as needed until all parts of the incision are sewn up. The needles should be medium-thickness between hardness and softness.
Because the thin needles cut through flesh and cartilage very quickly, making it hard to enter the skin. Therefore, a needle should be used that is both firm and flexible in texture. It is not recommended to insert the needle too close to the edge of the skin.
So that the flesh does not cut too quickly and the wound does not open before healing, nor is it also separated by sewing so as not to prevent the wound from healing. Then trim the ends of the needles so they do not harm the patient when sleeping and provide him with gauze wicks from each side that hold the needle ends.
And leave it until you learn that the wound has healed, and this kind of sewing with needles is thus more suitable for minor surgeries as it may suffice in stitching with one or two needles or around that.
Or, the stitch for the second commoner is that you gather the four edges together meaning the edges of the skin and the edges of the wound in one go with a needle containing a twisted thread that is moderate in firmness and flexibility. Then, after pulling out these four edges with this needle, I repeated the needle from the same side where it started itself.
The thread should be tangled from above the wound, making the stitch according to the way it's tightened with the reins, leaving a small gap between each stitch and every stitch after tightening the little finger. This kind of stitching is known by everyone.
With this type of stitch, I performed surgery on a man who had been stabbed in his stomach. The wound was more than a yard long and he lost about two yards of middle intestine from it. The wound was in the center of the abdomen.
I repeated the stitching after he had lost his intestines outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed within about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered and lived many years after that, leading a normal life. The doctors judged that he would never recover completely.
It is indeed surprising that I did not cure him with my lotion, as there was no medicine available where I was. I used to place used cotton on the wound twice a day and promised washing it with honey water until he recovered.
And as for the two types of specialized stitching, I recall from Galen's words that you should start stitching from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside. When the needle enters the skin and the muscle belly in alignment with the abdomen throughout its entire length.
The wound in the scrotum on the side where the needle was inserted, extends to that edge of the wound. Then, I pierce the other edge of its opening from inside to outside within the other tract. When it has passed through, I puncture it again from this same opening from outside to inside.
And leave the wound of the scrotum on this side and insert the needle in its other edge from inside to outside. And as you pierce it through, push into the opening of the prostate gland on its side until all of them penetrate.
Then also start from the same side and align it with the wound of the scrotum on the other side, then pull out the needle from the skin close to it. Then return it into that skin and align the edge of the scrotum wound on the other side together with this opening of the prostate.
Then pull it out from the skin on its side. Do this again and again, doing it repeatedly until you have sewn the entire operation according to that example. The characteristic feature of this stitching is that it resembles the stitches made by herders for their sheep.
It involves sewing the scrotum once on one side with the edge of the skin and then leaving it from the other side until completion. As for the second type of specialized stitching mentioned by Galen, this is his word in writing.
It consists in suturing it according to what the healers' tribes do, by bringing together each part to its similar counterpart. They incorporate the pleural cavity edge to its other side and the pericardial cavity edge to its other side. This will be as described for you.
The needle should be inserted into the vicinity of the mucus membrane near you from outside and penetrate it alone to inside. Then leave its edge close to the pleura. Return the needle then penetrate it from outside to inside in the edge of the pleura for both of them. Then also return it.
And you should penetrate it from inside to outside in the other edge of the mucus membrane on the opposite side, this kind of stitching is better than easy and common simple sewing which was mentioned before. This is Galen's exact words, and some people say that belly stitching could be done with two needles. That is, to insert a single thread into both of them. Start by inserting the needle from here and take it to the other side, then put in the second needle from the opposite side and guide it as you would when sewing the eyelid.
And know that if the perforation is in the middle of the abdomen, its stitching is harder than that of other parts of the abdomen. As for healing the wound, it follows the rules of healing all injuries. This means when you pinch the wound while it's filled with blood before the air changes it and after pressing and sewing it properly, then the putrid matter should be removed from it.
And if the wound has been changed by air, let there be some ointments that are prescribed for it until it vomits and removes the threads, unites the pleura and the pericardium. Then treat it as you do with other wounds until it heals.
If remedies are not available, apply treatment by having him start with the removal of old cotton wads and change them twice a day as you were taught until he recovers. Normally, no other treatment is required under most circumstances if surgeries are simple; I fear that the wound may involve experiencing pain in the main organs along with it.
You should soak our cotton in medium heated oil or rose butter, and put it around the areas between the ribs and the belly. If he feels pain or irritation in his stomach, this happens frequently, he should drink a strong, fuming black tea to alleviate it.
Especially if the irritation has reached his stomach and turned into an open wound within it. And know that if what came from the intestines was thick, recovery is easier; and if it was thin, then recovery is more difficult.
As for the intestine of a fasting person, it does not accept recovery from surgeries that occur within it because of its numerous blood vessels and bones, its weakness in structure, its closeness to nervous tissue nature. And as for if what came out of the wound was a small hole and it got infected gently, return it according to your return of your intestine, whether it is appropriate or not.
If time has passed and it has turned green or black, it is necessary to tighten a thread above the area that turned black so as not to allow blood leakage. There are blood vessels and arteries in the hole, then cut what is below this ligature.
And make both ends of the thread attached from below inside the surgery so that it will be easier for you to pull and remove it when the hole falls out during cauterization. Remember the wound that occurs in the intestine, but if a tear occurred in the intestine and it was small.
If it may force some people in order that I saw a man who had pricked inside his belly with an arrow and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, I would measure the wound and it became a stench that excretes from it feces and air. So I raised him thinking not to hope for his recovery. I continued to nurse him until he recovered and the wound healed, but upon seeing that the place had healed, I feared for his safety thinking something might happen to him inside, so I did not allow any harm or misfortune to befall him. He remained in his best condition. He is healthy, eating and drinking, engaging in sexual activity, entering the bathroom and taking care of himself. Some experienced people have mentioned that if a wound occurred during pregnancy and it was small, it should be treated according to this characteristic.
It involves taking larger ants, placing their heads on the wound, then bringing their jaws together and laying one of them with its mouth open on the wound. When it grasps it and tightens its mouth, it cuts off its head; it sticks but does not come apart, then another ant is placed near the first one.
Continue doing it with several ants according to the size of the wound, then press and stitch the wound. These heads remain stuck inside the abdomen until the intestine heals and recovers completely; no harm will happen to the patient as long as this process doesn't cause any obstruction. The intestine can also be stitched using a fine thread.
The one who pulls out the adhesive animal from Egypt, which is when you take the end of this thread from the animal and pull it gently, then tie a fine, rolled cotton thread to its end. Then, you insert that thread into the needle. In it, thread is inserted in the intestines and then returned to the belly cavity. This method of sewing with beeswax and string is only for those who are greedy and hopeful.
And if the puncture is large and widespread, especially if it's in one of the small intestines, there's no trick or way out at all.
The sixtieth chapter.
In the treatment of the sore throat and the swallowing disorder.
Be aware that every wound or tumor, if it becomes chronic and degenerates into a sore without healing, continues to produce pus constantly without interruption. This is called phlegmonous in all body parts. When we refer to this specifically in the throat area, we call it a sore throat and swallowing disorder.
It is indeed a complex, intertwined solid white mass without pain, having a cavity similar to the cavity of a bird's feather.
That's why some refer to it as a 'feather', and at times, it can be wet with constant production of pus. At other times, the wetness may stop for periods. The amount of this wetness can vary, sometimes being abundant, sometimes scarce, thick or thin.
And in the section discussing surgeries, it was mentioned that every wound that does not heal and has no growth of flesh within it could be due to one of nine reasons. One reason might be a lack of blood in the body, or perhaps blood congestion, or there might be hard flesh inside it or at its edges preventing the growth of good flesh. And it might be because of too much pus and filth, or perhaps the wound itself is infected with bad materials flowing from it. It could also be due to inappropriate medication in treating it, or infection caused by an outbreak similar to bubonic plague within the community, or it could have a specific characteristic related to that.
And it might be because of too much pus and filth, or perhaps the wound itself is infected with bad materials flowing from it. It could also be due to inappropriate medication in treating it, or infection caused by an outbreak similar to bubonic plague within the community, or it could have a specific characteristic related to that. The passage discusses the city of Saragossa, a place where the maturation of illnesses is difficult and tumor healing slows down naturally. It could be due to having one bone or several bones within it. All these causes, their signs, and treatments using medications have been shown in this section.
I must inform you here about the treatment of scabies and indigestion, which works through hand practice. Know that scabies can occur in all body parts; some end up in large arteries and veins or nerves.
Or to the chest, or to the stomach, or to the bladder, or to a rib of the ribs, or to a joint in the complex joints such as the hand and foot. And some can lead to near an important organ and so on.
If these scabies are in this manner, then they are easy diseases to heal that don't accept treatment and making efforts on them is hard work and ignorance. If it's concerning the scabies that have not reached the mentioned locations and you were hoping for and longing for their cure.
And if you want to understand this, take a metal pick, like one made of copper or iron. If the scabies runs straight, scratch it with the pick. But if there's curvature in the scabies, use a thin lead pick instead. The lead will smoothly conform to its shape.
It becomes smooth when entering and curves towards the curvature. If the scabies has many openings which cannot be detected with a pick, insert one mouth from its openings. The moisture that you fill it with will flow towards the other openings and drain out.
From there, inspect the examination in any way possible to determine if there is a bone or nerve. Or was the scabies deep or close inside. Or whether it's one scabies with many openings. Try your utmost strength from finding out its location by sensing any pain when you touch the area.
This is how the indications and causes for tumors manifest, once you stand on all this truthfully, then one should proceed to treatment with certainty. It involves examining if it's clear.
The treatment is observable soon or in a safe position away from a joint, nerve, artery, vein or any of the places you were informed about. The process involves cutting the affected area based on the previous description and removing all the impurities and excess flesh.
What grows in his mouth like flesh or cavities and such, correct his treatment until he heals. If the affected area is deep but straight, it would be advisable to cut deeply as much as you can, then clean it thoroughly of all rotten flesh.
Then use the processed garlic in strong remedies, insert it into the depth of the affected area that you reach with iron. Do this multiple times until that strong medicine eats up all the remaining decay inside the affected area.
Then force him with the ointments that promote healthy growth until he heals. If he doesn't heal, then cut and treat him as previously described. If the cause of the tumor is bone and you find it appropriate, dig and cut it according to what I've informed you, if there's no hindrance preventing you.
Or a nerve or a major body part as we said, if you uncovered the bone and found some decay and darkness in it, remove it until his rottenness disappears. Then treat him with what stimulates growth until he heals, if he doesn't heal and continues discharging phlegm like before.
Remember that you haven't reached the removal of all decay yet. Examine everything else on him again, thoroughly remove and clean it with your utmost effort then force him. If he heals, otherwise know that this decay is far from existing decay, so examine everything else again.
Probe and clean the diseased bone with your utmost effort; it was a small decayed bone that could be pulled out, so pull it using the soft ligaments suitable for this purpose.
If there are many bones, probe and pull out all of them without leaving any behind. With your utmost effort, if anything from the ligaments obstructs you and it is not dangerous in its piece, cut those ligaments and flesh if they exist and clear the bones.
If you do not have the time to remove the bones, cover the wound with what cleans it and leave it for days until it discharges from around those bones and flesh and ligaments. Keep the wound open so that the cut made during your work does not heal.
But if you fear that, place on it a cloth dipped in powdered sulfur and oil or a cloth dipped in Egyptian kohl or one of the green ointments. When those ligaments have discharged and the bones have softened, it will be easier to pull them out and remove them.
If it is a large bone, like the thigh bone or others, and only its outer surface was decayed, then strip it completely clean until that blackness and corruption disappear. Then force the wound open. If a large part of it had rotted and corruption had reached inside the bone, then it will be necessary to remove it.
And cut it all until the end of the decay. Then let him heal until he is whole again, I am telling you about this as an example and aid for your treatment that was presented to a man in his leg. This person grew old.
By about thirty years old, he was suffering pain in his leg from a movement inside the body that caused substances to reach the leg and swelling. He had an enormous bone, which was not due to something external. Then time passed with medical errors until the tumor opened.
A large number of materials were derived from it, and they were poorly treated in its healing that the leg became swollen and numerous mouths formed throughout which pus and bodily moisture drained. A group of doctors worked on this for about two years, and among them was no one skilled in handcraft.
Until then, when he looked at the leg and materials were seeping from those mouths like a great stream, the leg had swollen and its body color had turned yellow. Therefore, I inserted the probe into one of those mouths, which led to the bone through it. Then, I cauterized all the mouth openings.
I found that some of them led to each other from all directions on the leg, so I pierced into one of those mouths until I revealed part of the bone. I found it corroded, blackened and rotten, and full of pus and debris, until I was able to penetrate the hole to the marrow, spreading what I discovered.
He was able to remove the corroded bone, thinking that there was no other decay in the bone, spreading and applying medicinal salt for a longer period of time after he had cut it out. But it did not heal. I then looked again and found evidence of further decay on the bone above the first discovery.
I found the decay connected to the bone, spreading what I had also noticed of that decay. Then I insisted on treating it but it neither healed nor closed properly, so I looked at it again and continued cutting out part of the bone piece by piece while applying treatment for healing, yet it did not heal until I cut off about a handbreadth of the bone.
I removed it with its marrow and treated it with medicines, which healed quickly and made him well. This repetition in his operation and cuts was necessary due to the weakness of the patient's condition, low tolerance, and my fear for his death as he had experienced excessive excretion that led to bad results continuously. I cured him completely from this disease.
In a place where the bone has hardened and improved in its body, reduced its strength, regulated its conditions, did not subject it to an illness that would fundamentally harm him when walking, if the bone had broken at a position in the body.
You should apply this method which involves taking a band and tightening it at the end of the broken bone, instruct someone to hold it upwards, then apply another band made from thicker wool than the first one.
Then, you bind it to the flesh underneath the bone and extend its end so that it pulls the flesh downwards as you lift the flesh away from the position you want to spread it for fear of injuring the meat. Then place a plank or a board firmly under the bone from below.
Because if you do this, the saw will not prevent cutting off the rotten bone. It should be necessary for spreading to be slightly above the diseased area so that there is no decay in the cavity of the bone which would not be visible on the surface, forcing you to spread it again.
If the bone is rotten and it's not a fracture but some parts are connected to each other with decay in the middle or in some parts, lift the flesh from all its sides then place the plank from below then spread it from the first side where decay exists.
When you finish spreading on one side, spread it from the other side as well. Let the spreading be slightly away from the decay as we said. If there is decay in a joint, cut off the decayed section of the joint itself and spread the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the decay is in the connection of two joints, there's no trick other than amputation. If the decay is inside the wrist or ankle joint, treating it is extremely difficult but you should peel off the decay as much as visible and remove it and clean it to whatever extent you can.
With what trick do you straighten it when the sweat or nerve does not oppose you, and know that the cuts and grooves for these bones are numerous according to the position of the bones, their orientation, their hardness, their texture, their size, their smallness, and their brittleness. For this reason, it is necessary to prepare for each type of work an apparatus for grinding that work.
And know that the works themselves can guide you to the type of machine you need if you have a long road and knowledge of the arts of this trade because proficiency in the trade and seeing examples of diseases is. Thus, he can derive for himself what suits him of machines for every disease. I will show you several machines in this chapter.

Chapter seventy-eight.
In amputations and spreading bones.
Limbs may rot either from a cause outside or from a cause inside. If the decay is treated with medical remedies and they don't work, and you see the decay advancing in the member without anything deterring it.
It is necessary to cut off that part up to where the decay has reached, so that he dies of this or from a great suffering greater than losing the member. A sign of someone who might undergo such treatment is when you think the limb has been burned by fire.
Or may rot after the blackness until this decay advances to what follows that limb and spreads throughout the body as a whole; in which case, you should promptly cut it off. Similarly, if the cause of decay is due to being bitten by some insects like sea snakes or snakes or leeches and so on.
If the decay or ulcer is in a finger, cut off the finger and don't let the decay spread to the hand. Likewise, if it spreads into the hand, cut it off at the wrist joint and don't let the decay progress until it reaches the elbow bone.
And similarly, if it is taken in the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow joint itself, if the infection has spread and was seen to extend as far as the knee, do not cut off the knee alone; for there lies death in that. Rather, use other remedies according to capability.
And similarly, if it is taken in the toe and infection has occurred in it, cut off the toe at one of the joints. If the infection gets to the sole of the foot, then cut off the whole foot. If it advances upwards till the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
And if the infection has reached above the knee, there is no remedy other than leaving it and allowing the diseased limb to die. The prescription for cutting off or spreading an infected area involves tying a bandage below the place you want to cut and another one above the place.
The attendant stretches the lower band to below and the other band of the ribbon upwards. You then remove the flesh between the two bands with a wide scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then cut or spread it. It should be punctured with cotton thread from all directions.
In order to avoid the blade touching the correct spot and causing unnecessary pain and hot inflammation, if there is bleeding during your work, cover the area quickly or hold it with some blood-stopping wads. Then resume your treatment until you finish.
Then, tie the injured limb with a bandage suitable for it and treat it until it heals. I will tell you an example of this treatment that involves someone suffering from this specific condition in one foot which I am describing to you. It happened that there was a blackness in his leg resembling fire burns.
That infection was the first occurrence in his toe, until he began experiencing symptoms throughout his entire foot. Seeing that the disease was spreading with intense pain and burning sensations throughout his limb, he cut it off at the joint when he noticed the infection reaching to the body of the limb. He then recovered.
Upon passage of a long time, he presented that corruption in his ring finger to me. He used the advantage by applying medications on it after cleaning his body from within using what was in his hands, but the benefit did not deter and kept striving in the other finger.
Until the corruption spread in his hand, he called me to cut off his hand. I declined his request and tried my best not to hinder that benefit, also fearing for his life when cutting off his hand due to the weakness of men during such times. Having lost hope, he returned to his homeland.
I heard that he amputated his entire hand and was saved. I tell this story to be a guide in cases of such diseases, to serve as evidence by which one can act accordingly.
The eighty-first chapter.
In the treatment of abscesses and how to administer medications into them.
If a tumor occurs in some meaty organs and the duration of the tumor extends to the point where it accumulates for a long time, then it might burst or rupture, and all that was inside from the duration comes out, leaving the place empty as if it were a vase.
The skin on it is like a breach, having become hollow and not very deep in corruption that it does not affect the bone or nerve or ligament. For this reason, it deserves to be called an abscess rather than a tumor, unless its duration extends until it affects something of these organs due to corruption.
In that case, it is called a tumor or a pustule. Its treatment involves cutting all of that skin as it turns around, especially if it has become hollow like a breach and you are certain that it does not stick to the site due to its corruption.
If you hope for the skin to adhere and it has not reached that degree of corruption, there is a thick layer of flesh in the skin; then puncture it. This involves looking at the cavity if it's large and the pus coming out of it smelling bad; treat it with Egyptian medicine.
That is a mixture of wormwood, oil, honey and ginger. They are to be gathered together in a pot and cooked on fire until the medicine thickens and becomes as dense as honey. Then take some for your need and mix it with water, honey; apply this medicated liquid into the cavity and seal its mouth with it. Leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then press out the squeezed liquid from it for several days until the cavity is cleaned and the pus disappears. You can inject water from wood ashes if this medicine isn't available, which involves taking the burnt wood of almond or beech tree and pouring water on it.
Then, when ready, inject it until you confirm that the cavity is clean. If there's no discharge, there's a possibility to use Egyptian medicine or water from wood ashes. However, if none of these are available, you can inject with water mixed with honey, into which some powdered ginger has been added.
Or inject it with honey and wine mixed together, because the honey purifies and washes away dirt while the wine makes the cavity adhere. Especially if the wine has a strong concentration that dries up, then after doing this several times and confirming that the cavity has eliminated its corruption, you should inject into it what grows out of the flesh.
Like when you take the mastic balsam, you dissolve it with rose oil and a concentrated wine or inject some other ointments and remedies we have proven their properties in the article on ointments. If the cavity's mouth is narrow and cannot fit the catheter tip.
Expand it slightly with iron or insert a thin, twisted piece into the Egyptian mercury or the Sreachon's ointment until it expands. Also, if the mouth is also wide, sew its lips together and leave some of it so that no more than what goes inside the injector remains.
And if his throat, from which the phlegm flows, is elevated up high, split it at its lowest point where the phlegm can flow downwards. Because when phlegm gets blocked in the hollow of the hiding place, it prevents the flesh from growing there.
And if you cannot cut the hollow downwards as much as desired, then make it erect so that the phlegm can easily flow out of it according to what becomes available for you. Do not leave any part of the phlegm in it permanently.
As for the surgical plasters that are placed on the hollow from outside and how to place them, you should take one of the problematic salt ointments as desired and spread it on a cotton wick. Let the size of the wick be such that it completely covers the entire hollow area. Then, with the scissors, make a cut in front of the hollow's mouth slightly larger than the hollow's mouth. Then, apply some soft ointment on another wick to cover the size of the cut and place it on top of the hollow without touching the mouth of the hollow. This helps phlegm flow out easily from it. Do not remove the large wick until after.
For a few days, as for the plaster on the hollow's mouth, it is removed at all times to allow whatever accumulated phlegm to come out and to determine whether the discharges are abundant or little, ripe or not ripe.
And yet, also examine the place of the hollow itself; does its owner feel pain there or not? And is there a lump or not. If your treatment progresses like this and you see that only a small amount comes out through the mouth of the hollow.
Know that if the scab has adhered or is about to adhere, then on the second day or within the third day, resolve it. And when the wound has healed, substitute the hole with another and renew the ointment; if a thin pus comes out of the scab after a long period, do not despair of its coagulation.
Know that healing time varies among people; some have slower tissue regeneration in their wounds, while others have the opposite. If a watery pus comes out from the scab after many days, it means that the scab has not adhered yet. If the scab's coagulation is delayed, understand that it is not properly stuck to the wound.
As time goes on, increase the drying of the medicines. Let these medicines have a consistency that is moist in nature and dry in strength; for example, like powdered camphor which becomes more effective with the addition of more ambergris. Among the most effective remedies is to take powdered camphor.
It is treated with a balsam and aloe, then dusted with moderately aged old wine. Then it is kneaded and used, and this act may be done if powdered camphor has not been mixed with honey until it is steamed to the point where it becomes thick enough and then used or taken from myrrh, saffron and cumin which are all ground together and left over the heat on a stove with honey. Then it is applied to a scrape and the scab is tightened on it, or it is applied with the honeyed sugar until it thickens, then the medicines are sprinkled on it and the scrape is placed on it and tightened.
Corded wool, the long stamen of the sesame plant, ground poppy seed, and ground borage are used individually or mixed together after being crushed, sifted, and left to rest on the described honey. If the scab fails to heal with this treatment and if it remains for a longer time than expected, understand that there is corruption in its root.
And it affects bones or other hard nerves or ligaments, treating the treatment of nails according to what has been mentioned.
The ninety-eighth chapter.
In treating the inflamed testicle and inguinal hernia, suture of the foreskin, amputation of the extra finger, and incision to separate the fingers.
The dahras is flesh that grows abundantly under the big toe nail of the hand or foot, and it may grow in other fingers as well. If it becomes serious and its treatment is neglected, it inflames and becomes hot.
Or the foreskin becomes diseased until it eats away at the nail bed, and may even destroy it completely. Sometimes this disease reaches the bone causing a foul odor to be emitted from it. The tip of the finger will become broad in shape with a color like old metal. If you treat it as described in the previous section and your treatment does not relieve its symptoms.
It is necessary to cut off with iron all the growth that emerges from the nail, then dress the wound afterwards. Cutting in this case is indeed very useful. And if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy.
The concave angle of the nail had pushed the flesh inside and made it rot and smell, it is necessary to place a thin suture under the concave part of the nail that pushes the flesh inward, lift it upwards, and gently cut that rotten flesh.
You should apply on the remaining flesh, burned medicines until it disappears completely. Then treat it with ointments until it heals. And if decay has affected the bone, you must cut that bone out from its root, for there will be no healing as long as it is embedded in rotten bone.
If I see that the decay and corruption are advancing in the finger, cut it off at one of the rings as previously described. Then treat it until it heals. If a nail or bone is hit by the sword or experiences severe pain within it, it may be necessary to remove the infected part first.
Then cut the nail with a sharp plier diagonally, making a slanted cut from top to bottom. Be careful not to reach into the flesh under the nail; doing so can cause severe pain and lead to excessive growth of additional flesh at the site. Then treat the area with remedies that alleviate pain.
And as for the extra finger that is born in some people's hands, it might be all flesh. It could also be partly bone or have a nail. In some of them, there might grow back flesh at the base of one of the joints of certain fingers.
Or, it may grow back in some of the rings on the finger. In others that grow near a joint of the finger, they do not move. If there is bone in them, you would remove it by making it easier; this means cutting it off at its base with a wide plier.
And as for the one that grows at the base of the joint, treating it is difficult; you would have to dismember her rather than cut her. As for the one that grows in the finger near a ring, it may be necessary to first cut out its flesh straight down to the bone. Then spread out the bone with one of those pliers appropriate for this.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the conglomeration that appears among some fingers, this happens frequently and is something humans produce. It occurs at the end of a wound or burn from fire and such incidents; it may be necessary to cut through this conglomerate.
Until the fingers return to their natural state, then place between them a twig or splinter dipped in rose oil so that it does not adhere quickly and separates between them or places a thin sheet of lead between them until the area heals as desired.
And similarly, if the healing of some fingers on the back of the hand is exposed, cut that healing according to what becomes ready and suitable for the shape of the limb.
The ninety-first chapter.
In severing the tendons.
The tendons are curved, bony grooves filled with dark fatty matter that occur in most body parts, and more so in the legs. First, it is advisable to use vigorous fumigation of the black sweat several times.
Then cut off its basilius, and as for treating it with iron, there are two ways: one is to cut through and remove the black blood and its face, the other is to sweat with it and remove it all together. As for cutting, you would first soak the leg with hot water yes.
Until the thick, viscous blood dissolves. Then lift the leg of the patient from above the thigh down to his knee with a cloth. Then sweat in one place or in two or three wide cuts.
Then, with your hand, sweat out the black blood from the bottom of the leg to the top and from the top to the bottom until you have sweated out as much blood as you consider sufficient or that can withstand the strength of the patient. Then bind him and order him to avoid foods that produce black sweat and repeat the sweating and cutting process.
When the veins are full and it harms the patient, but if he sweats, his appearance will be like this; when he has a lot of hair on him, then take a bath and let his leg soak in hot water until it turns red and starts to sweat. Or else if he exercises vigorously.
If he does not take a bath until the member heats up, then the skin splits lengthwise either at its end at the knee or at the bottom at the ankle. Then the skin opens along the canals and the sweat is removed from every side until it becomes visible to touch.
When it appears, you see it red. Once he is freed from the skin, you see that it resembles a tendon. Then insert into it gently until when it rises and leaves the skin, it hangs by a dark smooth thread, then make another cut close to this one with the width of three fingers.
Then remove the skin over the sweat so that it appears. Lift it with your fingers as you did before and hang it on another thread, just like the first time. Then make another cut or several cuts if needed.
Then clean it and cut it at the end of the incision near the ankle. Pull and clean it until it comes out through the second incision, then pull it towards the incision above. Do this until you pull it from the third incision from all previous incisions, when everything has come out, then cut it.
If it does not respond to pulling and cleaning, insert a needle with strong thread that is folded in half and tie it. Pull it, then insert it under your fingers and wipe your hand towards every direction until it comes out, remember not to let it break. If it breaks, it will make cleaning very difficult for you indeed.
A stoma is made on the patient. If it is completely opened, place wool soaked in a drink and grease or oil at the site of the wounds. Cure until recovery happens. If the uterus is distended and irregular with contractions that move to directions.
And it was not straight as we said, it should be cut at each direction and points of its contractions then attached to the pipes so that it can be cleaned by all. When you are cutting it, make sure not to cut or hurt the sweat; if you do, it will make opening harder for you, so be cautious in your effort.
Image of the passage through which the uterus is pierced:.
Image of the blind suture:.
It should not have plating like other pipes and its edge should not be sharp in order to avoid cutting the sweat. It should be thick for bending but smooth, as if it breaks the sweat with its thickness, then it would have a preference of being thick according to what we said.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
In opening the sweat ducts of the civilian.
This sweat is produced in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and Arab countries, and in other hot arid regions, and it might be produced elsewhere in the body apart from the legs. It results from infection that occurs under the skin.
It also occurs within living organisms, maggots, lice and mites, between the skin and muscle, and a sign of this sweat's beginning is when there is intense reddening in the leg followed by the area becoming inflamed. Then the process starts where sweat begins to come out from that point of inflammation.
As if it is a plant or an animal, when one of its parts appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead whose weight ranges from one dirham to two dirhams and then tied up leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
And every time something emerges outside, wrap it in lead and tie it. If the duration is long, cut off some of it and wrap the rest, but don't cut it from its source until all of it has emerged because if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh causing pus to form and a bad wound at the site.
Therefore, it should be gently moved and pulled little by little until it exits from the last part of it and nothing remains in the body. This discharge may come out from some people as long as five fingers or ten.
I have heard that for a man, it has come out as twenty cubits long. If it breaks during treatment, insert a probe into its hole and push it deeply inside the body until all the substance within it is discharged. Try to cover the area with medications for days.
Then treat it with tumor remedies. This discharge may have many branches, especially if it appears in the ankle or itself, causing multiple mouths and each mouth has a branch that is treated as we mentioned in the section and as previously explained.
The Second and Ninety-first Chapter.
In the cut made on the worm that is generated under the tongue, it is called the cow's reason.
This disease is called "the cow's reason" in some of our countries because it happens often with cows, and it is a small worm that generates between the skin and the flesh and moves throughout the whole body both upward and downward.
The sensation of touch when touching one body part to another until it penetrates where it did not in the skin, then exits and forms a pus pocket as some mixtures get infected like what occurs with maggots and worm larvae inside the belly.
It is anticipated that her injury, if it spreads within the body and rises to the head causing damage to the eye, might open up there and cause its contents to spill out, thereby rendering the eye ineffective. This situation occurs frequently. If you wish to treat and remove it, this can be done when it appears externally due to touch sensation.
You should tie above and below it with a strong tourniquet, then cut into it and remove what is within. If it has sunk into the flesh and you can't find it, apply heat to the area where there's fire until it burns off, and expect that it might damage the eye as we've said.
If you see that it has become near the eye in the head, tie below under the cheek with a strong tourniquet then cut into it and remove what is inside. It should be agreed that the patient must cleanse his body using medications that facilitate the expulsion of bad pus-filled mixtures, and avoid food that can cause infection.
The ninety-first chapter.
In the section on the illness known as nafar (pus-filled).
This disease, which in our region is called nafar, is a pain that appears in some organs and then spreads from one organ to another. I have seen it as described to you.
I was called to see an ill woman in some desert areas. I exposed her arm and found a slight puffiness under the skin of her elbow artery, which after an hour, I saw that puffiness began to spread like a worm ascending along with the vein at the fastest speed imaginable, as fast as lead.
If it moves from one place to another, the pain leaves that area and settles in the buttocks. Then after an hour, its movement spreads throughout the body until it reaches the other arm. She also told me that her entire body rotates as I observed.
I was amazed by the speed of its transfer from one limb to another. I had not seen this disease in such a manner before, except when I observed a group experiencing pain moving from one part to another, but I did not see it as clearly as I saw it in this woman.
I did not realize it could be due to the woman being from the desert people, whose bodies were exposed and dry. This explains why I was able to feel this moving wind on her skin. It would not have been the same for those of comfortable lifestyle with hidden and moist skin.
If you want to treat him and the sufferer feels pain, as we have described, then it will appear clearly before your eyes. Clutch over and under him with the wheel and make cuts until that trapped wind comes out, cleaning the area.
If you do not see it with your eyes, treat him by body cleansing and using substances that disperse winds like the product of fermentation, the secretion of the urine bladder, and similar medicines.
The forty-ninth chapter, fourth section.
In removing arrows.
Arrows can vary depending on their types and where they are located in the body. As for their variation according to their types, some of them are large and small, others are glass bulbous, and others are glass engraved. Some have three angles and four angles.
Others have tongues and others have fragments. As for those that occur according to the body parts they are located in, there are two types: either the organs are from major hollow organs like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, stomach, bladder, etc. When a dart has struck one of these organs and you have noticed the signs of death which I am about to describe, it should be avoided for extraction. For in most cases, death would befall its owner. And when you do not notice these bad signs and the dart has not disappeared within the depth of the organ, remove it and treat the wound. As for symptoms of the brain if struck by a dart and the bone is penetrated causing injury to the membrane over the brain, one is exposed to severe headache, nausea and dizziness.
And when you do not notice these bad signs and the dart has not disappeared within the depth of the organ, remove it and treat the wound. As for symptoms of the brain if struck by a dart and the bone is penetrated causing injury to the membrane over the brain, one is exposed to severe headache, nausea and dizziness. And redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, cramps and confusion, vomiting once or perhaps blood came out from the nostrils or ears. Perhaps speech was lost and sound went away. A white moisture appeared that resembles dough, which flows like meat juice from the place of injury.
And when these symptoms appear, refrain from treating the wound and removing the dart if it has not yet come out. If the dart hit the heart and was close to the left breast, feel as though it is embedded in something solid rather than empty.
And perhaps the dart moves like a heartbeat and blood flows from the wound, black. Following this, there will be a loss of body functions, cold sweat, and fainting. Understand that death is inevitable in such cases. If the dart wounds the lung, blood with a greasy consistency will come out from the wound.
The veins in the neck may swell and change the color of the wound. He breathes with a loud noise, seeking to inhale cold air. If the dart hits the diaphragm in the chest, it will be close to the small ribs, accompanied by heavy breathing and intense pain.
All members of the clavicles vibrate and move, if the arrow hits the liver it follows this with severe pain and blood comes out of the wound that resembles liver in its hue. If the arrow hits the stomach, there may be something not well digested coming out of the wound from the food.
It is clear for him, if the arrow hits the abdomen and there is a disturbance there, and something from feces comes out of the wound or the sore or pus has penetrated, then there is no hope for his treatment nor for removing the arrow. If the arrow hit the bladder and urine was discharged.
Something protruded from it towards the outside and the pain intensified on the patient. Know that he is dying, as for other body parts such as the face, eye, neck, shoulder, back, lower back, thighs and legs and so forth of the body, they have accepted the worst of situations.
If the arrow did not hit a blood vessel or nerve, and the arrow was not poisoned, I will inform you about some of what I have witnessed regarding these arrows to help in your treatment. Specifically, an arrow had hit a man in his eye's socket at the root of his nose.
I removed it for him from the other side under his earlobe and he was cleansed, and nothing undesirable happened to his eye. I extracted another arrow for a Jew who had been hit in his lower eyelid under the bottom lash, the arrow had disappeared and there was no damage except its small end that sticks into the wood.
An arrow was large, one of the composite arrows of the Cossacks made of smooth iron without any fins, it freed the Jew and nothing harmful happened to his eye. I extracted another arrow from a necklace of a Canaanite, and the arrow was Arabic.
And he who has two ears, I made a cut between his cheeks. He had penetrated his neck and was being eased until it came out; we removed the right and left shoulders, and he became well, and another arrow was pulled from a man who had pierced himself in his stomach, and we judged that he would die of it.
And after remaining for a period of thirty days or nearly so, and there was no change in his condition, I cut the arrow and adapted to it, then removed it. He did not experience any further ill-health, and I saw a man who had an arrow piercing him in his back; the wound adhered to it.
And after seven years, the arrow came out from his leg, I saw a woman who had an arrow pierce her abdomen and the wound adhered to it; the arrow remained inside. Her condition did not change in any way and she did not find any harm in any of her natural actions.
I saw another man who had an arrow pierce his face and the wound adhered to it. He did not find much pain from it, and there are many like this. I removed an arrow for a commander of the Sultan who had pierced himself in the middle of his nose slightly tilting towards the right.
The arrow completely left. I was called to treat him after the insertion of the arrow for three days, and I found the wound very narrow; I searched it with a delicate probe and did not feel anything. He had hair and flesh under his right ear from the cut.
I hoped that the hair was from the end of the arrow. I treated the wound with a dressing that had a pulling and hardening power, hoping it would cause swelling in the area and show a sign of the arrow. I cut him again, but there was no incident to indicate that the arrow reached the location.
I prolonged the dressing for him for many days, nothing happened and he did not suffer any adverse effects. Eventually, within that wound it closed up over time and the pus remained unappealing until he felt a spear inside his nose one day; upon informing me about this I treated his wound with potent medicine for several days.
Until it opened and the spear went through him, I felt its thin point sticking into the wood. Then I continued to expand the wound with this potent medicine until we could clearly see the end of the spear, and for several months afterwards, it was as if it was following me, reaching a duration of about four months.
And once the wound had expanded and I was able to insert forceps into it, they attracted and moved it. Since it did not respond to removal, I continued to soothe it and adapt my approach with various machines until one day, I successfully retrieved it with tight forceps as depicted in the concluding illustration of this chapter.
And physicians used to determine that the nasal cartilage would not heal properly; thus, they treated it by closing up the wound completely and curing the patient thoroughly without any further injury, as I am about to tell you how some spears were removed, which will serve as an example and evidence of things I have not mentioned.
As for the components of this craft and its details, they cannot be understood through description and are not fully captured in a book. Rather, the skilled artisan measures with small things on large ones, relying on what is present to infer what is absent, deriving new works and new machines when faced with strange phenomena.
If I were to leave this craft, I would say that spears only come out of the organs where they took root in two ways: either by being drawn from the place it entered from or from against the other side, and it comes out from where it entered.
Either the arrow sticks within a piece of flesh, attracting and extracting itself if not stopped from exiting at its appointed time. If it was prevented from doing so during that time, you should leave it for days until the flesh around it decomposes, making extraction easier. The same applies if it appears in bone.
If it did not stop you from removing the arrow, leave it alone for days and attempt to attract and move it each day; if will come out. If after days it does not stop you from removing it, you should puncture around the arrow in every direction on the same bone with a small hole until the hole widens enough for the arrow, then pull and remove it.
If the arrow is deeply embedded in a bone of the head and has penetrated into one of the cavities of the brain, and some of the symptoms I mentioned to you are showing from above, then hold off on attracting the arrow and leave it alone until after days pass and it resolves its issue.
It involves attracting and extracting the arrow. If it is deeply stuck and does not respond to attempts at extraction, use the small holes around the arrow as described to you. Then treat the area until it heals. And if the arrow has disappeared into a part of the body. And if it has lost sensation, probe with a probe and when you feel the arrow pull it back using some of the tools that are suitable for extracting arrows. If you cannot do it because of the narrowness of the wound or because of the depth of the arrow in the cavity, or there is no bone or nerve or blood vessel nearby.
Cut him until the wound widens and allows the arrow to remove it. If he has two ears, hold them both; remove all the inflamed flesh from every side with all your methods until you can do so and occupy yourself if you cannot remove the flesh by breaking his ears and letting him go.
And when you try to remove the arrow in any place, use your fingers to feel around all sides until you extract it. Be extremely gentle to avoid breaking the arrow, which could make it harder for you to pull and remove it. If you cannot do this due to lack of time.
Leave him for days until the surrounding flesh rots, then resume your actions. It becomes easier afterwards. If blood starts to flow and you encounter a wound, use the treatment method that was mentioned in its chapter, and protect yourself from cutting through nerves or arteries. Use your tactics.
Try all angles for extracting the arrow and do so with care, patience, and steadiness as I have described to you. When pulling out the arrow, make sure it's in its original position before it was hit - this will be more effective.
If you cannot do this, use whatever methods are within your reach. As for the arrow that comes out from the opposite side - it either protrudes something outward or you will feel a part of the arrow beneath the skin near the top and see it emerging.
Cut him and the cut should be as wide as your fingers allow. Then pull it, it will facilitate its removal. If it gets stuck in bone, use your hand to twist until the arrow hits the bone, expands, then pull it.
And otherwise, leave him for days and resume until it comes out. If the arrow is inside on return, push it with your hand. If the stick has fallen and you want to use a push instead, insert the hollow machine into its hoof hole, then push it with that.
If the arrow is bent, push it with an apparatus that enters this cavity; thus, the arrow becomes easier to remove. If the arrow is poisoned, you should scratch off all of the flesh that has become contaminated by poison if possible, then treat it with what suits such a case.
If the arrow is in the chest or abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side and it is near what is attached by the clapper and you can cut into it, then cut and beware of removing a vein or nerve and remove it.
Then mark the incision, if it requires sewing, then treat it until it heals. Image of the calivers that attract arrows:.
Its ends are somewhat tubular like a bird's beak, made as if it were a tool when you grip the arrow or leave something untouched. It can be made in various sizes big and small and medium, all of which depend on the size of the arrow and its thickness, and the width and narrowness of the wound.

Image of the poisoned maul:
This is like an arrow at the tip of the mace, which makes it easier to enter the hollow arrow and push it.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
In the section of veins.
The veins that the custom is to divide in the body are thirty veins, of which six are on the head. The pulsating veins behind the two ears known as the two Hypophyseal (hypophysis), and the two arteries in the prominent jawbones. Also the two veins at the back of the eyes known as the Two Eye Observers.
The draining veins in the center of the forehead, the ones in the tip of the nose and the two on the neck, as well as the two on the upper lip and the two on the lower lip. These are known as the jeherk veins and the two veins under the tongue.
And as for the veins that drain in the arm and hand, they are five. One of them is the ulnar vein, from the back side. It is commonly known as the head vein and the middle of the eye, composed of a branch of basilic vein and part of ulnar vein. It is also generally referred to as the body's vein.
And the basilic vein, which is on the front side and is also known as the cubital vein. It is generally referred to as abdominal vein and arm cord. The latter is located above the sternum, connected in a visible manner on top of the wrist, while the axillary vein (the origin).
And this is the vein located between the hip bone and heel bone, it has two branches. In the leg and foot there are three veins, one under the kneecap on the back side and second is the tibial vein which is located at the ankle on front side, also called the "saphenous vein", found behind in the backside.
In the other leg, there are three veins of the same kind. As for the two veins behind the ears, they serve as a benefit in clearing out persistent diseases such as dyspnea, fever and headaches along with their bad chronic forms. How to clear them is explained according to my description.
It involves shaving the hair on the back of the neck and making a deep, good incision at the place where the veins are. Then strangle the animal until the veins become visible behind the ears in the lower parts of the head; you then inspect them with your fingers and where you feel their pulse under your finger is where you should puncture it with the needle.
Then take a small scalpel, known as the 'nashal', and insert it under the skin until the tool reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the artery and skin upwards, cutting the artery together with the skin in strips. The length of these cuts will be up to two inches included.
Or in the way you release as much blood as desired, then bind them with tourniquets and leave them until recovery. In the first book, it mentions cutting and tying both of them, but the two veins in the axillae are useful for releasing chronic congestion of the sister gland, difficult headaches, constant dizziness and sudden overflow of excessive thirst directed to the eyes.
And how to cut them as I describe to you, it tightens the elderly person's neck with a cloak until the veins appear clearly on his skin and they become visible under your finger. Then you learn through ink, then lift the skin above the top of the vein by your index finger.
Then insert the tool 'nashal' from below and raise the artery upwards, cutting it in the same way as you did with the other arteries. Release blood to the extent of your need, then relieve the elderly person's strangulation and place your finger on the artery for a moment.
Then place a cotton and tourniquet on him, tighten the pull above tightly, and leave it until he recovers. As was mentioned about their mention, cutting, and rinsing in the first book, while cutting the forehead sweat gland is useful for the causes of long-term facial disorders such as acne, sores, and the slight redness.
And how to cut him as I describe to you, it chokes the elderly person's neck with a cloak until the sweat appears. Then take the tool which is called the "awl," and this is its image:.
Place the ring that is at the tip of the scalpel on the same plane and hit it from above with a comb or something else towards it, allowing the blood to flow to the extent you desire. Then remove the airlock and tighten until it clears.
And a wide incision may be made, but it should not have a sharp edge like other incisions. It should instead have a slightly broad tip and be somewhat flattened for shaping, as the bone is close by; the forceps might break if they are too thin.
As for the two veins in the eye sockets, their function is to relieve various eye ailments such as rashes, redness, and pathways diseases, as well as skin conditions. As for how they are performed, it involves tightening the neck of the patient with a headband, then spreading them while standing behind him. Let the spreading be somewhat elongated towards length by using a small forceps that is slightly broad.
If there is no flesh in the location, then if the forceps has a thin tip, it might break. Then send out the blood as needed and place a cotton on top of both and tighten them for one night, then separate them. As for the nose veins spreading, it helps with severe fevers.
And for severe headache and facial diseases like red inflammation of the nose, especially if it is chronic, as well as how to perform a spreading involves tightening the neck of the patient, then hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin long forceps.
And insert it in the middle of the rabbit itself between the nasal bones on a straight line, as there is no sense perception for blood there; the blood will be forced out from its vessel. You should hold your forceps lightly with your hand and let out the required amount of blood then tie him up for one night as it heals quickly.
And as for the goiter, its advantage is to puncture them because of tightness of the breath and onset of syphilis and black diseases which appear on the surface of the skin such as the black eye, the abscesses, the bad sores, and warts, and how to puncture them that the pus under them tightens the neck of the sick person. And the surgeon stands at the head of the sick person.
And the ill person is seated on a chair, then the sweat is punctured lengthwise into a somewhat wide and shallow incision. Then remove as much blood as you judge appropriate or according to what your judgement calls for in need of this action. Do similarly with the other sweat gland, and afterwards release the bandage.
And he tightens the sweat glands moderately so that they do not choke the ill person and leaves him until morning, because it heals his wound. As for the glands of the scrotum, its advantage is to puncture them after piercing the epididymis, as it benefits from its purging effect in the mouth and decay of the gums and bad sores, and dryness between the lips and bad sores.
And those that are in the nose and around it, and how to puncture them so that he sits the ill person in front of you and ties his neck with a scarf. Then turn his lips and look at the two sweat glands which you see one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left side, and distinguish them by their darkness.
And also, there are small, dark sweat glands around them; cut them into indented cuts. If it worries you and you do not understand what they are, aim for a larger cut and demonstrate it. Similarly, do this with the two sweat glands that are in the lower lip.
And as for the two sweat glands that are under the tongue, their advantage is to puncture them after piercing the epididymis for the granules that occur in the throat due to the disease of leprosy and mouth diseases. How to puncture them is to sit the ill person between your hands with a shoe on his foot and lift his tongue and look under his tongue next to one sweat gland and the other side of his tongue, observing their color until it becomes dark.
Divide them and keep them, do not focus on cutting them. For there are arteries under them which may cause bleeding from those arteries. As for the three veins that one divides in the armpit, they are the ones that people usually cut, and their removal is done with two aspects.
Either by fixing with a broad pomegranate stake or an olive stake to the pit, or by cutting with a narrow knife one is doing the removal [and this is its picture], the picture of the broad pomegranate stake:
It should be broad as you see, to suit opening the sunken and protruding cavities filled with thick blood as in gangrene. And this is the picture of the olive stake:
This is the thinner stake with sharper ends, suitable for removing narrow veins containing thin, watery blood. And this is the picture of the removal tool:
This needle is suitable for cutting, and there are different types of fine and narrow needles depending on the size of the veins. It can be used even in tight spaces, it's a common tool among craftsmen.
And as for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, its benefit in removing it is that it draws blood from the conditions that are under the neck and around the throat leading to the chest and abdomen. The surgeon should be cautious when removing it, being close to his neck because there might be an artery under him; if he makes a mistake and adds force while fixing the stake, he may cut this artery.
If it causes bleeding, then it is not appropriate to remove it with a pomegranate stake; instead, it should be removed by cutting with the needle. If the basilic vein does not clearly appear, then it should be avoided or one may choose another method or ask for advice from its community.
If the site of the injury is a section of an arm's cord, he explains and pierces it with the needle as we have said. If you wish to puncture it at a specific point, it would be better before stretching the arm to mark the position until you identify where the pulse is then learn on that with thread.
Then, you should tie the arm and make a slit in the skin with the needle as we have said. Try to ensure that your strike is not over the place of the artery. When you see when pulling on the band there is a bulge at the spot where you were taught with thread, this is an expansion of the artery. Avoid it.
If you see the blood when piercing like how urine from a child would flow and it is thin, red, then know that this is arterial blood. Then promptly place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger; if the blood stops significantly, often blood will stop so pull on the arm.
Leave it, warn the patient not to neglect this and make them wear a bandage without moving it for days until it heals. If the blood doesn't stop and persists despite your efforts, if there is no medication that works against it, expose the artery to you if it appears; its ends will constrict and thus stop the bleeding.
Or take a hazelnut skin, cut it and take one half, pull it tightly on the spot of the wound with the bandage and ligatures until another day. If the bleeding stops then leave him otherwise apply the methods mentioned earlier for stopping bleeding by tying off vessels. Cutting his blood supply is not difficult in most cases.
For small wounds where the bandage can remain on the arm, you should know this. As for the dark sweat, it is beneficial to puncture it so that it draws blood from the top of the head and lower body; as it consists of a branch from the basilic vein and a branch from the cephalic system, as we have said.
It is necessary for the surgeon that he should have a bone from his cutting instrument on his neck. If there is a nerve under it, and if the number of sutures in the wielder increases and hits the nerve, pain might occur which would be hard to see, and possibly wouldn't disappear at all. This nerve is often perceivable by touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is so thin that it cannot be seen, then you should make a cut near it as close as possible and avoid the nerve with your efforts. If there's sweat between two nerves, then making a cut along its length would be beneficial, but for sweat glands, it can provide utility when using your scalpel to draw blood from the head.
And it benefits in eye diseases, especially if you want to make a cut in this sweat gland;lt;make the cutgt; with a olive pitting instrument or with a broad thorn pitting tool because it is the safest of all cuts as there is no artery nor nerve under it.
However, it is necessary for you when making the cut to avoid hitting just the muscle head with the pitting tool and look for a soft area. It won't harm him if in his first strike he needs to hit him again several times, but maybe some people might swell if they are not punctured in the initial strike.
But this tumor will not harm him in any way, as for the technique of making the puncture and its consequences, and what should be done in his improvement first, it is necessary to understand that a puncture can only be used solely to preserve health.
And either it can be used in diseases, where a puncture is made to maintain health and continuity, and prevent the occurrence of diseases. This involves making a puncture in one of the three veins found in the arm, which are sweat gland, ochre vein, and basilic vein. The puncture should be made at the first pulse if there are indications of congestion.
The amputation shall be performed on Sunday or Tuesday, three hours after the day has passed. As for the amputation used in diseases, it does not have a limited time but whenever need and necessity call for it during night or day.
And in every hour and at every time, it should not be that the genitals of boys are amputated until they reach fourteen years old nor those of elderly men who have surpassed sixty years. If someone intends to perform amputation for any reason.
It is necessary to cleanse his bowels before amputation with a gentle injection if there is much accumulated feces, so that it does not become trapped in the veins during amputation from the intestines; a foul smell would harm the main organs. Amputation should not be performed on those who are bloated, diabetic or have diarrhea until this condition disappears.
Amputation should also be cautious after menstruation, vomiting, diarrhea, over-sexual activity, exhaustion, exercise, night-time wakefulness, fasting and anything that might weaken body or mental health. Then, you should examine the coagulation of blood before that if the blood is thick.
By means of food, drinks and medicines if possible, then he should take a bath if there is no hindrance or engages in some sport to make his blood flow. He should perform amputation during the middle of the day as we mentioned before. Moreover, he should spare his chest from all bad mental symptoms that day.
Just like worries, anger, fear and all physical symptoms such as fatigue, over-excitement, sex and similar conditions, he prepares the things that people usually use according to their habits from varieties of delicious foods, spices, entertainments and so on, each person within what they are capable.
Then the surgeon places the patient on a pillow which is higher than the pillow the operated person is lying on. Then, he extends his arm and has the surgeon grasp it with his hand two or three times. After that, he tightens the bandage around the elbow and does this action two or three times, making sure the tension is moderate.
As the tension, if it is not moderate, either by over-tightening which prevents blood flow, or by relaxing too much also preventing blood flow. After the tension, it should be necessary for the operated person to hold both hands together with one hand on top of the other.
Until the veins puff up and can be felt by touch. Then, the surgeon rubs the patient's palm with a stick dipped in ancient oil. After that, he places his index finger of his left hand under the same vein close to where he intends to puncture slightly to prevent the vein from moving and avoid hitting it. This is because some veins behave like the radial artery, which moves when punctured. And from them, there are those that are full of air. When the needle is placed on such a vein, it sinks below the needle and tricks the surgeon into thinking he has not punctured the vein, but if the vein does get punctured then the opening would be narrow.
For this reason, it is necessary for the surgeon to be cautious in all these matters. Then the needle should descend if the vein opens on that first try; otherwise, he will try again immediately under or above that position if the spot does not swell.
If the pus or inflammation is present, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage. It might have attracted heat which may cause swelling; avoid taking a bath also. Then resume puncturing if desired. If the needle pierces and the opening is small with mild bleeding.
I feared it would not yield the amount of blood you desire, therefore renew the incision within itself maintaining its straightness and slightly increase the aperture. Do this promptly before the site swells for many individuals do experience swelling at small openings.
Should you notice that it has swollen, do not hesitate to intervene; there is nothing that will benefit you in this situation. Place something on it with frankincense oil instead; it facilitates the flow of blood and is more advantageous in this location than pure olive oil and other unguents.
Use frankincense oil in all your wounds during the absence of blood flow. This can be done by both the physician and the pharmacist; if one places it on the wound from either of their sides, the blood will dissipate when it is thick.
If a large lump appears in the wound site, this happens often, especially to those who only have surgery once or had small openings for wounds. Take action immediately and place an impregnated sponge with warm salt water on the lump. Keep it there for an hour; it will dissolve.
It is necessary to do this after the blood has fully drained from the wound itself or from another wound. If something remains in the site after several days, either of darkness or greenness, it does not harm; if you prefer, add a bit of patience and dissolved vinegar to it.
Or a squeeze from the foding fruit and similar substances, often a lump and a cyst form near the surgery of the basilic vein. Place your hand on it; if you find that it feels hot when you touch it, indicating that it is an infected cyst, then be careful not to apply anything as described.
It might bleed from the artery, so bind it with what is in it until the area hardens then treat it further with other treatments until it heals. It's critical that for every person you take out enough blood based on their strength and the predominant color of their blood.
If the blood is black, let it expel until it turns red. Likewise, if you see it thick, let it drain until it thins out. Even if it's sharp, let it go until its sharpness disappears. It is necessary for one who is full and strong, needing to release blood in a single dose.
Expand the sweat duct and make it wide. For those who are weak, do the opposite and it is necessary for him to expel it in stages with a narrow hole. The best tool used for the sweat duct should be grooved and hollowed out, having no ridge.
This type of sweat gland is effective in bleeding and cutting nerves, being simple and safer than the lateral extension method. When someone performs this incorrectly during sweating sessions, it's advisable to feed them some soaked bread in a mixture of date palm water or sandalwood water before starting the process.
If it is hollowed and blood has been allowed to flow out in three or four stages, then if the person has a cool disposition they should take soaked bread with a drink of miba water, or honey-sweetened water, or a nice mint beverage before the process starts.
If the mistake happens during the sweating process due to excessive bleeding, it is necessary to drink meat water and a gentle mint beverage. The use of galbanum for fomentation should be employed, and his chest should be rubbed with it. All other measures mentioned in our previous section about mistakes should also be utilized here.
The one who has frequent urination, and if someone wants to relieve their arm and relax their blood flow again, it is necessary for him whose sweat gland results in much urination and his strength is weak that the blood be released a little bit at a time according to his strength over consecutive days.
And if someone wants to comfort his arm and relieve his blood a second time, and he is strong-bodied, let him do it between seven or nine hours of the first division. And for one who wants to draw blood from his body to against the side that leaned towards, it would be better for him to have it done on the second or third day.
And if there's much blood in his body that has heated and increased, causing fever, it should be bled in one go, removing a large amount of it. The opening should be expanded until the skin is exposed after ensuring all conditions for cutting have been met. And place your hand on his pulse while blood is flowing, to avoid death occurring at the incision site. This happens often if the surgeon lacks knowledge and makes a mistake, and it should not happen when you want to relieve his arm and release the blood again.
And if the sweat gland's mouth has closed, making it hard for blood to escape, don't apply force or pressure as that is very bad. Either let him be until he heals again or lean with the scalpel scraper on the hardened blood in the sweat gland's mouth.
Or, you can place something made of salt dissolved in water on him or use a poultice from the yellow fever grass or black pepper. Gently apply pressure until blood comes out; if the sweat gland has swollen, leave it alone.
And don't touch him until the lump subsides. If necessity demands to release blood again, it must be done; either cut above that location or in the other arm or on the other sweat gland.
And if there's a ligature in the arm, it should be cut instead of the axilla and basilic veins if they aren't available or are hidden as it is made from them. The method to perform this involves dipping your hand into hot water until the band turns red and the sweat gland appears clearly, then applying mild but firm pressure with a ligature.
Then the sweat escapes with a slight deviation, not for any sign or length, let the incision be wide and have your cut above the elbow joint slightly. If blood does not come out, reposition your hand in the container of hot water and let the blood flow within the water.
Until your need is met, if you are in summer days, you may be able to dispense with repositioning your hand in the hot water. More often than not, having blood flow within the hot water is easier during winter time. And this cut is safer compared to all other cuts. Because there is no harmful sweat or nerve below it, as for the cut on the right hand, it is beneficial when dealing with liver conditions and how to perform this cut: you should pull the wrist by means of the bracelet or your hand after placing it in hot water until the sweat swells.
Because there is no harmful sweat or nerve below it, as for the cut on the right hand, it is beneficial when dealing with liver conditions and how to perform this cut: you should pull the wrist by means of the bracelet or your hand after placing it in hot water until the sweat swells. It is very evident and then it splits with a slight deviation, even if you remove it all, it would not harm him in any way. Be cautious but don't hold your finger on the clippers too long because there's a nerve under it, and the area is bare of flesh. Then return your hand to the hot water.
And let it for the blood to flow there. If you don't expose it to hot water, the blood will congeal in the sweat pore and prevent its flow. So when you have drained as much blood as needed, apply oil and salt on the wound so that it doesn't heal too quickly.
Likewise, it should be done with every narrow part. As for the benefit of cutting on the left hand, it is useful for conditions related to the gallbladder just as you do when cutting the second one, and concerning the cut on the side (chest), its benefit lies in diseases located at the bottom of the body such as those affecting the reproductive organs.
Retention of semen and diseases related to the kidneys, as well as chronic swellings in thighs and legs and similar ailments, and how to help a man immerse himself into hot water and carry kneading massage until pores open up then tighten over the knee joint, being visible towards the thumb.
And many branches spread from this on the man's face. It is better and more religious to spread it in the widest branch of his face or at the ankle when they meet, than spreading it on the man's face; one would be cautious about the nerves under it on the man's face.
Have your incision made so that it looks like you're about to amputate him, making the surgeon look casual. If blood does not come out, have him immerse in hot water and let the blood flow until it is fully drained out. If the extractor makes a mistake with bleeding during the first attempt.
Have the incision go slightly above it. The location is safe and not fearful of it if protected from the nerve as we said, similarly do this with other parts of a man's leg. As for women's sweat, its place is as we mentioned at the heel on the backside.
The advantage of performing a thigh incision for hip pain if that is due to hot blood, and how to perform it by letting the patient enter the steam bath quickly and tighten their leg from the hip up to the ankle with four fingers using a thin long glove. It only appears through this method.
If it appears, perform the incision on any situation. Either remain in a modified position which is better, or amputate it with a cut, its location being safe. It's very hidden in most people though, if you can't find it.
For it does not instantly appear, so I cauterize some of their people and that which appears in the back of the foot towards the thigh and knee joints, preserving nerves and vessels, from a proportionate amount of blood as desired.
Then the cauterization was done, placing cotton on the place of the cauterization and tightening the place. Soon it becomes free.
The sixtieth and ninth chapter.
In bloodletting and how to use it.
The pincers for bloodletting can be made of horns, wood, copper or glass. Bloodletting is performed in two ways: one involving pressing the point and releasing the blood, and the other without pressing.
And this form of bloodletting without pressing has two aspects.
The pinchers for the inner eyes, these are two sheets of the neck from both sides, the pinchers for the jaw which is under the lower jaw of the mouth, the pinchers for the shoulders, and the pinchers on the back of the knee cap, the pinchers for the knees, they are in the middle of the arms, and the pinchers for the thighs.
Bloodletting draws blood from the dilated capillaries within the flesh, and for this reason, it does not weaken like cauterization. Nor should bloodletting be performed with or without fire in diseases of accumulation so that the body can completely evacuate itself.
If the need for bloodletting arises from illness or custom, we use it at any time in the first week and last week of each month and in its middle, regardless of when that might be.
And among people, some of them when their blood has become too much need to get it out through bloodletting and find heaviness in their heads and headache. Among them are those who find fullness and redness on their faces, heads, and necks. Some of them have a scratchy face and beard and darkness and hunger in their eyes. Some of them wrinkle the place that needs to be bled.
Among them are those who excessively laugh, and among them are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth, spit it out, and bleed profusely. Some of them have excessive sleep, and some see during their sleep blood, redness, murders, wounds, and similar things. Whenever we see something like that.
Especially if it's in the middle third of the month, we're instructed to perform bloodletting after two or three hours into the day. As for the benefit of bloodletting through puncturing (nicking), it relieves heaviness in the head and fluid that accumulates towards the eyes.
However, it should be after exhausting the body's resources. This bloodletting can substitute for bleeding with a comb and one must take care not to use it on someone who has cold blood or is suffering from congestion, as it would cause them great harm.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly, or those who have cold diseases in their head; and those who are addicted to it have experienced a loss of memory.
Therefore, it is recommended that the surgeon should allow his hand to move slightly downwards while bloodletting from the shoulder, fearing that memory loss might occur. As for bloodletting in the armpit, it substitutes for bleeding with a comb and on the base of the neck.
Therefore, it relieves bronchitis, difficulty in breathing, congestion of the respiratory mechanism, cough and suffocation, and it is advisable that the collar be lifted slightly because if it becomes downward it produces weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for collar manipulation, it relieves sudden pains in the head, fevers, headaches, throat pain and dental pain. It also replaces damage to the basilar artery; it is advisable that the surgeon not plunge his hand too deep into the neck in order to avoid cutting an artery which may cause hemorrhage.
As for the abdominal suction, it relieves stomach ulcers and decay of gums and similar diseases that occur in the mouth. It can replace sucking out in the corners of the lips (jejahark). As for back suction, it relieves pleurisy caused by congestion and heat.
As for the abdominal suction in the navel region, it relieves what is relieved by sucking out of three arteries - basilar artery, jugular vein and carotid artery. This is because it draws blood from all those small veins that are found inside the flesh and draws those smaller veins from even thicker ones until the suction reaches to these three major veins.
It is necessary to instruct the surgeon not to delve deeply into the condition as the area is bare of flesh and contains nerves and arteries underneath. As for the one who performs suction on the palate, she relieves constipation-associated sores and bottom rashes.
It is necessary to instruct the surgeon that the suction implement should be large and made of metal as this area requires a strong suction and perhaps glass suction cups may break, also it needs many precautions. As for calf suctioning, it significantly reduces congestion.
Because it attracts blood from the whole body and relieves chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, bladder and improves urine production. It is also beneficial for acne and boils, acting like a substitute for circumcision and prostate operations. However, it excessively weakens the body, causing deceitfulness among most people, and the benefits of treating the prostate are nearly as effective as leg lancing.
The method of applying the hot compresses involves placing an empty one first, and then applying a moderate amount of heat. Do not leave it in place for too long; instead, you should apply them quickly and remove them just as swiftly to allow the heat to settle evenly onto the area. Keep repeating this process until you see that the area has turned red and opened up.
The blood turns red at this point. When that happens, you should apply more heat gradually and slowly. Then you check the condition of the skin; if someone has tender flesh with visible pores, it might be necessary to only use one heat treatment because excessive heat could burn the area.
The person performing the lancing procedure should widen the opening slightly and deepen it a little, applying heat gently with gentle movements. If there is thick blood in the veins, it might be necessary to lance twice; during the first attempt, you make room for the flow of blood and its cooling off. In the second attempt, there's no need to seek out the thickly boiling blood.
If the blood is very thick, you may repeat the lancing process a third time to achieve your goal. In short, if we want to remove a little bit of blood, one lancing is enough. But if we want to remove a lot of blood, we should perform more aggressive lancing. And if we determine that the blood is going to be thick.
In such a case, one should use a deep lancing technique where the depth of the opening is just within the skin. It is not advisable to use certain ointments when applying hot compresses and water, and precautions should be taken by those who perform the procedures. For someone with thick, hard, rough skin and small pores.
It is necessary that the sites of the sores be coated with open, finely ground ointment. However, if it's summer time, then such substances as balm-oil, or carmine, or sweet walnut oil, or poppy-seed paste should be used.
And if it's winter, then such substances as narcissus oil, or myrtle oil, or honey bee's wax oil, or onion paste and the like should be used. If the pus is thick and cold, then the ointment should be made of rhubarb oil, or snail mucus, or beeswax, or sparrow's dung, and similar substances.
If the person bled has large pores, it's preferable not to apply ointment. In such cases, those who have undergone bloodletting should wash their sores after bleeding with rose water or cold water or grape juice water or poppy water, and substances similar to them. However, for one whose blood is very moist.
The sites of bleeding should be washed with vinegar or asafetida water, sycamore sap, and substances similar to them. For those whose pus is thick, they should wash their sores with old wine, rhubarb water, sparrow mixture, honey bee's wax, and similar items. It is necessary to avoid bloodletting in the bath or immediately after bathing.
However, it is necessary to use the remedies an hour or two after exiting the bath. It is not recommended for anyone who has undergone bloodletting to go to sleep immediately afterwards. There are certain things that both the person undergoing bloodletting and the surgeon should avoid before and after bloodletting.
Firstly, you should check if the person undergoing bloodletting or who has just undergone surgery is of a dry constitution with a predominant hotness and inflammation. In such cases, it is advisable for them to take cooling remedies like pomegranate, spinach, cucumber, honey, and basil among others. Their diet should consist of thin soups made from goat meat, dried fruits, and similar items.
Whoever has a cold disposition, it is desirable that they drink a drink of honey and a drink of water mixed with mint or fennel seeds. They should consume the moderately fragrant wine which exists between tradition and modernity, be prescribed to limit food intake, make their diet consist of pigeons, doves, sparrows, and hen's eggs, and increase their liquid intake especially during fasting days prior to bloodletting and purification rituals.
It may be desirable for some people at certain times to drink the famous vinegar or use musk or thyme before bloodletting and before fasting, or after it, in order to strengthen the main organs and purify the blood. However, it should not be consumed by those who are forbidden from doing so.
As for the bloodlettings that are not conditional, they are those placed on the liver and gallbladder, lungs and stomach, and kidney position. They are also placed under the ribs, at the right side of the thigh, as these organs cannot bear the condition being placed upon them. Rather, their purpose is to either draw blood from one organ to another.
Just as we place the bloodletting on the lungs for the purpose of sweating, or use it to cool a hot organ that has become warm in the organ. As when we place the bloodletting on the stomach and the ribs, they shake up the organ and warm it up, expelling pain through this cooling breath.
And it can be placed on the kidneys if there is a plug or stone in them, and by its force of drawing, maybe it could open the plug or remove the stone from its place. Similarly, when it's applied to the liver and gallbladder with a confused wind blowing through both, these bloodlettings can be used empty only with the breath.
And it can be used with fire, and also filled with steaming water for the purposes of sweating. The bloodletting is filled to be large with only hot water or water that had been boiled in which some herbs suitable for this have been added.
Then it is placed filled at the location and held until removed, and this process is repeated as needed. This describes how an ember is used in a surgical procedure.
Their mouth capacity is two fingers open as depicted, its depth measured to be half a span. There would be a small hole about halfway down the side of it, sized just for an acupuncture needle to fit through. It's made from Chinese brass or yellow copper with thick edges.
It is a flat, smooth base to avoid injuring the organ when placed upon it. In its center there's an obstruction made from brass or iron called a wick which is lit with fire when placing the candle on it. This tampon might be large than what we described, and smaller depending on the illness.
We will use this for it; the tampons used for children and postpartum women are not the same as those used by men or older men. As for how to place this tampon on fire in the organ, you light a wick made of tightly wound cotton or a small candle from cork, then place it at the center of the hardened stick in the middle of the tampon.
The flame should ascend from the bottom towards the top of the tampon, avoiding burning off the wick of the one in need. Then it's placed on the organ and the finger is kept over the mentioned hole until we don't need to remove the finger when holding the tampon.
The steam then exits from that hole, and the tampon dissolves in its place. Afterward, light the wick as described, repeating it if needed. For the tampon used in a disease like scalding with water, there is no hardened stick or hole inside it.
Only this method is used where it's filled with water and placed only on the organ. Here's its depiction:.
This sentence in English translates to: "And this pessary, the larger it is for containing much water, the better it is.
The translation for "الفصل السابع والتسعون" is "Chapter seventy-nine".
The translation for "فى تعليق العlec." is "In hanging commentary.
The hanging (method) is only used in most cases for organs where the insertion of pessaries cannot be done either because of their small size like the mouth, tongue and such or because the organ is bare from flesh as fingers, nose and such.
And the way to use it is about the hanging (method) that refers to water which is clean from diseases, then leave it for a day and night in pure water until it ferments and there's nothing left inside. And first, the body is evacuated either through vomiting or bleeding, then the organ is cleaned.
Until it reddens, then it is placed on it. If it filled up, it falls off; and if the area can be wiped with a pessary, it is more beneficial. Otherwise, wash the area with soap, then with plenty of water, rubbing it. If after its fall, bleeding continues and this is due to fermentation, then soak a cotton swab in cold water.
And place it from above until the fermentation stops. If there is much blood, sprinkle on it with a dust of powder or vinegar or similar ingredients in bandages until the bleeding stops or place half of the ground parsley on the spot.
And leave it until the parsley sticks to the spot, then bleeding stops. It is necessary if you need a repetition of the treatment, do not hang this parsley method with others if possible, if pessary fails to stick, then clean the area with fresh blood.
Insert the needle in its place until some blood comes out, then leave it there. If she feels something of blood, she sticks to the spot; if you want her to come off, sprinkle her with some salt or ash or lime on the spot, and she will come off from the spot.
The third chapter.
In algebra.
This chapter is also necessary for all that one needs in the practice of medicine, which includes the algebraic treatment of fractures and the resolution of those occurring in bones.
Know that this chapter is called so by the doctors who are illiterate and by the common people, those who have never flipped through an old book or read a single letter from it.
And for this reason, the art of knowledge in our country has become extinct. I have never come across a single person who truly understands it properly. And what I have learned from it is what I have gleaned through the length of my reading of early books and my diligence in understanding them, extracting knowledge from them. Then, I followed trial and experience throughout my life.
And I have drawn for you from that in this chapter everything that encompasses my knowledge. And my experience progressed after presenting it to you and distilling it from the excess of elaboration, reducing it to its utmost brevity and clarifying it to its fullest explanation. I have depicted numerous images in it of the machines that are used in this field.
Here is an increase in explanation, as I did in the two preceding chapters. There is no power except in Allah, the Almighty.
The first chapter.
In neglecting and summarizing the matters of bone-breaking, it is necessary to present them. And before we start mentioning one by one the broken and detached parts, it would be wise to introduce some statements and divisions in this chapter. You are first compelled to understand and fully grasp its reality, not only you but anyone who is eager to learn this noble craft.
I would say that whenever a person experiences bone breakage, dislocation or any kind of falling, you should first focus on setting the bones, handling them, or both. If no obstacle such as weakness prevents it, and if the affected person is either a child or an old man, or if the time of year is extremely hot or cold, one should take these circumstances into account.
Then, his diet consists of cold legumes and bird meat, and he avoids drinking water and heavy meats. He also refrains from foods that fill the stomach with blood until the swelling subsides and there is no expectation of fluid accumulation at the site.
When that happens, the patient should return to their usual treatment method. If the broken bone is set back into place, the patient should be fed with heavy foods like thick soups or stews containing ingredients similar to lentils, rice, peas, chickpeas, and cow's meat. These foods aid in the healing process. And eggs, fish, thick drinks, and so forth; by this method, the setting of fractures is more efficient and effective. Remember that broken bones in men who are robust or old cannot reconnect to their original state ever again.
Drying of their bones and their hardness, such that what was once fragmented may unite again like the tenderness of small children's bones. But nature grows on broken bones from all sides with something resembling glue, which is sticky and binds it until it sticks to itself.
Some parts bind to each other until it reaches the utmost strength and robustness as before, so that nothing impedes him in his actions.
For this reason, it is necessary that the patient's food contains toughness, stickiness, and hardness as we mentioned. Be aware that fractures can vary in type depending on the body part; a break in the leg bone differs from a head bone fracture, and a chest bone break differs from a back bone break.
Similarly, all other body parts differ from each other. We will describe each type of fracture in its own section with detailed explanations compared to others. The type of bone break can also vary within itself.
Because it can be a break without shards occurring, and the fracture could run along the bone with shards that are clean or not. There can also be fractures accompanied by wounds and skin breaches, and there can be slight fractures.
For each type, there is a particular method for mending it as I shall describe in its appropriate place. By which the nature of bone fractures can be understood - their curvature, thinning, and sensitivity to touch when you tap them with your hand.
If there is no visible curvature, no sensitivity to touch, and no disturbance felt in your bone when you press it, nor many symptoms of pain, then there is likely no fracture. Rather, it could be a sprain or a mild break or slight displacement that should not be manipulated at all.
But apply to him the medicines that will be mentioned subsequently when they suit the place. Then gently pull him with force, and know that if a bone is cut or fractured without causing fragments except that each part has left its companion,
You should promptly correct and adjust him when necessary before a hot tumor occurs in him. If a hot tumor does occur, leave it for days until the hot tumor subsides, then smooth it out in any way you can manage through gentleness and skill.
And know that correcting and adjusting a bone without fragments is easier than when there are pieces in it. Then, pull on what will be mentioned next, if the bone has pieces you must extend the broken limb from both sides, whether by hand or leg.
Either by your hands if the limb is small, or with two strings, or in combination of string and hand. Have your position such that the limb is on a flat surface matching its natural form until the broken part of the bone extends; then retract any excess back to their places through every means possible using skill and gentleness.
And strive that your effort does not cause pain or suffering on the injured due to your actions. And ensure that you bring together one of the bones with its companion in the best way possible. It is necessary at this time to touch and shape them with your hand; if you see something contrary, correct and adjust it as much as your ability allows.
And be wary of extreme pulling and harsh twisting, as many fools do. Often, they cause burns or temporary damage in the limb, which I have seen them repeatedly do.
Then, after ensuring the correct placement and smoothness, immobilize that limb with rest and care. Warn the injured person not to move it during their wakefulness or sleep, when they change positions or feel agitation, during defecation and all other movements of which there is no end; let them seek to ensure that the posture of the limb provides a level of comfort that alleviates pain.
That is, when he feels discomfort or pain in the position of his limb, and wants to move it from that position to another where he does not feel any discomfort. He investigates so as to make sure that this position is level and straight.
So there is no deformation in the limb if it's forced into a position. As for how to pull on the broken limb, I describe what I'm instructing you, be aware that broken limbs vary in size and shape; thus, smaller ones like the arm, fingers, and keys etc., are different from larger parts.
The bandages for the wound should be soft and not rough, while those areas that are bony like the thigh, back, and chest should have firm bandages as the broad ligament holds the larger limb and pulls it from all sides with an equal force without any interference.
Then, after you have completed the setting, you begin to apply the appropriate plaster. In gentle pressure on the break site, then you start wrapping the bandage around the break site itself for three or four turns depending on what is suitable for the limb. You slightly pull on the bandage with your hand and then move it upwards to the top of the break site.
With less pressure than you would apply to the broken site, then you slightly move away from the break site in your bandage and gradually ease off on the pressure until it takes a correct piece of what is right for the true position. Then, you take another strip and wrap it around the broken site as well.
Then, you wrap the bandages down to the bottom of the break. Your action in pulling and relaxing should be as we have described for the first upper wrap. Then, place a gentle pressure or wound between the bandages that matches what it takes to correct any deformity of the break.
If there are irregularities, leave nothing on it; then wrap it with another bandage. Then place the tight segments of your suture over these bandages if there is no inflation or hot tumor in the body.
If there is inflation or a hot tumor, apply something that calms the tumor and eliminates inflation. Leave it for days, then tighten the sutures at that time. The sutures should be made of half arrows' hair that has been finely carved with wisdom or they could be made from the wood of the cranebettle tree.
They are made from cedar, palm fronds, tamarisk or date palm sticks and similar items that have been prepared like this. Each suture should be of the same size and shape.
Except for the suture that is placed on the break itself, which should be a little wider and thicker than others. As for the length of the suture, it is made according to what suits the size of the broken member from its largeness or smallness, the image of the suture:
Then, tighten the sutures with another bandage according to your initial tightening exactly. Then secure it from above with tight threads as we mentioned in terms of tightening; that is to say, you should pull harder at the place of the break. The tighter it is away from the break, the less tightness there will be.
And the threads should be of medium thickness and smoothness, they should be made from wet camel wool in particular. Because if the threads are too thick like what I've seen from the ignorant people making them from inflated camel wool strips, it's a great mistake.
Because it leads to over-tightness with them being outside the balance, and the smooth threads are also unsuitable as you cannot achieve the tightness you want with them. There should not be less than a finger's width between sutures.
If a patient's extremities are injured by traction in the correct places, place under them something soft or fluffy material like cloth or wool to prevent harming him from that. If there is a fracture with a wound and skin rupture occurs, we will address it separately.
And know that not every broken member should be treated with traction from the first day. This is because if the member is large, it should not be subjected to traction until five days or seven or more, depending on your concern about the occurrence of heat-induced tumor.
And this is the characteristic of the bandages that were forced upon the initial ones placed on fractures, dislocations and tooth extraction. It's a common short bandage that forces the fracture, fits more substances especially for children and women because it doesn't get hot nor cold.
And it is to take from the dust of wheat flour, which sticks to the walls of the mill when the millstone moves. Mix it as it is, without washing it with egg white and make its consistency neither too thick nor too thin. Then spread it.
And this is another bandage that forces fractures, dislocations and tooth extraction. It's obtained from sheep wool, camel hair, camel humps, horses' heads, medicinal plants, each costing one tenth of a dirham and five dirhams for patience and perseverance, twenty dirhams from the silver beast (a type of metal), and twenty dirhams from Armenian or Roman clay. Everyone tightens it and mixes it with silver beast water or egg white if the patient's mood is hot. Then this bandage is used, as it has good composition; it quickly forces broken bones and fits most people due to its moderation.
A remedy for another one which also helps in fractures and abscesses, it is made from a mixture of one eleventh part of a medicine called Mashe' white, two parts of Marsh root and six parts of Armenian clay. Twenty parts are taken of the above ingredients finely ground, mixed with water or egg whites and then used.
A remedy for joints and bones that have moved out of their places, it relieves excessive pain and bone dislocation as well as fractures. It consists of white-washed wool which is soaked in vinegar and cooked oil. This is then placed on the affected area. The strength of this plaster does not rely on physical force.
However, it is excellent in soothing hot swellings and relieving pain, especially in cases of broken bones. Another remedy to set a broken bone involves using the inner bark of the pomegranate and the inner bark of the desert fig which are ground together. A two-fold application with this will be used, another brief plaster that is applied when there's fracture in the bone.
And if you wish to further reduce the size of the tumor, take one part each of white rush, borage and onion juice. Grind these together with pomegranate seed flour. If the affected organ is loose, grind it into a paste. If it's already loose, mix it with coriander water or water instead. Then use this as directed.
Another stronger plaster for dissolution when a hard tumor occurs during bone fractures is used. It consists of white rush root, seeds of the senna plant, basil leaves, king's crown flower, rhubarb and onion juice from each part only.
Grind everything together with lukewarm water or pure spring water, or with the paste, depending on the warmth of the organ and whether it is still hot. As for the olive oil, it's not mentioned in his book to be applied on a broken bone when setting it.
Only the cerate made from wax and oil, nothing else. It should be of a medium consistency between hardness and softness. As for Galen, he thought that when one breaks bones during setting them, it is better to use things that are dry like salt, something with heat such as mint, yogurt, and what we have mentioned.
A description of a poultice beneficial for weakness and pain, it is prepared using provisions (perhaps referring to food), fenugreek, human hair that has been combed or bird feathers, catgut thread, and salt. It should be ground, sifted, mixed together well, and then used as a poultice. As for the amount that ought to remain in the bandage.
Then, you should check: if there is no reason for the splint not to work (meaning, if it doesn't cause pain or inflammation and the broken bone isn't moving out of place), then there's no need to keep changing it often. However, if at the site of injury you find severe irritation or intense pain, or swelling.
Proceed to adjust the splint immediately; do not delay this action at all and remove the poultice. Instead, take a soft cloth or sea sponge that's wet and dip it in warm water, then wash the area until the itching subsides and the pain lessens. Then, let the body rest for an hour.
Then, cover him with the treated wool dipped in vinegar and oil or rose essence; bind it on at night to alleviate the hot lump, stop swelling, relieve the pain, then return him to gentle compression and soft poultice without pulling it tightly as your first attempt.
Continue treating it until healing occurs. If I see that the lump, redness, pain and swelling, along with all symptoms have completely disappeared and require a poultice or compression again, prepare it as you did at first either way. Provided there is no occurrence in the body of anything we've mentioned.
Do not remove it except after three days, or four, or five, or seven; and in some cases it may be left for twenty days. All of this depends on what you observe about the condition of the member as we explained, even if there is a break and the flesh begins to heal upon it.
And increase the tension over your initial effort throughout, and also enhance the abrasiveness of food for the one suffering from diarrhea as mentioned before. If you notice that the area of breakage has dried up and is lessened more than it should be, understand that food cannot reach there.
And extract it with lukewarm water every time you remove it, and do this every three days. Gently reduce the tension a little as this action allows food to move towards the organ and facilitates quick healing. As for what the ignorant do by using stimulants that break the organ again,
If it does not break as expected, but breaks due to pain alone, that is an error in their action and a great deception. Even if it was correct at some point which they mentioned earlier in their books and practiced it, I have never seen any effect of this from anyone among them definitely. The right thing is not to do it with that.
The Second Chapter.
In the frontal bone fracture.
The types of frontal bone fracture are numerous, with various shapes and causes. Some fractures occur due to a sword strike and may involve the entire bone up to where it ends at the sinus beneath the bone. Similarly, as it does in wood with the cutlass.
Therefore, this type of fracture is referred to as a cutlass fracture. Alternatively, the sword cuts some bone and removes only its edge without penetrating until the end of it; this type of fracture is called a blunt fracture. The injuries from these fractures can either be large or small.
The types of fracture which are brittle or compact, and whose cause is a blow with a stone or falling onto a stone or something similar, this type of fracture may either penetrate close to the membrane beneath the bone, or it may occur within the surface of the bone.
The wounds from these fractures can also be either large or small, and there is a type of fracture that is hidden within the bone in the hairline, which is a gradual expansion.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called 'hairlike' fracture. There's also a type that occurs from falling or hitting with a stone and similar objects; it penetrates into the bone surface becoming irregular in its location. It can become like brass if hit by a blow, entering part of it inside.
This is more common in wet bones like the heads of infants. All these types of fractures can have clean and unclean fragments, and we will discuss their treatment in their respective sections. We'll also identify all these types of fracture through examining them.
And inspecting them with probes, removing the rotten flesh from it. As for the 'hairlike' fracture, one should reveal its presence on the bone and smear or dip it in a liquid; if the fracture appears black. When treating fractures, you first observe the symptoms of the patient.
If I see symptoms that clearly indicate fear such as repeated vomiting, extension of the condition, loss of consciousness, interruption of speech, fever and severe redness around the eyes among other symptoms in the patient's condition, do not approach or treat him; death often occurs to him under these circumstances without exception.
And if I see no serious symptoms and suspect his safety, then you should start treating him in this case. This is because if the wounded hit him immediately after being injured and that was during winter days.
You should strive to remove the bone up until the fourteenth day, anyway. And if it's any days of summer, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day in order to prevent corruption underneath the bone from causing those symptoms we described.
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is a comminution and bleeding, it may be necessary to cut off the diseased portion that's fractured and spongy as I describe for you. This involves shaving off the head of the broken bone.
And when you expose the bone in any way that allows it, according to the appearance of the wound and what is revealed by the broken bone, if there is a blood flow or hot tumor upon inspection of the bone, respond to it with what needs to be done.
It is to fill the area with a puncture dipped in wine, grease and rum, to cleanse the wound until the tumor subsides and stops bleeding. Then you should proceed with securing and removing the bone, which can be done through one of two methods of the operation.
As for the first method, it involves cutting the bone with a fine, narrow saw blade; this is how it works:.
Then you use another cut after this one, slightly away from it. This is its form:.
You will also use another cut, further away from the second one. It is necessary for you to have several different cuts with some of them being wider than others and others being shorter than others. They should be extremely sharp at their tips and may be made of Indian iron or good quality steel.
Use gentleness in striking the cut to avoid dislodging the head and harming it. If the bone is strong and hard, you should pierce around it before using your drills which you call "non-submerged drills". However, you did not call them by that name; they are known as non-submerged drills.
Because it does not exceed the limit of the skull bone to beyond it, in order that the hole has a continuous edge below his sharp head resembling a bracelet or small circle preventing him from sinking and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
And it should be taken from these holes many quantities that each one of them is suitable for the thickness of this bone, until you find a pierced skull with its sharp tip in length and width as much as the thickness of that skull. This is an example of three types. The holes are large, medium, and small:.
And as for the manner of piercing around the broken bone, it is to make a hole in the bone and guide it with your fingers until you know that the bone has penetrated. Then move the hole to another place and after every hole leave the hardness or roughly equivalent there.
Then cut with the blades between each two holes, and do this to whatever extent you can manage with as much gentleness as we said until you break the bone either by hand or with something else from some of the instruments you have prepared for it.
Like the scissors and gentle tweezers, you should be extremely cautious that the hole or the cut does not touch anything of the membrane. If you have heated the bone and freed it from the membrane if attached, you should remove it. It is necessary to clean.
And smooth the roughness remaining in the bone with another tool resembling the cutter, but it should be finer and gentler than other cutters. If there is a piece of small bones or fragments left, you take them gently with any tools at your disposal.
Then the wound is treated after that with the stitches and ointments which are mentioned, while the other side of the operation is a simple one far from pitfalls, as Galen mentioned and praised greatly, this is his statement. Firstly, you should start by removing a part of the bone from the site where it broke, until you uncover this part of the bone. Underneath that, you place one end of this lens segment and this is how it looks:
This lens segment of it is smooth and does not cut anything, while the sharp part of it has its edges running in length as you see. The flat part of this lens should be placed against the cornea, with the sharp edge facing towards the bone. Then strike one side of the cut piece.
Using a small mallet, cut all the bone gently as it rotates and you are safe from any frightening events within the membrane. Even if the surgeon is ignorant or cowardly, yes, even if he is lazy, this method ensures safety.
If there's still some tissue left on the bone in certain parts of the bone, scrape it off with the sharp edge of this lens segment itself and remove it gently. It will be removed without causing any harm or fear.
And if the bone break did not reach the membrane, and what was broken from the bone is its face with roughness and small pieces left over, it should be scraped off with a smooth tool you have prepared in different sizes suitable for every place. You can use each one based on what work demands of you.
The broken bone and its shape should be used first for scraping the bone. Then use the finer tool afterwards. Continue this with loyalty until you utilize all the finest and most delicate tools available to you.
And as for the finer cuts and gentle fractures, each should be treated with a method that leads to improvement, which is not hard for one who has the slightest knowledge in this field. They should stop at what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after your bone extraction, it is necessary to take a camel's hair thread according to the depth of the wound and dip it in camphor oil. Then place it on the opening of the wound. Next, take another thread, bent or triangular. And dip it in a drink, oil, and camphor paste then place it on the first thread. Do this as thinly as you can so as not to weigh down the wound. Then use a wide bandage above it but pull only enough that the wound is just held by it.
Leave it treated like this for a day or two until the hot lump calms down. Then drain it and start using the remedies he has with him, such as crushed saffron roots, carthamus meal, powdered pinks, ground coriander, ground cinnamon, and similar. The treatment consists of making powders from these medicines.
Let it dry on the wound and in summary, always use a medicine that should purify rather than intoxicate. Strive hard to ensure your treatment of the wound remains clean, free from any oiliness or stickiness, and do not allow accumulation of pus.
Because if pus accumulates on the brain membrane, it deteriorates and contaminates it. This leads to great harm, especially when there is a cut in the forehead after bone exposure, particularly if care for its treatment is neglected.
In his surface, if you inspect it, you will find evidence for the symptoms we mentioned. Therefore, understand that he is doomed to die, even though the blackness occurred due to medication applied to him and it was a capability of this medication to cause this blackness.
You should take a portion from honey and three portions of rose oil, beat them well together, apply this mixture to the wound, then treat it with various kinds of treatment that is necessary until it heals.
The third chapter.
To correct the nose if it breaks.
Know that the nose does not break apart completely or just one of its halves, because they are bones. The lower part of it is cartilaginous and does not break; rather, it is exposed to bending, twisting, and dislocation.
If one of its halves breaks, it should be your finger that enters the nasal hole and corrects the fracture from inside with your index finger and thumb from outside until you bring the nose back to its natural shape. Do this gently and ensure that no pain is caused to the patient.
If the break is at the top of the nose and your finger did not reach there, you should correct it using a thin, hard edge. If the break affects both sides of the nose, do this similarly, and start to correct it on the first day following the break.
If possible, do this within the first seven or tenth day following a hot tumor's calming down. Then insert into the nasal hole a thread from the cut reed if the break affects one side of the nose, or two threads if it affects both sides.
Let the lump in it be hard according to how much it fills the nostril hole, and some of those who were urged by custom mentioned that the lump should be greased with tallow and replaced every day. I do not see this happening but rather it is recommended that the lump should be greased with a paste made from egg white mixed with charcoal dust.
Then leave the lump until the bone is fixed and cartilage heals, and after placing it in the nostril in place of the lump, there may enter a feather pipe of an owl's tail when wrapped around a soft incision to make its hold as strong as possible to break the nose, and to prevent obstruction of breathing.
This is not something necessary, you can choose to make it as you wish. If the nose is exposed during your work and a hot burn occurs, moisten the nose with camel's urine or cotton dipped in honey and oil, or use something from the dehydroxylation ointment.
If no hot lump appears, it should be moistened from the outside with meal and ground caraway seeds that have been kneaded with egg white, then place a soft paste on top. Do not bind the nose to anything at all, because if the nasal bones break into small pieces.
Or if it disintegrated, it should be cut open and removed with the instrument suitable for that purpose. Then suture the wound and treat it with things that heal and dry out, such as ointments suitable for that. If there is a cut inside the nose, it should be treated with a lump and use lead pipes. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
In correcting the lower jaw if it breaks.
If the lower jaw breaks and it is not a wound, look if the breakage is only from outside and does not break apart in two and goes inside. Its identification becomes easier.
If the fracture is in the right groove, then the left hand's little finger should be inserted into the child's mouth like so. Similarly, if the fracture is in the left groove, then the right hand's little finger should be inserted and gently lifted from inside to outside the breakage.
And the other hand from outside the bone controls its setting. If a fracture of the jaw has split into two, it may be necessary to use the extension on both sides for straightness until its setting is achieved. If it occurred in the teeth, eruption.
Or if it split a band that you hoped would remain made of gold or silver thread, then place on the broken cheek bone the quill, then place on it a bent needle and put on the needle a large tight buckle or a piece of leather shoe equal to the length of the cheek. Then, you should tie it from above according to how your tying appears and conforms to its attachment, so that it does not collapse. Command the patient to avoid movement and stay still, giving them a soft food like dates. If you think there has been any change in appearance on one of their faces, act on this problem on the third day.
Then, you should tie it from above according to how your tying appears and conforms to its attachment, so that it does not collapse. Command the patient to avoid movement and stay still, giving them a soft food like dates. If you think there has been any change in appearance on one of their faces, act on this problem on the third day. Then, correct what you applied with camel hair dust or egg white, or wheat flour after removing the quill from it. Place a soft piece of wet muslin on the pad. As long as that pad sticks to him and does not change for his bone, leave it alone.
Do not fix it until the wound heals and the fracture becomes stronger. This fracture often intensifies within three weeks, if a hot tumor appears, then use what we have mentioned repeatedly for stabilizing it until this tumor goes away.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, observe. If it has cleared of bone碎片 or fragments, use your device to carefully remove those fragments according to what suits you for their removal. If the wound's mouth is narrow, widen it with forceps to the extent that your need demands.
And if you have removed those fragments and there is nothing left, draw a line in the wound's mouth if it is wide. Otherwise, apply one of the poultices that suits for this purpose. And let the wound heal until it clears,
The Fifth Chapter.
In forcing the reunion of bones if they have broken.
The prosthesis often breaks at the front of the knee joint, and if it breaks, it is on one of three aspects. Either it breaks and divides into two without producing fragments, which is easier to realign.
Otherwise, if there are fragments in the break, which is more difficult to realign. Or if the break occurs with a wound, and working on it when the break is not associated with injury requires having two attendants; one of them adjusts the bone that follows the broken prosthesis, while the other extends the neck towards the opposite side.
Then, correct the break with your fingers until it takes on the desired shape without any unevenness or protrusion. If you need to extend more, it would be advisable to place a ball of torn fabric or wool under the buttocks of the patient.
Its bone should be according to your need, and extend the prosthesis, lifting it. Press the ball with your hand until the break is corrected properly, if you can't draw one end of the prosthesis out, as she went deep, it would be necessary for the patient to lie on his back.
A medium cushion is placed under his buttocks. The attendant presses the pillow under his buttocks downwards until the bone of the buttock rises to above. Then, you correct and shape the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the tibia has broken off and is moving, it should be cut through and removed gently. If the fragment is trapped in the bone, you should turn it by one of the cuts prepared for this purpose. After making the tibia into an apparatus that supports the diaphragm, which is an apparatus made of wood or iron, and this is its image:".
It resembles a spoon without a handle, its width is according to the size of the bone, whether it's big or small. And as for its length, it depends on what you can do in work. It should have two ends like you see, one side is wider and the other side is narrower.
If the incision you made when removing a bone fragment is wide and the boil is hot, stitch your wound together. If the incision is minor or if you fear the hot boil, open the wound by scratching it and applying dressings according to how deep the cut was.
If the boil is hot, apply scratching in butter and honey or wine and hold it, as for the bone if it was not from a wound or cut, you should take padding made of dust from the chalk with the white of the egg. You place the soft pressure on it, then you put the ball under his waist if needed. Then take a veil that is very long and its width is a handbreadth or something like that. Then carry a bent rod over the pressure and padding. Then take an iron ring from a thin board. The presentation will be three fingers and so in length as well, then insert it into a notch, followed by placing that notch with the giberka at the place on the cloak which is located over the break. Then pull the cloak onto the break just as one turns. And place it on his neck and under his elbows, and under the patient's elbows, return it repeatedly to each side as you observed that tightening correctly stabilizes the fracture firmly, which is evident to you.
And ensure that the giberka does not come off the broken bone in all cases. Therefore, you should check the plaster every day; if you notice that the giberka has come off, correct it and tighten the bandage again. Then have the patient lie on their back to sleep, and place a small pillow under his elbows when he sleeps at night.
His arm should rise by it from his side, causing the fracture of the humerus to rise in proportion to the lengthening of the bone or she ties his arm to his neck. The bandage is not removed until twelve days have passed if there has been no occurrence of a cut or tumor at the site.
Then renew the dressing if you see any sign of that. Apply the tightening and leave it until the fracture of the humerus sets properly, strengthens and becomes more stable; this is usually around twenty-eight days. And in some cases, it may be less than that for others.
Chapter Six.
In setting a shoulder fracture. If the shoulder breaks at its broad part, it only breaks off from it in a few places; when a place breaks or it breaks in the middle of it, this can be determined by touch. Depending on the shape of the break, you should adjust accordingly.
Apply and set it in its natural shape through every way you can, then carry over the place with camphor dust mixed with the whiteness of egg white and soft olive oil. Place it above a sheet of folded leather, then put a broad piece of board on top.
Apply a strip as long as the whole shoulder or slightly wider, if it's under the board, apply it on one of the shoulder areas. Rub gently to ensure the board settles evenly, then pull tightly from above with a long cloak.
Pull tightly and secure the board so that it doesn't move, check the bandage every day. Each time the bandage relaxes, tighten it again and reshape the board if it has moved from its place. Let the patient lie on his correct side, with the shoulder held in a groove for twenty days.
One day or twenty-four days, when this period is completed, loosen the bandage as you are now safe. These bones do not fear breakage or weakening. If a fragment of bone protrudes and it withers under the skin, cut into it and remove it. Do as was mentioned regarding breaking the bone in stabilizing the hot tumor if such a thing occurs.
Chapter Seven.
Infixing Broken Rib.
The chest can break in the middle, which is less common, and especially its ends are more prone to fracture and displacement. One of its symptoms if it breaks in the middle is that it bends downwards, exposes severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
Perhaps it might cause bleeding, and the displacement in the broken bone becomes evident by touch. The treatment involves having the patient lie on their back with a pillow between their shoulders. Then bending both legs at the knees, gathering all the parts of the ribcage together from both sides, and smoothing out its position as much as possible through every way that can be done.
Agree until the bone regains its应有的 shape, then place a bandage and strain on it, putting a pillow of a matching plank of horn or ivory or similar thing under it in the softness after wrapping it around in a harness. Then, gently bind it around the broken bone to ensure it stays in place. Move the bandage around to various sides and tightly pull it firmly. Then check the bandage at every moment; whenever it relaxes, tighten it again.
And if necessity demands it when there is difficulty or pain or a lump, proceed with the operation. Remove the bandage and repair what has appeared through its method of treatment, then reapply the bandage if you see fit. And bind it firmly until it heals.
The eighth chapter.
In correcting the ribs if they break, you should know that fractures occur in the most prominent areas of the back and its extremities from the front. This is due to their cartilaginous nature. This knowledge is not hidden when inspecting with your hands as it involves a sense understanding.
Correcting it by trying to straighten the break with your fingers on the appropriate face until the shape is as it should be, then bandage and tighten the broken bone with a pillow if necessary. If the rib fracture is inclined inward, it exposes the reason for severe pain.
And squeeze it as if you are squeezing someone who is holding a string because the bone compresses the diaphragm and also causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting large amounts of blood. This makes treatment difficult, and many tricks have been employed at its beginning.
Some say that it is good for the sustenance of one who is fasting to consume what produces fumes and winds, so that his stomach inflates and expands, pushes out the fracture from inside. However, we dislike this in order not to confirm the existence of a hot tumor. If it did not happen, if it did happen, it would increase and confirm it.
Some said that the wound should be filled up and then squeezed strongly, it is similar to measuring but he fears that the filling may be sucked into the wound due to his weakness. Others said it's better to cover the wound with cloth that has been dipped in hot oil.
It should be inserted between the ribs until it fills, then when wrapped around in a circular motion, it becomes flat. Then treat the fasting person with food and medication treatments, if overworking the fasting person is an extreme that he cannot endure. The bone would crush the membrane painfully and it worries us for the fasting person. It is better to cut through the area, expose the broken rib, then place an apparatus under the fractured side which is provided with instructions on how to use it. We should gently break the bone and remove it.
Then we sew the large wound and dress it with bandages until it heals. If there's a hot tumor during this period, act quickly by applying some ointments and place them on the affected area. Also treat the fasting person from inside to calm down the tumor as well.
He should sleep on the side where he feels relief until it heals,.
The Ninth Chapter.
In the treatment of back and neck stiffness.
If it's the neck bones, if a fracture affects them and not much occurs to them, mostly the pregnancy (pregnancy), just as back swellings also. If this happens to someone and you want to know whether they will heal or not. Observe, if I see that his hands have relaxed and numbed, have died and he cannot move them or spread them or grasp with them. If pressing on them or pinching them with a needle does not hurt him, do not feel any pain in them, then know that it is most likely that he has gone blind.
And if he moves them and feels them with pinching and pricking, know that the spine has been relieved and healing occurs. If you encounter such back tremors of this kind and want to know whether it also heals or not.
Look at his legs, if I see that they have relaxed and what happened to them is similar to what happened in the hands. Then, when he lies on his back, wind and feces come out without intention, and when he lies on his stomach, urine comes out without intention. And if he, when lying on his back and wanting to urinate, was unable to do so, know that he is dead. Do not concern yourself with treating him; for the absence of such symptoms would be less severe. The treatment for what happened in this case would be to aim for calming down the hot tumor.
To apply, you should place on the soiled sore some oil of the rose or mixed with cooked chicken intestines. Apply this three times a day until the hot tumor calms down; then carry an absorbent dressing to the spot and tighten it with the bandage, instructing him to rest and make proper decisions.
And he should not sleep except on the side that does not cause him pain until he recovers. If there was a fragment or something that had healed within the bone during pregnancy, it would be necessary to cut into the skin and remove that bone. Then, if the wound is large, gather its edges with suturing. Then, treat it with medicinal plasters until it heals. If the last bone of the elbow breaks which corresponds to the tip of the penis, it should be necessary for the left hand's index finger to enter into the socket.
And straighten the broken bone with the other hand according to what allows and achieves alignment. Then, apply padding and a splint if needed, then tighten it.
If you feel a fragment inside, cut it and remove it; then treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.
The Tenth Chapter.
Incorrecting the fracture of the thigh.
Should any of the pelvic bones break, breaking may occur at their ends and in their length they tend to bend inward. They become vulnerable to suspicion, pain in that location, swelling and numbness in the leg affected by the break.
And correct it by passing your hand over it until you see the fracture as it is. If the break is only at its ends, align this break according to what facilitates alignment for you until it resembles its natural shape.
Should the break be in length or inclined inward, place him on his back until you can correct this break. After aligning it, wrap padding around it then apply a splint made of wood or leather and tighten it firmly.
Don't fear displacement of the break or removal of the splint. Align the protrusion with what fills it until a firm tension is achieved and instruct the patient to lie on his back or correct side, if he feels heat from any tumor.
Release the pressure and apply traction until the hot tumor subsides, then apply what calms it as previously described. Then return to traction and pull as should be fitting. If fragments appear in the bone or break off from its ends, it is not advisable to remove them.
And he does not disturb but smooths from outside as we said, and leaves the tension until it heals.
The eleventh chapter.
In traction, the breaking of the bone.
The shoulder is the area between the scapula and the shoulder blade. If it breaks, traction should be applied on two sides; one of which involves taking a flexible, smooth, somewhat thickened reed in this manner:.
And attach two loops to its ends, then hang it from a high place. The patient should sit on a chair. Then he holds the broken arm against the reed until his elbow sticks in the middle curvature of the reed. Then hangs something heavy above him.
Or, another servant holds him down. Then the doctor corrects the break with both hands until it returns as it should. The other way is for the patient to lie on his forehead and hang his hand from his neck with a loop.
Then order the servants to adjust one of them above the break with his hands and the other below it, extending each to their respective sides. If you want more tension, tighten with a loop under the break and on top of it, and have each servant extend both loops towards themselves.
If the break is near the hip, it should be that the center of the loop is under the elbow and the other under the break towards the shoulder blade. Similarly, if the break is near the shoulder blade, it should be that the loops are at that location and on the shoulder blade itself.
Then the fracture is gently aligned without force until the fracture is properly set and well united. Then, if no tumor appears, strengthen it. If a hot tumor does appear, leave the strength to the seventh day and apply moistened wool soaked in vinegar on it and rub with rose oil.
Until the tumor settles, then strengthen. The method of strengthening is to hold a bandage on the fracture, then wrap it with a new strip of cloth on top of the bandage. Then gather the arm onto its own back, and place their hand open on their knee.
And hold the bandage and strength on the back and arm so that the arm replaces the ribs, unless something prevents you or the broken bone changes in any way. If you fear it might change then use the ribs (referring to artificial bones).
It involves placing a rib directly on the fracture, which is wider and stronger than other ribs. There should be an interdigit width between each rib, and the length of the ribs should correspond to the fracture with an extra three fingers on each side.
Then tighten the strength which I mentioned at the beginning of this section.
It means that your strength should be stronger on the spot of the fracture.
As the fracture becomes more distant, your strength should become less. If you find that the placement of ribs and strength is as we said when stabilizing the member during your time, then do it accordingly.
And if you fear the hot tumor, leave the strength and ribs until the seventh day as we said. Then examine the bandage every three days to ensure there is no scratching or swelling in the area, nor does food refuse access to the body due to excessive tightness. All of this will be corrected according to what we have mentioned.
If you are confident that nothing will happen, then do not remove the bandage until a long time has passed. During this period, have the patient lie on his back with his hands on his stomach and place a cushion under his shoulder blade filled with wool of moderate size.
And examine at all times, whether during the day or night, so as not to deform the shape of the broken member or cause the bandage to loosen. All this must be corrected through your efforts. Ensure that the patient's diet is of the quality we recommended: light food initially until the bone starts to heal more strongly.
His diet should be enriched, for it is customary for the shoulder and leg to strengthen after forty days. At that point, he should begin using baths and treatments suitable for that stage. If the break was severe, then appropriate treatment should be applied.
Do not remove the bandage for him until it has been fifty days or two months.
The Second Chapter.
In setting a broken arm.
The arm is made up of two bones, known as the humerus and the radius. The former is smaller and lies above the thumb while the latter is larger and located beneath the smaller one at the bottom. It may be that only the major radius broke, or just the smaller radius, or both broke together.
If the smaller radius above broke, setting it is easier and noticing its correct position happens faster. If the lower radius broke, the break was bad to see and even worse if both bones broke together. And if the bone that broke was the smaller radius above.
When setting the arm, the doctor should make the process gentle and gradual so that it is corrected properly. If it's the larger radius that broke, the process should be more strenuous. If both radii are broken, then the procedure should be extremely strong.
It is necessary that the shape of the hand be placed at the elevation and extension on a pillow, with the thumb raised above all the fingers. The wrist should be lower than the rest of the fingers, and the palm should be laid flat on itself in a stable position.
Let the pillow be at his height so that the palm does not bear the burden of the wrist.
Then, the attendant of the arm extends it either from below with his hand or with a bandage and another attendant extends it from above in the same manner. Then, the doctor smoothes the bone until he can return it to the best form possible. If there are fragments in the bone fracture, they should be removed.
For each fragment, make every effort to place it back in its rightful position. If there appears a clean fragment and the skin is retracting but you don't have any intention of realigning it with force, cut into it according to the method we described before and remove it. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then it has been given a separate chapter.
Treatment for this begins from here; if you encounter a hot tumor in your first operation, apply an incision with the tool treated with rose oil and white beeswax. Make it medium-thick between the thickness and smoothness. Gently pull on the incision until the tumor settles.
Remove the tool and apply a pad made from dust of rhodium mixed with the whites of eggs, then lift the bones. The bone that is placed directly on the fracture should be slightly wider and stronger. Know that there will usually be seven bones in the arm.
If the fracture was within one hook or both together, then make your pulling force on the position of the fracture stronger and harder. As you pull up or down with the pull, let it lean slightly to the side as was mentioned in the first chapter.
Let the sutures that surround the fracture be wet and soft, not too hard. Use a special type of string made from goat's hair to tighten it, positioned halfway between the bone fragments as described before. Then inspect the limb and ligaments after some days.
If something needs to be fixed, such as a sore that appears in the body, it would be necessary to wash the body with warm water until the sore subsides. Let the body remain loose for one night to rest, then continue the tightening afterwards.
If the tightening has relaxed and the bone has moved or somewhat done so, fix all of that with effort, and also observe if food is being prevented from reaching the body due to excessive tightening. It would be necessary to slightly relax it and leave it for a few days until the food can reach there again, then tighten it afterwards.
If there's no reason for the illness as we mentioned, it should not heal except after twenty days or about that. Then tie the ill person to their neck and let their arm be in a moderate position, conserve their effort from chaotic movements, and have them sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture in the arm is expected to heal within thirty days or perhaps twenty-eight, and it might take as long as twenty-one days; all depends on the conditions of fluids and strength.
The Thirteenth Chapter.
In the correction of hand wrist and finger fractures.
Wrist splints and the tendons of fingers rarely suffer from fractures, rather it is often the wrist that does. When the wrist or palm gets a fracture.
In order for the patient to sit up and have a chair in front of him for stability.
Then he places his hand on it stretched out. Then the attendant extends the broken bone and the doctor adjusts it until it is properly aligned. When this is done, it may be necessary to carry the bandage and the exertion if there is no hot swelling. Then a dressing is applied from above according to the position.
And if I have included it in a soft splint, then if the fracture is downwards towards the underside of the hand, make a semi-ball shape with the splint and ask the patient to hold onto it with his broken hand. Then tighten with a long splint.
And the dressing should be made of a soft skin, so that it can adhere to the bending of all parts of the hand. If the fracture is outward, then the dressing should be from above and another one from below in the palm, so that the hand will be open upright.
Then hold the bandage as if you are turning the hand, and tie it between the fingers with a strap. If the fracture is across one of the fingers joints, then if it's the thumb, adjust it to where it should be, then tighten together with the palm. And if you want to make him an upright small dressing for straightening the fracture.
And do not move it if the fracture is across all other fingers like the middle finger or ring finger, or wrist or carpal bone. Adjust and tie with the next correct finger or tie them all properly - this would be better - or place a small upright dressing on it.
As we said for the thumb, inspect while you immobilize and keep it away from any hot swellings. Meet such occurrences with what is required, whenever anything like this happens following a recitation of his symptoms.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
In the levering of breaking the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is broken very often and becomes apparent to the touch because it moves forward and backward. Levering can be done by pulling a band over the break and another one under the break, with the legs on his face.
Then each slave stretches the band to his side in accordance with this if the break is in the middle of the bone. But if it's close to the thigh's origin, it should be stretched a tight band either from wool or similar materials.
At the origin of the thigh towards the elbow, the stretch is upwards and the other band is under the break. If the break is near the knee, let the band be close to the knee with the stretch downwards. Then, the surgeon corrects the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural shape.
The bone heals properly then when that occurs, the bandage and pressure should be applied unless there is an inflamed lump on the member. If a lump appears, leave it for days until the hot lump subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for the pressure, it should be placed on the break with a thick and wide band multiple times, leaving what's desired from it. Then place the leg until the heel is at the thigh's origin, then insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg close to the knee from below, making the ends of the thread come above from both sides.
Then twist the rest of the band around the leg and thigh, then place splints at the break position on the hip. Make one splint on the bone of the leg, then fill the gap between the hip and leg with soft plaster to ensure the pressure is even.
Then begin by pulling strongly from the center towards the break site for three or four windings. As you move further away from the break, your pull should become weaker and smoother.
Then, extend to both ends of the thread you were inserting between the thigh and shin. Tie it onto the bones above then move both ends of the thread downwards until they reach the ankle; also pull tightly the ends of the bones on the other side.
To ensure the band doesn't move from its place, keep the pull on it until no discussion arises about the limb or tumor or swelling and such. If anything happens in that regard, take action immediately to resolve it, fixing everything that has gone wrong according to what we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a splinter inside the bone causing decay, it should be smoothed out if possible. If not, cut and remove it, then treat the wound as previously described until it heals. This may resolve the break in the thigh without needing to include the shin bones.
As we mentioned for the ribcage and arm, except that his support does not make him debility in the event of a lift; if it was only strengthened without including the leg, then she who owns it will inevitably always lift forever.
And know that the thigh will strengthen over fifty days, or perhaps a little more or less, all of which varies depending on the nature of the food and other conditions.
The fifteenth chapter.
In the case of breaking the kneecap.
The kneecap is rarely affected by fractures, but the patella can be subjected to many blows. If it is broken, it could either be a crack or a break in its parts, which may occur with or without injury.
This stands all of that by sense, and strengthens it by making to adjust what separates from its parts with fingers until they gather and connect as far as the adjustment and care and perfection can enable, then she holds the bandage and supports it with a rotating weight if needed.
You pull from above the corresponding tension, then reconcile all situations described in other fractures such as the hot tumor and similar ones by meeting each symptom with what suits it until recovery occurs.
The sixteenth chapter.
In the correction of thigh fracture.
The thigh bone consists of two bones, one is thick and it's called the thigh bone, while the other is thin and it's called the tibia. There are various types of fractures that affect either of these bones. Therefore, the treatment for a broken leg is similar to that of an arm; if both bones in the leg break, the leg turns in all directions. If only the thinner bone breaks, the leg turns forward. If the thicker bone in the lower part of the leg breaks, it's something obvious that you should see.
Use stretching, adjustment and ligament tying according to this method; however, if the leg fracture is very large with many fragments, the stretching should be less and lighter. Apply your effort in moderation during correction.
In the leg, there is an additional aspect compared to the arm; if you have adjusted the ligaments and completed all your work, take two scaly sticks of juniper wood that are used for flattening rooms placed between the grooves of plates or can be from banana leaves or similar.
Choose from them what is slightly thick and not made of thin strands, let its length be equal to the length of the leg from the knee down. Then wrap each one with two winding strings along their lengths, place one string around the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let it be from the knee down to the ankle, then bind the femoral ligaments in three places on both ends and the middle. In this way, you prevent the leg from bending left or right and properly immobilize it. It may also use a strap of wood along the length of the leg.
And it should be placed to keep him from movement and more importantly, if he has a special wound in the fracture, you need to check his leg every day with great care for any swelling or puffing up or anything like that. If something of that sort happens, deal with it in what is appropriate until it heals. The swelling of the leg is forced to subside within thirty days or about that time.
The seventeenth chapter.
In the case of fractures of the leg bones and the fingers.
As for the heel, it does not sustain fractures of the phalanx. As for bones in the leg, fractures do occur to them and also to the fingers. Rarely does a fracture happen to them; rather, they usually get hurt due to pressure.
If a fracture occurs to the leg bones and you see that some of these bones are pressing against each other, let him put his foot on the ground vertically like a donkey. Then place your foot on what has risen from these bones and press it down firmly and smooth it out.
Until they return to their places, then carry the bandage and pressure from above by placing under the sole of the foot a small board having two flat ends. Then pull the foot tightly with it after wrapping around with thongs or ropes and all that you need.
And if three or four days have passed, release the bandage. You will find that the bones are level but broken or fractured; do as you see fit, and regarding breaking of some fingers, force them and smooth them out according to what I described for you in forcing fingers of the hand.
Then make the broken finger bandage along the entire length of the finger and slightly apart from it. Then place under the foot this plate that I described to you and tighten it tightly. If the broken bones are two or three or more.
Make a bandage on each finger with its length matching the width of an ivory comb, and place the plate under the foot. Let each head of my plate stick out slightly from the sole of the foot to properly set it.
And you should not forget to adhere to all that we have discussed with you regarding other fractures of the symptoms that we mentioned, and respond to each symptom as it arises.
The eighteenth chapter.
In the case of a woman's pelvis fracture and the man's hip bone, he mentioned.
When the vulva of a woman breaks, make her sit upright. Then bend it slightly towards her back and hold it from behind. Then insert cotton into her vulva until it fills it up and becomes like a ball inside her.
Then, shake the woman gently and raise her spine slightly. This cotton will come out until it reaches near her vulva like a ball, causing the bone fracture to heal. Then she should have a splint on her back. If she wishes to urinate, she removes the cotton gently before passing urine.
And return it in the same way you introduced it first, then resume your splint. Do this for seven days or approximately that period because it will heal. If you wish, you can take a sheep bladder, stretch its mouth with an iron tube, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Then inflate the pipe with strength until the bladder inflates inside her vulva, causing the fracture to heal. Then fill it with cotton and maintain that for as long as we've described until she is healed. As for when the hip bone breaks in a man or woman, he uses it for healing.
And complete what we described about the bone of the hip, and there is no hidden mistake in this strange fractures which seldom happen especially to those who have some experience and understand my book well because the fracture itself indicates you most often.
On the path of righteousness in balancing and tightening, understand, and if a man breaks his member, take an ostrich egg shell, insert the penis into it then wrap it with strips from a thorny bush and tie it, leaving it for three days or roughly that duration until it heals.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In the case of balancing fractures when accompanied by a wound.
It is necessary for those who have a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large such as the thigh bone or the elbow bone or similar ones, to promptly deal with it from its time, assuming that you were helped by the conditions of the fracture as we presented.
If the wound bleeds, it is necessary to promptly cut it by rubbing a powdered substance on it if there's nothing else that can stop it. Then you should balance the fracture on that day without delaying it.
If no hot swelling occurs, and if a hot swelling does occur, leave it for balancing until the ninth day until the hot swelling subsides. Do not come close to it on the third and fourth days though as it might cause bad symptoms.
If the broken bone is exposed on the skin, it should be repositioned and corrected by your hands gently and in a mild manner. If you are unable to do so with your hands alone, you may use this device; it's made of iron and its length is about seven or eight fingers long. Display it according to the size of the wound.
Therefore, the doctor should take three or four of them according to what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture. Let it be twisted where there is a slight stiffness so that it does not bend when rubbed upon during work.
And it should have a sharp tip with a smooth edge on its tip, and the upper part should be slightly rough while the lower half is extremely fine. This is how it looks:.
It is called in Greek 'perim' because they prefer a small obstacle. It should have a sharp curved tip on the bone and push it once until the bone returns, becomes somewhat leveled, and then place each fracture end over another to settle them together.
If its broken end is soft and the machine did not take it properly, it may be necessary to cut off that bone tip so that the machine can get hold of it. If you are unable to return the bone as described, cut it like one of the cuts mentioned.
Or spread it out with one of the splints as best you can, then remove any roughness and thin layers from the bone. If after returning the bone you find intense pain indicating that something is wrong, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to return it to its natural position, do so. You will greatly benefit the patient, and once you have completed setting the bone, immerse a nail in a tight black drink especially if it's summer. Do not place any bandage on the wound nor anything that contains oil.
In order to prevent fungus and decay, use the splints when you're not setting the bones, leave the wound exposed by cutting with scissors in loops a hole according to the size of the wound during breaks from setting the bones.
Be extremely cautious not to pull the wound with the fracture too much. Often, unskilled doctors do this, causing either death or complication in their patients. Let our pulling be gentle and different from the pulling of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or it's a large wound and I fear some of the bad symptoms that we described, where he finds pain in the area that is spreading, it should not be expected to put on splints. Instead, make him bandages from hard perforated material in place of the splints and pull with them.
If after one or two days you notice that the wound is starting to produce pus, remove the gauze that was placed on him using a wet compress. Then use the ointments and remedies we usually apply to wounds like the four-ingredient ointment and similar ones. It's advisable for you to change the bandage.
Inspect the wound every morning and evening until it heals completely. It should be positioned so that pus can easily flow downwards. If the wound has been around for many days without healing or without the pus stopping, you should know there are small fragments of bone inside.
You should inspect the wound with a probe. If there are any of those small fragments still present, remove and extract them. If they were not removed, and the limb was withering and causing pain, remove and extract all possible pieces in any way you can do it safely.
If the wound shows signs of infection, decay or any other form of corruption and contamination, it should be treated with a remedy that corresponds to these symptoms as described in its respective section.
And from what I should insist on mentioning and consider in your mind if a large bone, such as the thigh bone or the backbone, breaks inside the body part like those major organs, you should not expose yourself to pulling it or removing it. The excerpt translates to: "Many times it results in death, so I let him remain until he discharges himself, and perhaps he will resolve after twenty days or thirty.
When then, treat the wound if I see a place for treatment, and otherwise leave it alone.
The twenty-first chapter.
In treating the complication that appears after some fractures.
This complication often occurs following fracture healing, especially in joints where it can deform the appearance of the limb and possibly prevent its normal function.
If the complication is of a soft nature, use medications that contract such as camphor, milk, ginger, snail slime, and similar substances. Take some or all of these, mix them with a grippy drink, egg white, or vinegar.
And apply the remedy to the complication with difficulty, pull it tight on it very strongly and leave the pulling for many days without releasing it. Then release it and repeat this process until the complication goes away if God willing, or fasten a sheet of tightly polished lead over it.
Lead has the property of removing whatever is stuck in organs. If the complication had hardened and intensified, causing the need to remove it, cut into it from above and remove or cut off the protruding part with some bits of paper until it goes away and treat the wound until it heals.
The twenty-first chapter.
In treating fractures where the bone has been forced and afterward, the limb remains thin unlike its original state.
If the bones have been fractured and afterward, the limb remains thin and weak, this can be due to many reasons. One of these is either an excess in loosening ligatures and attaching them improperly, or excessive tension on the ligatures until food cannot pass to the organ, or an excess in exaggerated tying, or movements that occur at wrong times, or a lack of blood within the fasting person's body leading to its weakness.
The treatment for this is to feed the fasting person and enrich his body so that there's an abundance of blood within him. He should use baths, and water treatments while also bringing joy and happiness to him. Then lifting the hump on the organ could attract much food towards it or maintain its saturation with lukewarm water. Until the food flows within him and returns to its natural state.
The twenty-first chapter.
In treating broken bones if the cast is forced, and prevented from functioning as it should.
When an organ appears after release if it has been distorted due to the correction of a broken bone or tangled, so its image was affected by that. However, if the organ has not ceased its natural function, it is not appropriate to accept the claim of those who assert that they break the organ from head, and many ignorant doctors and enforcers were doing this in our country.
This act is severely condemned, leading to great harm and discomfort. However, if the twist and tightness are slight, it should be treated with water that has been boiled with relaxing herbs like mint leaves, its root, and crown of the king among others.
It is treated with relaxing powders like the compactly made Dihajlun or sucking on the root of mint and mixing it with chicken fat and anus oil, then applying it. Or taking dates with beaten hen's dung and other medicines known as anti-contracting ones.
The reduction of complexity is achieved through constant, gentle rubbing with the hands. Movement of the body parts to every direction at all times helps if deformity has appeared and worsened, becoming rigid; in such cases, it becomes necessary to treat it with iron.
Above all, you should cut upwards and break the connection of the bones. You should remove or cut off what is preferred from complexity or bones with cuts in a smooth way, while being careful and gentle during this process. Then treat the wound according to what has been mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is a joint that, when it exits its place and gets dislocated, impedes movement and spoils the appearance of the member. It causes intense pains and sufferings to the patient. Whenever someone's jaw gets dislocated, it should be treated promptly by returning it to its position.
There should be no hesitation in dealing with it, because if one delays and allows the place to swell up and become stiff, it makes it harder to return the jaw. Therefore, there shouldn't be any delay, movement or extension while it's swollen as this often causes the patient discomfort and pain.
However, if this occurs, it should be treated promptly with separating the jaw. Allow it to rest until swelling subsides a little bit then immerse it in hot water and apply oil before gently returning it. Treat each part according to what has been mentioned for its place.
The chapters on the jaw have also been arranged according to what precedes in breaking from above the body to below it.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In treating the removal of the lower beard.
Remove only the chin hairs when they are rare, and their removal occurs on two conditions: either they come off gently from their places in a slight process of relaxation, or they fall out completely until they relax. Up to the chest so that saliva from hunger flows and he cannot hold it, and he cannot endure applying brakes to his speech and the tongue rolls with talking. And if his removal is slight, then in most cases he returns to himself with the easiest thing.
And if the removal is complete, it should be hastened immediately and not delayed. It's that you should hold a servant of hunger, and enter one of the doctor's fingers in the root of the beard inside his mouth if the beard is from one side.
Or both of his thumbs if the beard is from both sides, and all his fingers except one outside adjusting it, he orders hunger to relax its beard and release for going in every direction. And the doctor adjusts the beard and pushes until it returns to its place.
If it is hard to get a response from him, especially if the beard is all together, then use cloths dipped in hot water and grease until they make his reply easier. Do not delay their response as we said. When they return, they align, and the mouth of hunger is closed without relaxing. Then, put on them stoppers for piercing, with a quill made from beeswax and grease that has been prepared.
Then, tie him gently with a loose bandage. Hunger should sleep on his back, and his head is cushioned between two cushions so that he's not moved to the right or left. He shouldn't have to chew anything; instead, he should eat light food for nourishment.
Even if the pain goes away and the jaw contracture occurs, let him eat whatever seems fit to him. Use this with caution; do not overburden his opening of mouth during eating, drinking, or sniffling until the jaw contracture sets in and he is relieved.
If the jaws fail to return after they have loosened for a while and do not return to their original places, many conditions like fevers and constant headaches may occur. Sometimes, the stomach might rupture or vomiting could happen repeatedly out of no reason. If you see this, know that there is an injury.
Many people die from this condition within ten days.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In the return of the jaw in the case of tusk dislocation and the ankle end.
If it's the tusk, it doesn't detach from the inner side due to its connection with the chest. It might detach outward, and this can be sensed by touch. Its treatment involves having the patient lie on his back and stretch out his arms.
Then press the position with your hand firmly. It usually returns then, put a pad and bandages on it, tighten them. As for its part that follows the ankle and is connected to it, it doesn't detach except in rare cases; if it does detach, it should return and be adjusted as we mentioned and what you have prepared.
Then put bandages and bandaging tools on it, and order the patient to stay still and rest until they recover. Through this treatment, the ankle end may return if it too moves from its place.
The twenty-sixth chapter.
In addressing the removal of the spur.
Know that the spur only splits in three directions, one is to detach towards the instep downwards and the second is to detach towards the chest perhaps even upwards from the spur. This happens rarely.
It does not split towards the back of the shoulder region nor forward to the spinal nerve. The spur is more likely to detach and come out downwards towards the instep, especially in those with little flesh because it comes out quickly and goes in quickly.
As for those with ample flesh, it is different; they have difficulty in both removing and reinserting the spur, and sometimes even faint due to a blow or fall causing swelling of the spur which feels hot leading them to believe that the spur has detached. It would be advisable to test its validity before concluding its health condition.
In such a case, treatment proceeds for its cure. Once the detachment is identified as downwards towards the instep, if it occurs between the deformed spur and the correct spur, you will find an apparent difference between them; you will notice that there's an irritation at the tip of the spur when touched and under the ankle, it feels like a small egg.
The invalid cannot lift his hand to his ear, nor can he perform all movements. Similarly, if the spur detaches towards the chest or upwards, you will find it clearly evident under touch.
This type of spur might be easier to remove if it is soft or if the invalid is a child. The removal procedure involves having an attendant lift his hand upwards, then you place your fingers under his ankle and lift the joint upwards to its position while he lifts his hand upwards.
Then, he should place it downwards, for it returns quickly. If it does not return as mentioned and the jaw has been affected by illnesses for many days, it may be necessary to bathe the patient in hot water and use laxatives that relax and soften like boiling carob beans, dates, and the crown of a king in water and using them.
Then the patient lies on his back. A ball of wool is placed under his elbows, one that is moderate between softness and strength. Then the doctor places himself behind this ball and holds the hand of the patient with his hand, extending it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, so it returns to its place. If you wish, you can repeat this by having a longer leg than the patient and stopping him on one side of his body, placing your buttock under his elbow, and raising his elbow up until the patient is hanging in the air. Another servant pulls down the hand of the patient with his buttocks. If the patient is light, it may be necessary to attach another object to him to weigh him down. In either case, he returns his jaw from its position, and it can also return on another face.
It is to focus on the ground a long piece of wood, which head is round like the tip of a bow, neither too thick nor too thin. Then it is placed under the elbow of the patient after you make a small hole at the top of the wooden stick and the patient stands along the entire length of the wood.
Then he extends his hand downwards from the other side and also extends his body strongly from the other side. The joint returns to its place quickly, if it is hard to return with all what we mentioned use this treatment; you should take a piece of wood whose length is about two arms. The translation of the excerpt is: "Displaying it the size of four fingers and making it thick the size of two fingers, it should have a round head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the wrist on this picture.
Then, it pierces the soft hole on the round head so as not to damage the inner wood. Then, it goes underneath the wrist and extends the whole arm downwards onto the wood. It ties the wood on the back and elbow, and ends at the end of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a stand. Step across and extend the hand downwards, leaving the rest of the body suspended from the other side. The joint should enter from its socket, and upon any way possible it might have entered, one ought to place a moderate-sized ball of wool underneath the wrist.
Then, the prepared poultice made of clay dust with frankincense, myrrh and the white of egg is placed all over the thigh as it rotates from above. Then, the ball is pulled firmly from underneath the knee and the bandage is wrapped around the poultice from above, attaching his hand to his neck.
Then, the person is left not to move their hand for seven days. It should be that he has a very small amount of food for the weakened body so that the muscle can strengthen; it heals faster this way. After seven days or five, exercise is done with movement. If it's established and there's no relaxation, then the person is healed.
If the joint repeatedly dislocates due to moisture or another cause, it should be used in three pieces of the treatment as described under the chapter on dislocation. If this is done for everything and the bandage is released after seven days but the joint does not stabilize.
It was necessary to apply the bandage and pull on it several times, but it did not set and fell off. Then, it relaxed and could not lift it up above. Realize that the nerve in the stump's head may have been cut or stretched or relaxed. Realize then that the joint will never remain in its place permanently.
And as for the jaw that is towards the chest and breastbone, and behind it moves backwards by pushing and pulling with hands until it returns. It uses all kinds of tightening and treatment until it heals. If after recovery there appears a body within the organ and its movement is slower.
And the remedy should use steam baths repeatedly until that mass softens and returns to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
In treating the shoulder joint.
The shoulder joint separates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty. It separates to all directions, especially forward or backward. Its separation is not hidden from you because it occurs under observation and touch, to whatever shape it separates.
And when you compare the separated shoulder to the correct one, it becomes clear to you an obvious explanation with respect to the dislocation of the joint. It cannot bend the arm or touch its buttocks. It is necessary for you to quickly and return the dislocated segment before it presents itself to a hot swelling.
And if it presents itself to a hot swelling, he will find it difficult to return it and perhaps may not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is behind. This is the worst among all types of dislocations and it causes great pain and many times death occurs with it.
To perform the reduction, if it is possible for it to be reduced, have a servant hold both his arms with both hands and spread them wide. The doctor holds one of his hands above the shoulder and below him, pushing all fingers of his two hands together until he can return it to its place or by the base of his palm until he can return it to its place.
And if the jaw reaches up to the nose, it may be treated by bending one's hand twice until it strikes against her bent palm which follows him, and if the jaw does not return with this method then use extreme strong pull of the arm being held in place.
The assistant also holds on to the patient's arms so that they don't move when pulling, then swing the arm back and forth after wrapping it with a folded cloth or wide carpet. If the surgeon doctor begins rubbing his dislocated joint with oil, he is making it easier to realign the joint smoothly.
Then, the joint is pushed with a strong force until it returns. Afterwards, it should be held with a bandage that contains squeezing and drying, along with the white of an egg. The arm should be firmly tightened to the neck of the assistant and left for days.
If the joint has stayed in its place, release the bandage and leave it. If I see that the joint did not tighten properly, reapply the bandage and let it for more days until it tightens then remove it. Should anything happen to him after the return of his joint and removal of the bandage.
And if it's difficult to move, they should use steaming in the bath and gentle rubbing with massage until it softens or make a fat camel's leather over the joint then tie it on him for a day and night. Then remove it and have him enter the bath again. If he sweats, scrub the joint gently as usual.
Then, apply the leather to him three times with entering the bath until it softens. If you wish, cover him with fresh wet animal tallow mixed with fat and tighten it on him. Do this several times; he will soften and return to his original state.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
In treating the dislocation of the elbow.
The elbow, which is often dislocated, frequently gets out of place. When it does need to be repositioned, this task is easier compared to other joints; however, when the elbow is dislocated before being returned to its proper position or while it's hot after an injury, one should hasten its return.
Repositioning the elbow involves placing the hand of the sick person on a board, stretching their arm, and having the attendant hold it. The doctor then places his hand on the joint and pushes until it returns to place, but it should be checked whether the dislocation has moved towards the palm of the hand.
The sick person should place the front of their hand on the board when stretching and retracting. If the dislocation is sticking out on the surface of the hand, they should have the bottom side of their hand on the board so that the doctor's hand can be placed right above the joint. If it returns immediately, otherwise, apply pressure with a poultice for pain relief.
Leave him alone and do not make him attempt it again, as he cannot bear it or manage its repositioning after a few days. The joint will stay out of place but does not harm the sick person unless his hand relaxes and is unable to hold anything.
Then, you will know that the nerve has been severed or there is nothing left to do about it except for tying with a sling. It may help or not at all. Once the elbow is returned into place, apply the poultice described then have them rest and keep their arm up for five days.
Then he should help and train the hand. If movement in the elbow proves difficult or if there is a piece of bone exposed, he should warm it with hot water and steam until it softens.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In the treatment of breaking fingers.
The fingers may break in every direction. When one breaks towards the back or palm of the hand, extend your finger and push on it with your thumb until it returns to its original position. Then tie the tip of the finger and hang it toward the side where it broke off.
Leave it for two days, then release and stretch it until it stabilizes. If it was done at night, tie it in the same way; it will continue to improve during the day. It is exercised by movement during the day and tied at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Similarly, you should do it with the hand if the finger broke towards the palm. You tie it in the direction of that side and follow your first action until it recovers. Similarly, do this for her when she breaks in other directions.
The Thirty-first Chapter.
In the treatment of breaking ribs.
If a rib or neck bone breaks, or if the complete breaking occurs, or if many ribs are removed from their places, there is no cure for it because death will hasten.
This is indicated by the urine of a sick person being discharged involuntarily, unable to hold it back. It often relaxes some of its members, either his legs or arms or both. If one rib was removed from its place, it often happens that another will be removed.
The removal of the rib to four directions will be called a galea. As for its treatment, if the galea occurred during childhood, there is no cure in it or from it completely. However, if it occurred due to falling, hitting, and similar incidents.
I have mentioned them in various forms of treatment with lengthy language that is not always beneficial. I have shortened this, providing the essential information and eliminating much of what they brought based on understanding their meaning, explaining it to them and illustrating the device differently than how they indicated and explained it.
I say that the swelling which occurs in front of the chest has no remedy and cannot be protected from it, similarly affecting both sides. Only the one occurring in the back is treated specifically as I am describing it, which involves placing the patient's face downwards.
At a level khan (a kind of stand) near a wall, spread out under it a damp mat so as not to harm his chest. Then place a standing board buried in a hole in the ground at one end of the khan towards his head and another wooden plank at the other end towards his feet on the opposite side of the khan.
And a servant holds the plank and let it not be securely fastened in the hole. And another servant holds the other plank at this manner. Then wrap it around his chest and below his elbow with a thin, smooth cloth and extend the cloth to the plank near his head and tie him there.
Then tighten another cloth above his hips and knees, and around his buttocks. Then gather all the straps together and tie them to the other plank near his feet. Afterwards, each servant tightens their plank with the strap. Do not remove the two planks from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not firmly placed as we said. The doctor puts his hands on the pin with force until it moves, or places a plank on top of it and leans against the plank with his legs until it moves. If this treatment does not work, take a plank whose length is about three arms long.
Excavate in the wall which we said should be near the elbow, where a corner of the plate enters. Then place the middle part of the plate on the crease and places his doctor's legs on the other end and pulls with great strength until it presses the carpal bone.
And return it to its place, and if you wish to make it with the rod that twists in your hand - which is to pierce the ground at the elbow's end of the mallet with two pieces of wood of one arm length, and also at his feet at the end of the mallet as well with another two pieces of wood.
And let there be a span between each piece of wood. Each piece of wood should have a hole in it for the rod to pass through. The pieces of wood are deeply anchored into the ground so tightly that they do not move, using a reed which is wound around them at the holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its end, there is a hole that has been anchored in with a reed of one span long which is wound around it. In the other two pieces of wood, this is done similarly. Then pull the band that you tightened on the elbow's mallet near his head and the bands that are tightened on his legs near his feet.
Then he stands in front of each rod where the doctor twists his hand with the twisted stick that is wound around the rod, and the surgeon places the crease on what we have provided. This is a depiction of the mallet, the hammer, and the elbow:
And after the scab has returned and the position is leveled, it should be advisable to carry the dried bandage with the whiteness of egg whites. Then apply exertion, and place above the bandage a piece from the plate which is three fingers wide or slightly more. The length should match what fits for the crease.
On certain correct stones, then they are bound with the appropriate bandage and use gentle food as medicine until they heal. If some remnants remain in place even after healing, it is necessary to use medicines that relax and soothe, while using the board we described for a long time.
And in this case, you may use a lead plate. Sometimes there might be a remnant at the end of back surgery scars, one might think it is peeling off, but it could be excess bone that has not been removed. It should not be treated with such remedies as it might lead to death.
The thirty-first chapter.
In treating dislocated hips.
Be aware that the hip joint and the knee joint are only affected by dislocation, not by minor wear or swelling like other joints. The hip joint can be dislocated on four sides.
That is, it can dislocate towards inside and outside, as well as in front and behind. However, it more often dislocates towards inside than towards front or back. The sign of internal dislocation is that if you compare the sound leg with the diseased one, the diseased one will appear longer.
The knee is usually on the diseased side, and the healthy person cannot bend his leg at the hip joint. The position behind the hip joint is clear and distinct before the thigh bone has reached there.
Indications for dislocation to the outside are symptoms opposite these, and indications for dislocation towards front show that he spreads his leg completely until it bends without pain in the knee. If he tries to walk straight ahead, he cannot do so.
The urinary control is affected and when walking, he feels pain in his heels. A sign of someone who has undergone jaw surgery is that they cannot fully extend their knee or bend it before the bending of the curvature, and also has a shorter leg compared to the other.
The curvature is relaxed, and the thigh bone can be seen at the place of the backbone clearly. As for the types that require this surgery, if you look and find that the jaw has been worn out with its owner and he didn't try to restore it and remained in his condition, there's no cure for toothache.
It should not be subjected to surgery, and as for the one whose jaw was recently broken regardless of which type it belonged to among the four types of jaws, he should start by rotating the joint, extending it inwards and outwards, moving it right and left. It may happen.
He returned and did not need any other treatment. If he doesn't return in this way, it should be that he has two strong attendants who can extend his leg from below either with their hands or with a girth tied above the knee on his leg. Another attendant should also help him from above.
He should insert his hands under his elbows, then pull with a soft girth at the top of the thigh and hold onto one end of the girth. Another third attendant would be there, extending him either forward from the area of curvature to the front or backwards towards the back, depending on the condition.
All of them should extend him once each time so that the patient raises his body from the ground and remains suspended. This type of extension is a common feature among the four types. If the jaw returns as we have described, or otherwise, it becomes necessary for every kind of treatment specific to what I mentioned.
If the jaw is retracted inward, it should be necessary for the patient to lie on their correct side and place pillows under the hip joint between the buttock and the place below the iliac crest.
Then, the band is extended upwards from the iliac crest towards the upper body and to the side of the chest. Then another nurse takes hold with his hands and embraces the thick part of the reclinable hip while extending it as far as possible. He then returns to its place.
This type is easier than other treatment types that require this member to retract, if you are unable and refuse to proceed with this type of treatment, then it should be necessary to bind all the legs of the reclining person with a strong, soft band around the ankles and knees.
Each one of its (the reclining person's) companion is four fingers apart, and the reclinable leg is extended more than the others by two fingers. Then, the reclining person is hung on a beam in the house, which is about two arms' length from the ground.
Then, command a strong slave to embrace the hip and have another slave hold the reclining person. The slave who holds the hip is pushed with strength by the other slave, thus the joint returns quickly to its place. If retraction is inward, it follows similarly.
It should be necessary for the reclining person to lie on the stretcher as described with respect to the patient in the vessel. The band should be tightened around his reclinable leg specifically and on his chest. Then, two planks are placed, one under his feet and another at his head. A longer plank is put in the middle of the stretcher firmly attached.
If he wet bandages so as not to harm the patient, making the wood (of his legs) between his thighs in order not to be pulled down when stretching, then each slave stretches towards his side and the doctor adjusts the thigh with his hands; if it answered going back.
Otherwise, place the board and secure it as we described in the gynecological section. It should be noted that it is preferable for the patient to lie on his correct side, and if the removal is towards the front, it would be appropriate to extend the patient's leg once while lying on this exact description on the examination table.
The doctor places his right hand on the pubic area of the patient, then presses it with the other hand, and in doing so extends the pressure downwards towards the knee. If the removal is to the back, it would not be appropriate for the patient to extend downward.
He should be raised on the ground, it is preferable to place him on something solid. As well, both his legs should extend outward as described in our instructions for lying on the examination table when he is facing forward, and the bandages are tightly secured.
As we mentioned earlier, it is necessary to use the splint on the position where the joint came out. If the hip joint returns as it should, and the sign of its return will not be hidden from you, which is that both legs of the patient extend.
If you see them at the same level and the patient clenches and stretches his legs without pain, know that the limb has returned as it should. Then unite the thighs and hold the dressing, pulling tightly with a grip that doesn't allow the thigh to move in any direction.
The duration of immobilization is three or four days, then the bandage and dressing are changed. If you see them equal in size, know that the fracture has set, and allow for walking by removing the cast. If you observe any relaxation within it,
Return and re-bandage it according to your initial tightness, leaving it for three days also. Then remove it; allow walking on them for days until they strengthen sufficiently, if God wills.
The Second and Third Chapters.
In treating a dislocated knee.
The knee joint dislocates in three ways: forwards and backwards, laterally inwards and outwards, downwards towards the back. It does not dislocate in front of the patella. The sign of its dislocation is to command immobilization for walking on that leg.
If it does not stick to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. Force all its dislocating aspects such that the immobilization commands him to sit down with his legs extended if he can do so. Sit behind him to hold him in place and slightly back him toward the back for a little bit. Then sit yourself on his thighs.
Your back should stick to his face and place his leg between your legs. Then immobilize his knee with your hands, holding them together on his knee with the tips of your fingers. Press his side towards you with all your strength while another helper extends their leg until the knee returns to its place.
The sign of it returning is that the leg sticks to the thigh in a soft, non-resisting manner. Then compress her and stick the leg to the thigh, then tie them both with a bandage for three or four days. Then release them. It should only be used for slight walking until they strengthen sufficiently.
If returning to it as described by us proves impossible, otherwise use strong ligatures according to the description I provided for treating the hip until it returns.
The thirty-third chapter.
In the treatment of removing the heel spur.
The heel can be removed gradually or completely. Removal of the heel can either be inside or outside, and you will see that when it breaks off, the heel will protrude outwardly to the side to which it broke off.
As for the treatment of its removal, it is easier to reverse it. You should gently push with your hands and straighten it until it returns to its original position. As for treating when it breaks completely, you should have the patient sit down and be held firmly by a strong servant behind him in the middle of his back.
Then, you hold the foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below at the level of the ankle. Then, pull the foot towards yourself with your right hand and then with your left twice. After that, extend it with your left hand and push the foot's chest towards the leg without violence.
You perform this twice as we described. Then, in the third time, push the foot's chest towards the leg while pulling at the ankle. If it returns in one or two tries in this manner and you see that the foot is level, otherwise redo the operation on it because it will return.
If it doesn't return to you as we described and otherwise, place the patient on his back on the ground, dig deeply into the earth with a very strong stake so that it falls between his thighs. I have wrapped him tightly except for that he might not harm the patient, then fixes his knee joint.
Then another servant holds the man's hands either with his own or ties a rope around his neck. Then each servant extends his arms against his companion, with the bend of the elbow touching him so he does not sag downwards during extension, and then the doctor adjusts the jaw by his hands.
And another servant holds the correct leg downwards, then the jaw returns quickly. If the jaw has returned and you can see that it does so properly, carry the bandage and the strain, securing them tightly with straps. Place the ankle under the strap to lower it, and it would be advisable to avoid the nerve located above the heel from behind.
So that the bandage is not too tight and hurts him, leave it for two or three days. If the bandage relaxes, tighten it again then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If he walks before this period, it might happen that his jaw fractures and gets damaged or he won't accept the treatment afterwards. If he has a hot tumor, you should use what we described previously for calming inflammation in other parts of treatment and applying pressure until it subsides.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In treating dislocated fingers of the hand.
It is necessary to gently and without force, adjust what has dislocated by extending the foot for a short time. This is not difficult but rather easy. If the dislocation occurred in some parts of the heel bone, it would be advisable to place the leg on a flat surface on the ground.
Or on a plank while standing as if walking, then you raise your foot onto the joint where it dislocated, and press it with your foot firmly until it returns to its place without showing any deformity in that location.
Then make a plate under his foot, so that the whole foot has two heads. Then tighten it firmly for three days. After that, let him rest and avoid walking for many days until it strengthens and he can return if God willing.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the types of fracture that occurs with a wound, or with a break, or both.
When something like this happens and its treatment involves embolization, it often leads to death.
Therefore, it should not be treated with embolization except by one who is cautious in his technique, long-sighted, tender and thoughtful, not careless or bold. Initially, only medications that alleviate hot tumors should be used, and patience must be exercised.
To the extent that Allah has provided safety from harm in mild disease, where a little hope for recovery appears, remove it with your power at first opportunity before the hot tumor manifests.
If the member returns as desired, use the treatment that cools hot tumors and treat the wound with suitable dry ointments. If there is a fracture involved in the fracture and it happened that there are clean fragments, remove them. And conform to what we have mentioned about simple diseases in their respective locations.
And exert yourself and purify your spirit from entering the path of deceit as you have instructed me, for this will secure your way and protect you, may God protect you.
