 CHAPTER FORTY.
On cauterization of a dislocated hip.
 Sometimes harmful humidities reach the hip joint and result in its coming out of its place.
The symptom of this is that one leg is longer than the other when one is measured against the other; and a hollow is found there [i.e.
at the hip].
Then you should cauterize the patient over the hip joint itself with a circular burn, after you have marked with ink a circle round the femoral joint, so that the joint falls in the middle of the circle.
The cautery should be the one whose description has already been given in cauterization of the stomach.
But if you have not this cautery by you, give him three cauterizations with the larger size olivary cautery.
The burn should be to the depth of the whole thickness of the skin.
Then dress till healed.
