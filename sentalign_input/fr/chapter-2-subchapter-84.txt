Of wounds
We have already mentioned in the division the treatment of wounds; now we will tell you the treatments by hand and by medicine, according to the fulfillment.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and by what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by throwing stones, and cutting with a sword and a knife, or a lance or wood or an arrow, or similar things;
or they are made according to the places of the body, like wounds that fall on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the treatment of each wound, and will start with the simple head wounds, for the reminder will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, be careful if it is from a stone throw or similar things, and the skin is still torn and the wound is large,
and you fear the development of a hot abscess: then immediately make it bleed from the cephalic vein especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side of the injured part;
and avoid the patient's overconsumption of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be reduced, and he should not drink any wine, nor eat any meat;
and put on the wound, if a hot abscess develops, cotton soaked only in rose oil, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, put on the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and it is not altered by the air, a powder, which I will describe a little later;
and if the burn has altered it, apply some ointments, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large as from a sword cut and similar, and the lips cannot be brought together by probes, then join them by stitching, as I will describe for the wounds of the abdomen, in the suturing.
If the wound is exposed to the bone, and hangs, and holds only a little, then cut it; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of the skin,
and instruct the patient to eat heavy foods, like heads and cooked wheat, as well as pulses, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, then cut out all the rot, and discard it, then treat it;
and if there is an artery in the wound or a vein, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, then seek the artery, and if you find it dislodged, then tie it with a thread;
and if that does not help, then cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and it is to put in this powder that seals before the burn has altered it.
And the composition of the powder is: take one part incense; two parts dragon's blood; three parts quicklime, and grind it finely,
and fill the wound, and press it firmly, until it is well ventilated and joined with its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it without untying, if it does not swell; because the medicine is not removed until it is healed.
And sometimes this is done with just quicklime, when incense or dragon's blood is not available, but the burn has not altered the wound.
And if the burn has altered the wound, especially in summer, then do not use this powder;
but apply some digestive ointments, or barley flour poultices made with water and honey, until it expels pus;
then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if the fracture of the bone comes with the wound, and it is small, extract it with fine pincers;
and I will tell you later about the fractures of the head.
Of the wound of the neck
If a wound comes to the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy but to leave it untreated, and not to apply anything constricting, because it harms the nerves and makes them retract;
and do not apply anything cold on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but the medicine should be gentle, like lime washed in sweet water, and mixed with rose oil, and cucia washed also in sweet water,
and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is hollow and full of pus, pierce it in a lower place;
and if the artery is cut, and blood flows from it, open it, tie it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the gullet, and the passage through which food goes is preserved,
then sew the gullet over the pipe of the throat, and do not touch the throat but put it back according to its natural shape;
and then bind it appropriately, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, look for it;
and if there are pieces of bone, pull them all out if you can, and those you cannot get, leave them until the wound rots,
and it is separated and the exit is relieved;
and if the wound is fresh, sprinkle on the powder I mentioned.
And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have described in its chapter.
Of the wound from a lance or knife
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, see if air escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with its blood, do not put the powder on it in the first hour, nor bind it for the blood to not stay deep,
and return to the heart, and kill the patient;
but apply an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, put old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture,
and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more;
so there will be no spasm, nor trembling of the heart nor difficulty in breathing;
and when you see good signs, know that the wound is safe.
Then treat it with probes and other remedies, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and it works, know then that there is a fistula; treat it as it should be.
And if the wound is from an incision of a sword or knife, and it is simple, or on the chest or back, treat it as described above;
if it is large, with stitching; and if it is small, with powder, and if it is pressed into the bone, and there are broken pieces, seek the wound, and pull them out if they are separated;
and if they are not separated, let the wound rot, so the extraction will be easier;
and for other wounds on other members, the judgment is as we have said.
