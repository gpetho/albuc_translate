On the method of cauterizing for tremor.
Chapter 56.
When someone experiences tremor due to cold affecting the nerves, quartan fever, or another cause, then apply four or five cauteries along the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra, one on the chest, and one on the stomach.
Tremor is calmed by olive oil cauterization, and recovery from the cold illness is hastened.
