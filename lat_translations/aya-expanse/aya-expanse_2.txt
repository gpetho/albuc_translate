Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	Now that I have completed this book for you, which is the latest work on medicine with additions thereto, and reached the end of it through his explanations and statements, it has seemed to me fitting to complete it for you with this tractate, which forms part of the operations, namely, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery with the hand is neglected in our region and entirely private at present, until perhaps the knowledge of it has perished and its trace has vanished; and there remain from it only a few descriptions in ancient books, which have been altered by hand, and it happens to them error and hesitation until the intentions are closed up and its sight extended: I have thought fit to revive it with the order of this tractate according to the way of explanation, declaration, and abbreviation; and that I should come to the forms of cautery instruments and the rest of the tools of work; with the addition of declarations and the elaboration of what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	Moreover, since a good master of this art with his own hand is not to be found in our time for the reasons mentioned above, it being that the science of medicine is long, and he who intends to practice it needs first to be trained in the knowledge of anatomy as described by Galen, until he knows the limbs' joints, forms, and their connection and separation, and has a knowledge of bones, nerves, tendons, the number of them, their exit, the pulsating and quiet places, and the exits of their vessels.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of this, Hippocrates said that "name is much with name, but little with work, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	Indeed, we have already spoken of him at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is not aware of what we have said about anatomy, will not succeed but will fall into error, which hurts people; as I have seen many among them, who boast themselves to be learned in this science, yet without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	This is because I have seen a stupid physician cut into a scrofulous swelling on a woman's neck and he injured some arteries in her neck; therefore the woman's blood flowed until she died in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I have seen another physician who attempted to extract a stone from a man, who had been suffering for many years, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he went to him and extracted the stone with a chisel.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Why the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And indeed I had been called to extract it as well; and I saw from the magnitude of the stone and the weakness of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who received payment from a certain duke of our land for medicine; and there was a black eunuch with him whose leg was fractured near the ankle joint. The doctor acted in ignorance and tightened the fracture over the wound with bandages, and with strong binding pins, and did not allow the wound to heal.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	He then released him according to his wishes.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	He then released him after a few days and ordered him not to loosen the binding; and he remained in that state until his leg and foot healed, and it ended in disaster.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called to him, and I acted to loosen the binding; and peace was achieved, and he was delivered from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the damage was already confirmed in the member; and I could not stop it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So the corruption ceased its progress in the member until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who cut into the cancerous sore; and it festered for days until the evil of his disease was magnified with the lord of the patient.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	This is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it should not be approached with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can endure it, so that it may be cut off entirely.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of that Son, it is necessary for you to know that surgery is divided into two parts with the hand: namely, the operation that is associated with safety; and the operation through which there is danger in many positions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have now examined in every place of this book where comes the operation that is filled with fear and trembling.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to be cautious of that, and examine yourself: so that the ignorant do not find a way to speak and dishonor.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore take measure with caution and protection, and attend to your sick with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading to grace of God for salvation and a commendable succession: and dismiss terrible afflictions that are difficult to heal; and free your minds from what makes you afraid, so that hesitation may enter into your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	Indeed, it remains more for your glory, and more sublime in this world, and ultimately for your numbers.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen indeed said in some of his precepts.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness; do not call a bad doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have divided this work into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	**First Chapter**
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On treatment with fire, and on acute medication, chapters, and arranged from head to foot, and forms of instruments and surgical tools: and everything necessary for surgery.
Capitulum secundum.	**Second Chapter**
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On incision and perforation, phlebotomy and venesection, and wounds: and extraction of arrows and similar objects: and the entire chapter, arranged in the form of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	**Third Chapter**
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, dislocation, and cure of twists, and similar conditions: chapter arranged from head to foot, and forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.

Pars I.	**Part I**
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	¶ On healing and damage from cauterization: and what types of preparations are appropriate for it, and at what time; and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	**Chapter I**
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before we proceed with the description of operations, it is necessary to speak of the quality of healing and damage (from cauterization), and in what type of preparation it should be exhibited.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore that the discussion of the quality of cauterization and its damage is a lengthy and subtle matter, a secret known only to those with knowledge.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Many learned men have also spoken about this and disagreed; however, I find their brief remarks sufficient, fearing that a longer discussion would lead to an unnecessary extension.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore that cauterization generally applies to every type of preparation that includes matter or is without matter; except for two types of preparations, which are the hot preparation without matter and the dry preparation without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, there is disagreement regarding the hot and dry preparation with matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that cauterization is beneficial for these.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the contrary to him, namely that cautery is not suitable for a sickness that arises from heat and dryness, since the nature of fire is heat, and it is inappropriate to heal with heat and dryness when one is afflicted by hot and dry ailments.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the contrary to him replied: "Cautery provides a cure for every hot and dry sickness that befalls human bodies, since when you compare a human body and its humors to the fire's complexion, you find the human body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I say, based on his argument: because from my own experience, I have already extracted that several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, one should not approach it unless they are already experienced and have practiced the last chapter on cautery, and understood the variety of human complexions, and the disposition of their ailments within themselves, and the causes of those ailments, and the events that befall them, and the time frame for those.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the other complexions, there is no need for fear, especially in cold and wet ailments.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	Indeed, all doctors have now agreed on these points, and they do not disagree about using cautery for them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, my sons, that through the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and the goodness of cautery with medicine, fire is simple, whose action does not reach any other member except the one to be cauterized, and it does not harm another member joined to it, unless by a slight injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of surgery indeed reaches that which is elongated from the body part, and perhaps causes a difficult healing condition in the member or perhaps it kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, due to its subtlety and the quality of its substance, does not cause it unless it exceeds [the necessary amount].
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Indeed, it is through experience that we have realized this, due to the length of service and study with the art, and the focus on the truth of things; and for that reason, I am excusing the length of this speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if not, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I will reveal to you a hidden secret about fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies it expels, through which it expels ailments with philosophical discourse, sharpened by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, children, that they disagree in the time when it is necessary to perform cauterization, and they set a better time for the true [healing].
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is necessary at all times; for the damage that has occurred due to time is submerged in the healing that is attracted with cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if cauterization is due to pains from necessary pains that are strong and urgent, which do not tolerate delay; for it is feared from them that a greater evil may occur, than the minor damage that does not pass due to time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let not that fall in your minds, O sons, which they do not estimate, unless it be the common and foolish doctors, namely that the disease which is healed by cauterization does not always return: and they assign its consequence, and the matter is not as they think; because cauterization is not, unless in medicine which alters the complexion, and dries up the humors which are causes, wherefore pains happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Yet cauterization surpasses medicine in the swiftness of its healing power, and the strength of its operation, and the authority it wields: and it is possible that the disease returns at some point in time according to the complexion of the patient, and the location of the illness, and the strength of the latter: and what is prepared in the body from the accumulation of excesses therein: and what comes to itself through the acquisition of its causes from food, and similar things, unless a disease occurs in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle disease in a member from the accumulation of few excesses and humors, such as cauterization on a tooth because of pain, or similar things; for it is possible that that pain does not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens rarely.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the common belief that cauterization is the last resort of medicine is incorrect; it does not refer to what they intend, for they believe there is no cure that can be achieved with medicine or any other means after the occasion for cauterization has passed.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the contrary is true; and the intent (of cautery) is that it is the last resort of medicine, not unless when we apply methods of treatment to certain illnesses, and they do not bring relief: then we apply cautery at the end, and it brings relief; then from that point on, it no longer holds true that cautery is the last resort of medicine, according to the understanding of the common people and many physicians.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	However, the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; they did not say this unless because of the equality of gold and the subtlety of its material; and they said that it does not cause pus to form at the site of cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	That is not entirely true; for I have already proven it and found that it does not always do so in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cautery with gold itself is good and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you perform cautery with fire using gold in a fire, it is not declared to you when the fire burns according to the quantity that you want, because of the redness of gold; and when it flies towards the cold itself and if you add more heat on top of it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	That is why the artisan falls away from that work; and because of that, cautery with iron has become more convenient and closer to us, from correctness towards practice.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And indeed I have now ordered this Chapter on Wound Care, according to the sections: and I have ordered them from head to foot, so that the seeker may find what he wants from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	**On the method of cauterization for the forehead in the coronal suture.**
Caput II.	**Head II.**
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	**Herein is described the cauterization which governs the balance of humidity and cold over the brain: these two are causes of sorrow, due to the abundance of flux of humours from the head towards the eyes and ears, and due to excessive sleep, toothache, and sore throat; and generally all diseases arising from cold, such as paralysis, and those from excessive heat, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ailments.**
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	**The method of cauterization is as follows: first, you must persuade the patient: so that he may be purified by three or four washings with a suitable medicine for the head, according to the needs of the patient's condition and age, and his usual custom.**
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	**Then instruct him to make incisions on his head with a scalpel.**
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	**Then have him sit between your hands in a cross-legged position, so that he has placed his hands on his chest.**
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of your nose between your eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever therefore your middle finger touches, mark that place with an unhealed wound.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then use the cautery flame with oil: this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place the same over the marked place with an unhealed wound, downward, as your hand is gradually tightened, and you turn it around.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly release your hand, and examine the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that it has detached from the bone as much as a head or a hand, then release your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the same iron or another one if it gets cold: until you see the bones, which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then add some salt, dissolve it in water, soak the cloth in it, and place it over the place, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place over it the cloth soaked in butter and leave it over the place until the scar from fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with a four-ingredient ointment until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the deeper and more open the wound remains, the more pus it emits; therefore, it is better and more curative.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the jaw; and hold the cautery until something of bone thickness is softened.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is recommended after what is softened from the bone; then it is treated.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to approach the cautery to the last, until it makes a deep impression in the jaw, so that the bone falls out, which is done like a horn; or an instrument that women use to enlarge the opening of their letters: and they estimate that vapors from this place leave the head, and the open wound heals over time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated until it is consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But I do not see these two types of cautery at all for some people except according to the way they fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to let it go, for me, is better with the health of that very person.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity, as we have witnessed in other parts of the body, and especially when the head is naturally weak and infirm, the first species of cautery is more salutary and better for me, and that I use in operation; therefore, when using it, let it be for the sake of health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head, it should be done with regard to the pain throughout the head.
Caput III.	Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the head and persists, becoming severe and using herbs, poultices, hot applications, oils, and other remedies fails to alleviate it.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one of the cauteries we have mentioned and does not benefit from them, then consider this.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the weak head is of strong constitution by nature and is not infirm, and it feels no terrifying cold, then cauterize below with another cautery that is milder.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize the entire head with its own cautery, without penetrating the skin, and expose the amount from the bone as we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize the same head with one cautery at the back of the head, in a place called the vas, which is where the blood flows, and raise your mother's strength in this, and you will not expose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	The patient indeed finds himself because of that persistent pain, and various from the pain of all other parts of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say this for the cautery in its place: and it should be cautery, by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head more gently with cautery, by which is cauterized the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	§ Regarding the cauterization of hemicranias, both with hot medicine as well as with iron.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When a painful and persistent sensation occurs in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and is relieved by medicines that cleanse the head, and the remaining treatment is given as I described in the divisions of ailments, without affecting the whole, then cauterization should be performed on it according to two methods: either with hot medicine burning it; or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cautery with hot medicine burning it is to take a single tooth from another, and remove its own skin, and cut off its extremities from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then, cut the place of pain with a phlebotomist's side, until it becomes a place under the skin where the tooth is caught.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore, introduce him into the same under the skin until it is hidden. Then tighten over it with a small constrictive tie and leave it for fifteen hours. Afterward, dissolve it and extract another one, and leave the scar for two or three days. Afterwards, place a poultice soaked in butter on top of it until the wound produces pus. Finally, treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to do it with some burning medicines, as I have written in the twelfth chapter of the treatise on "Medicine for Wounds", then do so.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization of it with iron is indeed done in this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The Fire Cautery, whose form is this one.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called the Claw (Clavilis), because its form resembles a claw, in which there is something of inflammation, and in the middle of it is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it over the spot and hold your hand, and slowly turn the iron with velocity. And the amount that is cauterized should be according to the thickness of the skin, like its midpoint.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And then withdraw your hand so as not to burn the artery below, and avoid a flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then he should soak the cloth in salt water and place it on the wound, leaving it for three days. Then he should remove the cloth with butter, and afterwards treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if it is necessary, cauterize this headache with the tip of a knife according to the rule of cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And be careful from the incision of the artery in this headache, not too deep.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	§ On the method of cauterization in old headaches.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When treating a headache, as we have said in the previous treatment and in dividing diseases, if the treatment does not help, and you see that the disease is not sufficient for what we said about the first cauterization with medicine or with fire, then it is necessary to use the cautery knife until it becomes white after making signs on the place of pain with a line, whose length is the middle finger, or something like that. And place your hand once and tighten it until you cut the artery and reach the jaw.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, you must be careful not to cauterize the continuity of the jawbone, which moves during chewing, or the side, or the nerve that moves it, otherwise a spasm may occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And it should be over the guard and caution of the flow of blood from the artery, which has been cut off.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	Indeed, in cutting it, there is fear, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is neither studious nor expert, and thus he relinquishes the operation to someone else at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with the remembrance of the management of the flow of blood from the artery according to its manner and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Which if you see from the disease, that it does not suffice this cautery, and you see the body enduring the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, take care of the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see, administer the cautery that we said in the chapter on extracting the artery with a cautery holder having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	Indeed, cautery is better with these tools and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	§ Regarding the cauterizing of the pain in gold.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When there is pain in the gold from cold, and it is cured with solutions, and the remaining cure as we said in division, and the pain does not go away, then apply the fire cautery: and that is what is called the Point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then, after igniting the point, it should be placed around the entire ear, as it was shown; or around both ears if pain is felt in either or both at the same time.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	Then, using the cautery, stretch it from the root of the ear, after marking the spots with wax, and let the cautery be ten points in length on every ear, approximately as much.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the wounds until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	# On Cauterization in Surgery
Caput VII.	Chapter VII
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The surgery that is cured by cauterization is not other than a certain kind of condition arising from phlegm, as we mentioned in the classification of ailments.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And for the species of cauterization due to desiccation and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with burning, and applying salves, and gargarisms, and your treatment does not bring relief, then it is necessary to cauterize the affected part three times with hot instruments: one at the root of the ear, a second just below its natural position, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery from the opposite part of the infirmity.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not occur unless it is in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the shape of cauterization is such that it cauterizes the same cautery in a straight line at the extreme end of the upper ear under the forehead, and at another time; its length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until the amount of burning reaches half the thickness of the skin.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of cautery, and it is a kind from a knife, whose shape has been mentioned: however, it should not be too thin as you see, and there should be a little excess thickness on the knife.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with what has been mentioned until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	# Regarding the method of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes ancient and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries over every horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of his head, as mentioned, and another cautery at the back of his head, according to what has been said, and the method of cauterization should be according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	It is also cauterized with a cauterizing iron over the stomach's opening: and this is the final method.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then it is treated with what preceded it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	§ On the method of cauterization in oblivion.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that in the first instance, great wounds of the bowels receive a quantity sufficient to cleanse the brain, and also small pills which purify the mind.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then clean the whole head and place over its forehead a plaster of glue described in the treatise on plasters; apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	The very same is the method of cauterization: and perform it according to the same order that I mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore it is cured by that, then it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then perform three cauterizations on the posterior part of his head, which extend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and place between each cauterization the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then comes the care of cauterization, together with what preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	However, if you wish to add it, and the patient can tolerate it: then perform cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish to add it: then cauterize the same over the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then comes the care of the wound, until it is healed: and cauterization should be repeated according to the form that has been described.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	§ Regarding the method of cauterization in paralysis, and its softening.
Caput X.	Head X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you proceed with the purification of the head with herbs, and as we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then care for the head of the patient: afterwards, cauterize the wound with hot iron in the middle of the head, and with hot iron over every horn of the head, and with hot iron over its posterior part, and three times over the spinal bones of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	However, if you need to soften the body from other diseases, and the patient can tolerate it, and the disease is strong: then cauterize with four hot irons over the spinal bones of the back, and with the last cautery, until much of its skin is burned, and then remove your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for the wound until it heals, and thus apply oil to the cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	**On the method of cauterization for epilepsy.**
Caput XI.	**Chapter XI.**
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic should not be cauterized except for that whose epilepsy arises from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore it is necessary for the surgeons to first explore his brain with their instruments, and with the rest of the care that we have mentioned in division; when the patient's condition is severe, or he is tolerant of medication.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if it is a boy who does not tolerate medication, then gargles and brain-cleansing chewing should be administered for many days beforehand with the aid of food that has been prepared in a good way.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then wash his head, afterwards cauterize it with a single cautery in the middle of the head, according to what has been mentioned before regarding the method; and another cautery on its back, and over every horn of his head with cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If however the patient is strong and tolerant, then he should be cauterized with the cauteries that I have mentioned regarding paralysis, and the softening of the body over the spines of the neck and back; and let the cautery be oiled according to the method that has been mentioned before.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	If, however, the patient is a young boy, then apply a fine cautery in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	**On the manner of cauterization in melancholia.**
Caput XII.	**Head XII.**
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize them with cautery, as we said regarding paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of melancholic humors and the body is weakened by moisture, then give it something that purifies its brain, as we said before in separation; then shave the head of the afflicted person, and make afterwards a properly shaped turban of linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head, and the afflicted person should sit square on all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Now apply the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is better from an ancient butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over a tempered fire to the extent that the finger can tolerate when it is introduced into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then he should moisten it thoroughly in the center of his head with a circular motion, and leave it until it hardens.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	He should do that with the weak patient every week once, following the rest of his regimen well, until he is healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if not, he should cauterize it by making many small punctures on it, besides holding a hot iron, deep down where it smells bad.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	This kind of cauterization moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then he should place a cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat, on top of it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	§ In the manner of cauterization with descending water towards the eye.
Caput XIII.	Head XIII.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I mentioned in division, then begin and wash the weak patient, with that which will cleanse his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep it from all moistures, and make it sit in a bath, during several days of fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command her to shave her head and burn it in the middle of her skull.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Next, burn it with two hot iron tools if there is simultaneous capture of the water descent in both eyes; or from one side if the water is captured in only one eye; and cut away with the cautery all veins and arteries that are under the skin, and let the burns be long in width on the temporals, and dry up the blood flow.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything from it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible, and I come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, cutting them off, and guarding against the flow of blood.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And when it is burned into the flesh, under two bones, with the last two hot iron tools.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	**On the method of burning in ancient tears.**

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old, continuous, and when they affect the veins and arteries that are clearly visible on the outside of the head, this is due to excessive cold phlegm; then burn with the same iron tool that I described at the beginning of water descent, with a burn in the middle of the head, and with two hot iron tools over each temporal, and with two hot iron tools under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you need to add to it, then cauterize it carefully on every side with a small cautery, above the end of the eyebrow.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	**On the method of cauterization for a nosebleed.**

Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it with what we mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help: then make the patient drink a remedy containing three parts of weak wine for three nights; afterward, shave his head and cauterize the wound with a middle-sized cautery, using olive oil as the cautery.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize the wound with two-pronged cautery above the two eyebrows, just beneath the hairline.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And be careful not to injure the artery.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the form of the two-pronged cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	**On the method of cauterization for soothing the eyelid.**
Caput XVI.	**Chapter 16.**
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid becomes softened due to inflammation or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery, using this cautery in the shape of a crescent moon.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows with a few burns on every part; and they will be elongated from the two timbers, and let the length of every burn be according to the length of the eyebrow, and do not use your last hand with the burn, but rather according to the amount that is dried up by the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of the burn according to this method of lunar burn.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	§ On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are pointing inward towards the eye.
Caput XVII.	Head XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The burn on this is according to two methods: either with fire, or with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	But in the burn with fire, first of all, the patient should be made to let go of his hairs, if there are any that are removing them, until they lengthen and equalize.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, they are burning him near his origin: then close his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move until they have healed.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they have healed and equalized, then put the head of the patient in your lap: then mark over the eyelids of his eyes with wax, as a sign that it is according to the shape of the myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a cloth soaked in albumen or in the mucus of psylli over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then use a fire-brand whose shape is like this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape that you have marked gradually on many wounds until the surface of the skin is burned, which appears like the form of a myrtle leaf entirely.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of health of your work is that if you notice the eyelid already contracting and hairs growing at the site of the eye's puncture.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So free your hand then and leave it alone for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place a cloth with butter on it over it until the scar is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any of the hairs return after an hour and the eyelid softens: then repeat the cauterization over that place as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	But if the hairs are below: then cauterize it until it is driven to its natural place and it regrows so that the hairs do not pierce the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the method of cauterization when a medicinal fire is used in the same case.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is necessary to urge the patient to pull out the hairs until they are completely extended and equalized.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take soap known to be free from lime, and a weight of one ounce or something like that, then apply it with gentle friction, and do so quickly so as not to become cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread it out from that [mixture] onto the cloth you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over one or both eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a cloth dipped in egg white, and let the patient's head rest in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine, and gently press it.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you move it whenever the patient feels a stinging from the medicine, for its sting is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While he persists in this thing that he has discovered, then abandon the medicine and move it away with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the bite has ceased, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider that if you see the eyelids rising as they do when contracted with heat or a cut, it is good; but if not, then repeat the application of medicine over that place where the medicine has not taken hold or faded until your operation is complete and the eye is contracted.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place a poultice of butter over it until the burning of the skin is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with a diaphanous ointment or any other until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during the operation to guard the final guard so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If after a few days the eyelid becomes soft and something from the hair fights into the eye, then repeat the medicine over that place which is softening from the eyelid as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of humans differ in size and shape.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to that, your consideration should be such that the path of righteousness is not hidden from him who studies this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	§ On the method of cauterization for the tear duct fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, because of what we have said concerning the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then you should cauterize it in this manner.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Advise the patient to place his head in your lap and hold his head with both hands, so that it does not move or be agitated when he holds his own head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place the soaked cloth on his forehead or in the thin mucilage over his eye: then apply the cauterizing iron, which has this shape.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	It should be concave, just like the shape of a quill from one end to the other when it is cauterizing: and if it is penetrating all the way to the other end or if it is trying upwards, then it is incorrect.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this cut is better suited for your purpose.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and drain the blood from it, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it and drain the pus from it.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place a hot iron on it, which is made to ignite very much.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold it with your hand for a little while near the iron by the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand does not slip or disturb the patient; and place the hot iron on the eyelid and burn it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you reach the end of your hot iron up to the mouth, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the hot iron once or twice, as you need; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then apply a cloth with butter, and take care of it with a drying ointment until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If after forty days it does not heal: then apply a sharp corrosive medicine to it until the bone is exposed; and shave it according to what has come to its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterization of the fistula, which some have called the first.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Intent on the location of the fistula, find it and then insert a fine needle (a 'cannula') into the fissure itself, which is shaped like this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And insert into it a quantity of melted lead (a drachma), holding your hand firm with good grip on the needle, so that the patient does not move at all to prevent the liquid lead from entering his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place over the patient's eye a cloth soaked in either albumen or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	Lead will burn the site of the fistula and heal it with a wonderful cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	Which, if the fistula is healed through cauterization and treatment as we have said, is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if that does not happen, then it is necessary to administer a nasal hole and bring the fistula back to run with the nose, according to where it will reach its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	# On the method of cauterization in lip cracks.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Many times accidents occur in the split of the lip, which are called pilings, and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you treat these fissures, as we have said regarding the division of the illness, and if treatment does not help, then use a small cautery knife in this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And the depth of it should be according to the thinness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then apply the hot iron quickly to those fissures until it reaches the cautery into the depths of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with bandages until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	## On Cauterizing Oral Fissures
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs in the root of the gum, or on the palate, or among the roots of teeth; then it forms pus and bursts; afterward it becomes infected, and pus flows, and a fissure is formed; then, if treatment does not help it, one must use hot irons according to the size that enters into the fissure.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the burning steel into the fistula's opening and hold your hand until the burning iron reaches its depth and its tip: do this once or with two strokes.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then take care of it afterward, as we said about the treatment until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the gangrened part is cut off and healed, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if that does not help, then it is necessary to remove the place and take away the corrupted bone as it comes to its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	§ Regarding the cauterization of the gingiva and the softening of the teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gingiva softens due to moisture and the teeth become loose, and all care with medicines does not help, then put the sick head in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then apply the hot cautery, whose shape will come after these actions, so that you place a tube over the tooth and insert the burning cautery quickly into it, and hold your hand for a moment until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching to the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And then lift up your hand: afterwards repeat the cautery several times, as you see fit.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then the patient should fill their mouth with water and salt, and hold it for one hour, and then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth, motion is fixed, the gums, having become softened, tighten, and thus the corrupted moisture dries up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	§ On the method of cauterization for teeth pain.
Caput XXIII.	Head XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the toothache is due to coldness, or there is a chill, or a fracture, and treatment with medicines does not help, then cautery should be applied in two ways: either with butter, or with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cautery with butter is to take the melted butter, and boil it in a brass vessel or in tubes.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cloth, and wrap the affected part tightly.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse the affected part in boiling butter: and place it eagerly over the aching tooth, and hold it until it becomes numb: then repeat several times until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, immerse the cloth or bandage in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; then place a hot iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the depths of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	Its cauterization with fire, however, is to be aimed at the air tube or the iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And it should be placed in the body in such a way that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the lower jaw.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply the cauterizing fire, whose form will come together, and place it on that tooth; hold your hand until the cautery freezes.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do that several times, as the pain will be moved, or on the same day, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary for the impression of that cautery to fill the sick mouth with good butter, and hold it for a certain time, then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whatever extreme means possible; this is the form of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	On the method of cauterization in straphulae.
Caput XXIIII.	**Chapter XXIV**
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When straphulae (staph infections) are caused by phlegm, cold humidities, and do not yield to treatment with medicines or quick digestion, then apply a cauterizing iron of this form.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	It should have two open ends so that smoke can escape from one end while the other is lit; place it on the affected area once, and then a second time if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the abscess is small, then apply the cauterizing iron according to its size.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and apply a cloth soaked in butter on top; do this until the burned tissue is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then care for it with a dental ointment until the shape of the canal is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	On the method of cauterization for hoarseness and constriction of the throat.
Caput XXV.	**Chapter XXV**
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When moistures are trapped above the lung channel, and especially when it is accompanied by a cold complexion, then it is necessary that the patient be made to evacuate with the first use of dissolvable medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then, he cauterizes the affected area just below the root of the throat in a depressed place, and be careful not to come into contact with the cautery either with your throat or your skin, unless it is absolutely necessary.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then, he cauterizes the affected area with another cautery at the joint of the neck, ending at its last spine, and the cautery should be made in a lock according to the manner that preceded it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then, he continues to care for it with what preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	§ On the method of cauterization in lung diseases and coughing.
Caput XXVI.	Head 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When coughing and lung disease are caused by cold moistures, and the patient does not have fever or phthisis, nor is it an old illness, then he should cauterize the affected area with two cauteries above the furcula in depressed places, with forceps and hooks.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts, and the cautery should be a tube according to the form that preceded it.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if your cauterization by puncturing with a cautery, called the Punctum, precedes in puncturing the pain of the ear: and the punctures are from thirty punctures up to almost others.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself with what preceded it, until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now it has three branches according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Why should the cauterization be done with it when you make one stroke with three cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	§ Regarding the method of cauterization in Titillico, in the dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the helper is dislocated due to moisture and does not form itself back to its place within the allotted time until it becomes accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a slight movement that occurs as we have just witnessed it, at that time it is necessary that you reduce the dislocation in the first instance.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient should lie down on his back or side of the healthy body.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then raise the skin, which is inside the Titillico towards the upper parts with your left hand's fingers: and if the joint dislocates to the inner side.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Next, having a cautery instrument with two tubes of fire.
Cuius forma est haec.	What is the form of this?
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Next, he cauterizes the wound until it penetrates to another side and reaches a four-sided shape of cauterization.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And when the cauterization is done with an instrument having three tubes of fire, then the shape of cauterization becomes six-sided, and the tubes are according to the thickness they have been drawn through.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of the instrument having three tubes of fire.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And when one is added beyond this manner, then the number of cauteries becomes eight.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Next, place crushed salt over the cautery.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Next, apply the bandage to hold the patient still so that the member does not move until it is healed.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is to the upper parts and it rarely occurs, then cauterize the same part of the bone with a hot iron, or make many small punctures with cauteries.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	When the union is strengthened, and moisture is removed, the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	**On the method of cauterization of the stomach.**
Caput XXVIII.	**Head XXVIII.**
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and great moisture occur in the stomach, until they extract it from its condition, and increase discharge to it, and persistent treatment is not effective; then the patient should turn over on his back, and stretch out his legs, and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the chest in the shape of a shell with a finger's worth of cautery, and two cauteries below the two sides of the single cautery, until it comes to a triangular shape of the cauteries.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And stretch between them so that they do not stick together when they form pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cautery should be the thickness of two-thirds of the skin's depth.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition; and if you wish to cauterize a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery that is made for doing this cautery be one cautery according to the circular shape according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it which is troubled by this cautery: and it is like marks on the stomach a point according to the quantity, as if with wax when encaustic is used; then cauterize it itself with the cautery of the point; then treat it itself with the cure that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	Regarding the manner of cauterization, use a cold iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When, in the liver, pain occurs from cold and moisture, or from excessive swelling, until it expels its excess by a natural process, and the sick person is cured as we have said, but it does not profit him, then he must lie on his back over his head, and make signs with encaustic three cauterizations according to this figure, and the same quantity below the hypogastric region from where the cubit of man extends; and let there be space between every cautery according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body straight: and do not press your hand much with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And the quantity of it that is to be cauterized should be according to the thickness of the skin, half as much not to add; and let the sick person stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already stretched his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed it is possible for you to use this cautery with a surgical knife when you possess subtlety and caution in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And be careful not to proceed too far in cauterization, so that the thickness of the skin does not become extreme, affecting the whole body and reaching the intestines; for the skin there is delicate, so know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	# On the method of cauterization for the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens that there is a detachment, and you need to know if this apostema is within the flesh of the liver or its tunica: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, a severe pain appears, without sharpness; and if it is in the tunica of the liver, the pain has a sharp quality. And now you see that it exhausted his doctors' treatment.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, the patient must lie down on his back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then, the shape of the location of the apostema with wax; then, light the cautery that is similar to a radiograph.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is the form of it.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And it should be cauterized with one cautery until the whole skin is burned and it reaches the sinuses, until all the pus is discharged; then the care should turn to the cure of the wounds until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And this method of cauterization should not be used unless one has studied medicine and dealt with these diseases many times; then, and only then, should they dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	To leave it alone is better for me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	## On Cauterization for Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that cauterization with the roots of aristolochia was used for cold pleurisy according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, as you receive the roots of dried aristolochia, to take one root longer, which is found from that, and it should be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then dip it in oil; then light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then he cauterizes it with one cautery in the area between the fork's continuation and the neck, and with two small cauteries beneath the guides at a slight slope towards the part that is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries as well in the area between the fifth and sixth ribs towards the back a little, and another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from the back: one in the area between the two blades, and two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to press your hand with the cautery, indeed, it should be applied openly onto the skin, smelling of burning.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And certain ancient people have said that there are men who use a cautery made of a similar iron rod: they ignite it and insert it into the area between the ribs until it reaches the specific point, and then it is withdrawn, and the pus comes out, as we have said regarding the epigastrium.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this procedure with the cautery, there is a fear that either the patient dies immediately, or an abscess forms at the site, which does not heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	**On the Method of Cauterization: The Splen (Spleen) Head 32.**
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat a spleen illness, because of what we said regarding dividing the illness from treatment, and your treatment does not help, then cauterize it in those three ways, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	The first way is to make three or four cuts along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the smaller livers, of which the shape precedes.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And for all cauterizations, the thickness should be that of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And the manner of cauterization, as we said regarding the cauterization of the liver, should be equal.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the cauterization; let the patient be lying on their back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another way of cauterization is as follows: having a fire with two flames, as we said in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus, and raise the skin which is directly on the spleen where the inferior left cubit meets, and your elevation should be such that the cautery falls according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two burning flames deeply, until they penetrate the skin from the other side; then extract the cautery; thus, four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you use cauterization with another cautery, holding three wounds.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then, after releasing the pus for many days, care for the cautery, for it is more effective than any that have come before from treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	§ On the method of cauterization for hydrops.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall on hydrops unless it is properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat hydrops with the modes of treatment that we have mentioned in division, and the cure does not turn out, then it is necessary to use four cauterizations around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another on the epigastrium, one over the spleen, and two behind the back between the spines, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then, release the open cautery so that it emits pus over a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not delay the weak from treatment after cauterization with it; for it is necessary that two intentions be united to it, and it will hasten to itself with the aid of God towards healing.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery iron with which the abdomen is seared should be curved; it should follow the shape that has gone before. And the form of that with which the back is seared should be oily; it should follow the shape that has come before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Regarding the method of cauterizing the feet and crurs:
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIIII.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they have been dipped in hydropic and replenished with citron water: it is necessary to sear over the back of the foot at the instep, which is between the ankle and the toe joints; then raise your hand with the cautery, without twisting it, and afterwards raise your hand again, without touching it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The citron water will revive, and the cautery should be according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each of the two crurs at every crur, and let the cautery be done with the tip of the cautery knife; and let the cautery be according to the length of the crur, one below the knee and the other lower down, roughly in the middle of the crur; and make two cauteries over all the coxa; and leave the open cautery without care for a long time, so that some water may heal from it; then take care of the cautery as we have said with the others.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in the abdominal solution:
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXv.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the entrails has been affected by cold and humours, until the vital forces that retain and digest in the stomach and intestines become weakened, it is not truly healed but only cured, and you see the patient bearing the marks of burning vitality. Then burn that part with a great cauterizing iron over its own stomach, as was done previously with the cauterization of the stomach using a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a fine clavicle cautery; or with one large cautery above the anus, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive humidity and the patient tolerates it, then burn that part with a cautery over the chest, and a cautery over every rib; and perhaps add two small cauteries over the stomach near the larger one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	Healing is indeed effective, whose strength does not waver.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	**On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.**
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids, or one large one, derived from thick, cold, or corrupted humours, and they are treated as we have said in division, but do not improve: then burn three times over the lower spine near the anus slightly triangular, and a cautery under the navel like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled and his food not digested, and you see his face turn pale, then apply a large causter over his stomach as previously described; and another causter over his bowels, and a third over his spleen, with a caustic knife. Leave the open causter for some time, then take care of him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	In addition to the caustics, it is important to follow proper procedures after the removal of these parts.
Caput XXXVII.	**Chapter 37**
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you remove the whole (part), then light the caustic that is similar to a brand.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the burning caustic into the whole part that has been removed; and with your last hand, continue until the caustic reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many (parts), then cauterize each one with a causter as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with ointments until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you apply a large causter over the flame (part), it is the last resort in the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the instructions given for the section and operation described in its place, and is disturbed by it, perhaps he will be cured by cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula has occurred in anyone and become old, pus runs from it, and corrupted humors are discharged.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Accordingly, it is right that the fistula be probed with a delicate instrument.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then determine the depth of it with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply the cautery iron, which is similar to a radius.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the very hot iron into the fistula itself, and determine how far the clamp has entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cauterization over it until all those corrupt bodies are consumed, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And beware of burning the nerve, if it is there, or a large vein; or if the fistula extends to the urinary body, or to the intestinal body, then guard yourself from these places altogether.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not perform this unless there is a fistula in a fleshy part, and you think that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed and the materials are removed from it, and it remains like this for a long time, then know that it has already healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the materials do not separate from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a deep hole corrupted in it, or as if those (materials) remain in their place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	§ On cauterizing wounds (a method).
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When there is pain in the kidneys due to cold or excessive heat, and they are weakened by it, then one should cauterize (the affected area) with a hot iron over the kidneys themselves, with a cautery knife over each kidney, whose memory precedes it.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize (the kidney) again with a second hot iron in the same instrument.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore three lines (will appear or be evident).
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, they will be more extreme in their treatment.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the vesica (bladder).
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When there is weakness and relaxation in the bladder due to cold and moisture until it cannot retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the upper side of the bladder where the hairs begin to grow, and use a iron from the right side and another from the left side; let the length of this cauterization be according to the size of a thumb knot. And cauterize it on the lower back with an iron or two if necessary, following the same method as before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the matrix (uterus).
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When there is cold and moisture in the matrix that prevents conception and disrupts her menstruation, causing delay in its onset, so that pain occurs upon their arrival (menstruation), then it should be cauterized with three irons around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with an iron on the lower back, or two irons if necessary; let the cauterization be in the shape of a key.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing an anch (nerve) in a dislocation.
Caput XLII.	**Head XLII.**
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the humors of the mucous membrane are discharged into the anchor (nerve), they become the cause of its exit from its place; and this is indicated by the foot being prolonged over the other when they are compared together; and the place of dislocation is found hollow in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the weak part above the anchor with a similar circular cautery; after you have marked with wax around the anchors, as it is customary; and so that the anchor itself falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And this cautery, whose form precedes in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large oil cautery; and make the depth of the cautery according to the thickness of the skin throughout.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	**On the method of cauterizing in Sciatica.**
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the ankle joint, and it is caused by cold and moisture, the patient should be treated as we mentioned in division, but if this does not bring relief and the condition worsens, then the patient must be relieved of the thick humors with foul-smelling pills or artificial pills and similar remedies.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then apply a cauterization.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	The method of cauterization in this case is according to two modes: either cauterization with medicines that cause burning or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cauterization with fire is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of these methods is to cauterize over the ankle joint with three triangular cauterizations, in this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make a good or bad depth for them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space between each cauterization be the thickness of a finger; and the cautery should be oily.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	However, a cauterization is made in the middle over the top of the ankle joint itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four incisions?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you use an incision in the form of a circle, whose shape precedes the dislocation of the bone, there should be one, so that the circle contains the whole bone.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin throughout.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of incision in sciatica, when the pain adheres to the bone itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then make two incisions on the side [of the thigh], above the place where the patient feels pain, and a third incision with your four fingers towards the outer part of the thigh; this is called a scalpel incision.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the incision should be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient feels that the pain extends nearly to the toes, then make an incision there where he feels it, with a point, or three points, or four, or as many as needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he feels the pain beneath the knee towards the leg, then make an incision there with a single scalpel.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And be sure, in every cauterization that you perform, not to burn the final nerves or great arteries, and draw them through this to the inferior damage, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And indeed I have seen many who have cauterized the wound, and ended up with cauterization, so much so that the foot was inflated until a tumor developed in it, and it was completely perforated and corrupted; then there was a rupture of the abdomen, and death followed afterward.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If there is pain in both parts at the same time, cauterize them both according to this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men have said about cauterizing the anchor, whose cauterization is this method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar one from iron, whose diameter is half a palm; and it should be near its opening according to the thickness of the finger, or a little less; and within that third part should be third part again.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space between each part be equal to the length of the thumb; and make the parts open from both sides; and let their height be about a knot, or two knots; and make them a handle out of well-suited iron for the parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is heated over fire until it blazes and emits sparks. Then it is placed over the ashes of a weak patient lying on his healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, cauterize him with three round scalds in one application.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it alone for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	After that, apply a paste with butter and leave the open wound for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, "With this kind of cauterization, we are little used to it because of the fear caused by its appearance, and also because few people have learned to apply it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless, there is benefit from good cauterization for one who endures it, and he will find its place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	Cauterization with medicines is when you make two identical pieces of perforated metal, into which the pivot of its door descends from brass, or iron, of the length of the wall; and there are two knots, or something like them, at their height.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there should be a space between both pieces of the thickness of a finger, open below and above, and they should contain each other according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then he lays her down on the side of the sick person with the healthy side facing up.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly over the side of the anchor.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then make incisions between two circles using warm water heated with fire for a short while, and keep it there for as long as an hour: the patient will bear both the cutting and the burning because the pain itself is like fire until it subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe away the warm water from the anchor entirely with sweet water; then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	Place butter on it until the burning blackness disappears; then leave it for several days until pus flows from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	This is indeed the ultimate remedy.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then tend to it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or the leg: make a support for it that holds water, just as you did with the anchor, equally on both sides.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the way of hot water, and I have already written about it in the book on medical rectifications.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take some alkali and unburned lime, each one part; clean both of them and put them in a new pot, with its lower part perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that is to enter it; and place beneath the bottom of the pot another pot emptied: then throw over the alkali and lime water from sweet water, which submerges both by means of a finger: after which you compress them well with your hand and let go of the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the emptied pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then add all that water and throw it over another lime; and continue until it renews itself.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	It is indeed then very sharp and acute, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterization of the rest of the members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And there are medicines with which large wounds are cauterized, such as pitch, and turpentine, and myrrh, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen, narrating, revealed that a certain man from the ancients used a cure for which he had treated the pain of the hip and sciatic vein, and praised it as being very magnificent.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it did not need another cure, and that he was healed at once, until he returned, because perhaps he had entered the bath having been washed, and emerged from it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is taken from a fresh, green plant; if not found fresh, it is taken dry and recent, and heated with much fat, and placed over the affected area, be it pain in the foot or leg or hip, and bound, and left for three hours, or as much as the patient feels relief from the heat.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then insert it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When, therefore, the body becomes moist, insert it into the bed.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain retreats and it is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know this, for it is not necessary that anyone use a caustic with these medicines unless after evacuating the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, who said that goat dung, when used with a caustic on the sciatic vein, gives relief, and the caustic is made in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, imbue it with old oil, and place it over the deep spot that is between the toe and the ankle, and closer to the ankle.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, ignite it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wound and leave it until it is healed.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not cease to do this until complete healing is achieved and the pain has subsided.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of healing is called the vaccination burn.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	§ On the burning of the back's pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes a severe pain occurs in the back for many reasons, whether from accident or sudden jolt or excessive evacuation, and similar causes; and the burning does not cease unless in this special case which arises from the injection of cold and moist matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after evacuation of the feverish type and similar conditions, three lines should be drawn on the back where the pain is located, according to its width, and signs made with wax in every line; five or more burns, according to the amount of strength the nurse can tolerate, should then be made through these signs, and the burning completed when the cauterization is done.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize three or four times with a cautery, using a claw-shaped cautery on the midline.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	**On the method of cauterization for severe gangrene.**
Caput XLV.	**Head XLV.**
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This disease often occurs in young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its onset in children is: that a contraction occurs above them in the act of breathing, and movement; and you will find it in the lower spine and its knots, which begin to protrude above the rest of the vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you therefore see that, and wish to do that, then cauterize the very spot with a circular cautery according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery take hold over all parts of the vertebrae equally; and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebrae with a point cautery, make two or three dots, and they should be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place until it is healed as we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, do not apply cautery to the deformity that occurs in a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterization for podagra and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are caused by cold dampness that spreads to any part of the body, and when there are pains in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call it podagra properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When podagra is caused by cold, treatment should be applied in such a way that the pains are not removed, but rather cauterization is used to alleviate them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is done that after the evacuation of the joint of the feet, cauterization is applied with many cautery instruments, and this cauterization is with oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	The form of which this is.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a cautery point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	Should the pains rise up to the knees, or other joints, and this occurs frequently, then cauterize the whole knee with three cautery instruments, or four from every side, using the same cautery iron as for the claw.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If you need more than one of this cautery for your purpose, then cauterize them all.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but place it only around the thickness of the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however the pains rise to the knees and back: then administer what we said of cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pains are only in the hands, then make points around with a flame, as two lines are resolved.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If however there remains pain in the fingers, then make points on them, over every knot point, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however the pains rise after days to the cubits or shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not disregard the weak from good management, from receiving medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good management is done, and the phlegm is drawn out, it will be healed with God's help using this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	**On the method of cauterization in ruptures.**
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or the scrotal sac descends towards the testicle, and this condition begins to worsen, then it is necessary to advise the patient to stop eating and drinking on that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And it should be treated with gentle means to allow the feces to descend from its abdomen.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then he should sit between your hands on his back, and instruct him to hold his breath until he feels the expulsion of gas or the descent of the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then use your fingers to reduce the swelling, and make a mark with wax beneath the rupture over the ribcage, where the end of the sign is like half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply the hot iron whose shape is as described, until it turns white and expels pus.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or the scrotal sac back to its normal position.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then have the assistant place his hand over the area to prevent the intestine from protruding, and you, having already opened between the patient's legs and placed a poultice beneath, place another above his legs and yet another on his chest holding the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cauterization instrument over the mark, with your hand holding it straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it [the instrument], until you achieve the desired effect on the wound; or repeat the application once or twice, if you have not achieved the desired effect with it up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe the exit of the intestine at the time of your cauterization, so as not to burn it itself, and let it heal through that or become infected, or cause great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not achieve the desired effect with the cauterization instrument, your operation will be in vain.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cauterization for infants be delicate, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the remaining wounds with ointment until they heal.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And the patient should lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary to provide his nourishment for the duration of his healing time, which will soothe his bowels; so that the intestine does not come out at the anus and defecate.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then, when you want to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made ligature and hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And it becomes smaller due to labour, and filling with food and drink, and vociferous noises.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when this regimen is used, thus is healing achieved completely.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the cure for ruptures with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When ruptures occur in the rest of the stomach and are incipient, and appear as if they will not increase, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and it should be done that what is cured from thereforth becomes like a third of its original size.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then the cure itself, with what we said: and it is not to be added.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some have said: let the rupture be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is sealed with encaustic, a line is drawn which goes across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below it.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cautery clamp.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the method of cauterization for pains due to injury or impact.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in certain members due to an injury or impact that the pain persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a puncture cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And the cautery of every member should be according to its size, and its thinness or thickness, and its strength, and its position in torsion, and the pain coming from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed from the first cautery, that is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat the cautery on top of it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Since these pains have the custom of changing from one member to another that is closest to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary to follow them up with cautery until the sick member is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the method of cauterization for leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX. Head.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	However, in lepromatous patients, cautery should be applied with utmost caution.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the species of leprosy, which is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy; therefore, when considering cautery on that very condition.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If leprosy begins and you have treated it as we mentioned in the division, but it does not disappear or recede: then be wary of the infirmity that allows corruption to encompass all of its complexion; then cauterize it on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of a clearly visible spot, and a second below it turning towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two on either side above the horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally, with your hand apply the cautery for a brief moment until it makes a slight impression on the bone, causing the skin to detach; in order to release the expulsion of thick vapors from it, and cauterize it once more with cautery over the spleen, as mentioned previously.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if leprosy is now already scattered over the infirmity and appears clearly manifest: then it is necessary to apply cauteries with these cauteries that we mentioned on the head, and cautery over the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on either side of the maxillas, and two cauteries on either side of the spine of the neck, and six on the spine of the back, and one large one near the anus, and one above it; in addition to two cauteries on each ankle, namely, one over every ankle, and two over the shoulders, and two over the elbows, and two over the wrists, and two over the softness of their chest: and cauterize it over all the joints, from the joints of their fingers and toes. And cauterize over every calcaneum of their feet, and the folds of their hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And be aware of the nerves that are above the back of the heel, so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes a cautery is applied over the bones of the ribs, and another over the bone of the stomach, and another over the epigastrium.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more cautery you add, the greater the strength and the greater the benefit.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the weak do not feel pain from cautery as the healthy do; for their body is already stupified.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And the cautery should be of appropriate size and strength according to the members and joints; as it has been described in detail regarding various instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cautery with flour and herb paste with honey, and other treatments, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	**On the Method of Cauterization in Stupefaction.**
Caput L.	**Head**
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a limb becomes stupified and treated with medicines, oils, poultices, but does not heal, then cauterize the affected limb according to its magnitude or smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cauterization be through the thickness of the skin somewhat.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when it is cauterized to some state of numbness, which occurs to the hand and foot, at the spine of the back near the exit of the nerves that move that limb; then the numbness is relieved.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	Indeed, one should not presume over it unless one is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	**On the manner of cauterization according to Albucasis.**
Caput LI.	Head (LI)
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albucasis is outdated and does not bring anything new from the skills of medicine; then cauterize over that cautery deep somewhat, according to the amount of thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is relieved, and the color of it changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with a paste of herbs and lentils with rose oil, and arni-gooseleaf, and pigeon's blood, and vulture's blood: take a portion from each; mix them all together, and apply it to the cloth, and let it adhere at the site until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the Method of Cauterizing a Cancerous Growth.
Caput LII.	**Chapter LII**
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When the cancer is just beginning and it does not yet protrude much, cauterize it with a hot iron in a circular motion around its circumference as required.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	However, it has been said that it should be cauterized with the hot iron in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But I do not think that this is correct, because I am afraid it might ulcerate, and I have seen it happen several times before.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it should be cauterized around its circumference with a circular motion, as we have said, or with many hot irons.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the Method of Cauterizing an Abscess.
Caput LIII.	**Chapter LIII**
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an abscess that is delayed in maturing, or because of its excess, or because of the age and weakness of the patient, when there is little blood, or because of time, and it seems to hasten in the maturation of the abscess, then cauterize around its circumference with many small hot irons pricking.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then release her.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	It will also ripen as it matures.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	However, if you wish to make an incision in it with a cautery, then use fire for the cautery, which has this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place the same in the middle of Adubelat, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery follow from it as it proceeds, so that the course may be cleansed pure.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	§ In the manner of cauterizing, it should be done on something slightly corroding.
Caput LIIII.	Head (of the cautery)
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	The cautery that corrodes is nothing but the corruption within a moving member, and it corrupts itself; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see the corrosion at a place that can endure fire, then use many cauteries with fire, small and large ones, according to what is suitable for that place where the corrosion is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until the entire corruption is removed and nothing remains of it completely.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and place over the burned areas ground sulfur mixed with oil, until all the scabs and all the corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that nourish the flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days the flesh is born with a healthy newness in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization over what remains from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corrosive [agent] is treated sometimes with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	It indeed arises at the place of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cauterization with fire is more expedient: and I have indeed already said that its treatment with sharp medicine is in division; therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	# On Cauterization in Claws and Warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This affliction often occurs in the lower parts of the foot; it is a thick, putrid matter that injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed there is cauterization in them according to two methods: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for when using fire, it is like cauterizing with a heated iron similar to the shape of a quill; it should be made of iron containing enough claw from all sides and be thin-edged.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the heated iron on top of the claw.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn the hand with the cauterizer around the claw until the cauterization reaches the depth of the claw, and leave it for three days until it starts to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply it with a paste made from crushed garlic mixed with salt, and leave the paste on top overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It will indeed be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a healing ointment made from meat until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not improved and various occurrences happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then apply cauterization with hot water to them. It is as if you take a tube made of copper, iron, or quill, and place it over the claw or any other part.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Next, insert a small quantity of warm water into the tube: hold your hand, and twist it slightly with the pressure of your hand so that the edge of the tube is pressed against the root of the nail, and the warm water finds its way down to the root of the nail; and let the patient wait for a short time after the application of the warm water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release it, for the nail is detached along with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with each one, one after the other, until you have passed over all that are present in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they have been eradicated, with what generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	§ On the method of cauterization in tremor.
Caput LVI.	Head LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When tremor occurs in anyone due to cold in a nerve, or quartan fever, or any other cause: then it is necessary to cauterize that person four or five times over the spinal bones, and between every bone with a cautery, and also over his chest and stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor ceases with the application of oil cauterization, and hastens the healing of cold disease.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the Method of Burning (or Cauterization) according to Albucasis.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When foreign bodies, such as pustules formed from the corruption of coarse materials, are expelled from the body.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they appear (pustules), they should be burned with a delicate cautery tool made of myrtle wood, whose tip is ignited with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of the longist stem of Aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a semicircular cautery iron.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they (pustules) are burned, they should be done so after this manner, following their initial expulsion, and they do not increase; the excess is broken off, making them heal.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it should be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the Method of Burning (Cauterization) within a Blood Flow from an Artery to the Vein.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Often, a flow of blood occurs from an artery that has been cut near a wound that happens externally or near the incision of a fistula or cauterization of a limb, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to remove it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	If this should happen to someone, then quickly with your hand press over the opening of the artery, and place your index finger on top of it: and squeeze it tightly until the blood is blocked by your finger and cannot escape from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place a small oil lamp and many more of them on fire, and blow on them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one, or a few, or a large one according to the wound and place it over the artery where it is cut, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cauterization until the blood stops.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	Which if it is expelled with the removal of your finger from the opening of the artery, and the cauterization is extinguished, then quickly take another cauterization prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	He should not cease doing this with one after another until the blood stops.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, do not burn the nerve that is there, and cause another harm to the weak patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And you should know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to cut off that very artery; especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or when using cauterization, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or when using extraction, when it cannot be extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends oppose each other, and blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or they place on it medical preparations that cut off blood flow and tie them with a proper constricting bandage.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever administers the cutting off with ligature and constriction with cloth, or positioning of burning things and similar methods, does not do it thoroughly unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If this should happen to anyone and there is no present doctor or medicine: then he should begin with positioning his index finger over the wound's vein opening, as we have said, and constrict it strongly, until the blood flow stops from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And let the finger not be moved, but keep it above the cold water, continually increasing the cold until the blood congels and swells, then cut it off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, consider what it needs from cauterization or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	§ On incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds and similar conditions.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have spoken at length in the first chapter about every disease that involves fire, either through cauterization or burning medicine, along with its circumstances, causes, instruments, and types of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed chapters there from the beginning to the end.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that everything that needs to be asked is answered.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, O son, to learn from the fear that is in the first chapter about cauterization, what will be discussed in this chapter.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for this reason, it is necessary that caution be taken with greater care, because in the operation which is described in this chapter, the condition often deteriorates when there is bleeding, with which life is endangered at the opening of a vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of a fistula, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar cases; from all of these, trembling and fear arise, and in many of them death follows.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I advise you not to neglect that which causes hesitation, for sometimes people with certain conditions fall into your hands, and it is up to you to adapt to these modes of illness.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there are those who become angry with their illness, and for them death is light; because of the urgency that they find from their illness and the length of their suffering.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when illness arises from the fear of death,
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And there are those who give their last breath and entrust themselves to you with it, hoping for health, and their illness is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it is not necessary that you agree to someone who comes to you from such conditions.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more urgent than your greed and ravaging.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume over anything from that, unless after a certain knowledge which verifies with you that successful outcome to which it has come.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use all your knowledge of the care, prognosis, and treatment of all your patients, so that it is appropriate for their salvation.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	In that very thing, indeed, lies your aid in acquiring fame, glory, memory, and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	God's Spirit inspireth you, His Son, with His understanding, and do not let Him take from you guidance and inspiration, for it is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have indeed ordered this chapter to be distinguished by sections, according to what precedes in the chapter on cautery, from head to feet; so that you may find whatever you seek from it, and whatever you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	§ On the care of water collected at the joints of boys.
Caput I.	Head I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this condition often occurs in boys at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever anything happens, it is also due to an obscure cause that is unknown.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed, I have not seen this disease in others as much as in children, and to every one of them death ensued; so it has been necessary for me to abandon surgery on them.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed, I have seen a child from whom the head was swollen with water, and his head was magnified every day, until he could not sit down on himself due to the size of his head; and the swelling increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this swelling, either it is aggregated between the skin and the bone, or it aggregates beneath the bone on the surface.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on him, if there is swelling between the skin and the bone and an abscess appears, then you need to make a crack in the middle of the head in width; and the length of the crack should be like two knots, until the swelling drains.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the abscess.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If the swelling is increased even more, and the abscess becomes larger, then make those two cracks according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the swelling is beneath the bone and its sign is that you see the temples of the head open from all sides, and water sinks down when you press it with your hand towards the interior, and this does not escape you, then you need to make three cracks in the middle of the head according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the cut, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then, close the wounds with cloth and lint.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then, sew it up with wine and oil for five days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then, loosen the ligature, treat the wound with bandages and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not loosen the head equally.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the weak patient with dry food containing little moisture until the member is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And there is another method of cutting as you consider the extent of the swelling and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or at the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, with the cut, where you see the swelling and the collection of water: and split it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, do not cut the artery, and avoid a flow of blood, or the weak one will die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	On the incision of arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	**Chapter II.**
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When someone suffers from cataracts affecting the eyes or chest, and it becomes chronic and does not respond to medical treatments, then the final cure lies in the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when one decides to cut them (the arteries), it should be done so as to remove the diseased part of the head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then, using a rough cloth, make the arteries visible (by cleaning the area).
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the patient should tighten their neck using any cloth available.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse of the vein is.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both (arteries) are the areas behind the ears that are depressed; and they are rarely hidden, except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark them with wax on both; and cut each one with a sharp blade from both sides accurately towards the bone; and this should be done according to the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert a blade under the artery and cut it towards the upper parts with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And the length of the incision should be like two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is incised, blood flows out with a pulsating movement, which rises towards the inside with frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	However, if the artery is not visible to the eye, then it is necessary that the measurements from the gold should be a quantity of space equal to three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with wax and find until it reaches the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which needs to be released from blood is six ounces and perhaps you release more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of it according to the amount that appears to you from the state of the patient and the fullness of its artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains anything towards the bone from the cure, cut that so as not to allow a hot fistula; then tie the wound with linen strips.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then he should be cared for with a poultice until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries, which are in the limbs.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a person suffers from an old hemicranea, or acute catarrh due to sharp humours and heat in the membranes of the limbs, or old ulcers, painful and similar conditions, and the usual medical treatments do not help, then we resort to extracting the arteries from the limbs or cauterizing them, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of extracting them is to shave off the weak hairs from the limbs and draw attention to the visible artery in the limb.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	Indeed, it is shown to you from its pulse, and it is rarely hidden unless in a few people or severe coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then the weak person should tie his head with any cloth he has: then place fear in a rough place with the cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or place vapour in a hot water place until it appears to you with a manifest sight.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the instrument I formed earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then use the instrument to scrape the skin easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it and pull it towards the upper parts until you extract it from the skin, and make it glide out of the tunics that are below it from all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is thin: then pierce it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then make an incision from that part according to the length of its ends, and pull them against each other, so that there is no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not incised and not completely separated, the blood will not rise to its full extent.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then extract six ounces of blood, until three ounces remain.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread made of silk or catgut, so that it does not flow into the same putrefaction before the wound heals and blood flows.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then make an incision over the excess that is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Perform that procedure at that time, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you see that it is still raw, cauterize it with a hot iron up to the mouth, with a knife cautery; until its ends are formed and it takes the place of the same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better work unless the patient has fever or is of hot complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because cautery is from those things that promote the ending of moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to use cautery.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the arteries are extracted, it is necessary that the place be filled with cooked fat; and small pieces well-formed are placed on top of it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the wound is cleaned with dry medicines that promote the healing of the flesh, and with lint, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, during the operation a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then quickly proceed to cut it off with cautery, or fill the place with a plug; and tighten your hand until the blood stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those things is available to you, then place your finger on the place until the blood stops.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And when the location is embrocated with cooling water, until the sharpness rests and tightens according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is easier to extract an artery from a softer and more pliable location, it is done by cauterizing the vein with this cautery that has two knives; and the sharpness of both knives should be similar.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they have much less sharpness than the two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp like two knives, each one causes cold; and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	So, when they have a little less sharpness, heat from fire is retained in them, and flesh is cut quickly; therefore, with this, the work is better in every way and easier and lighter.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And there should be a space between the two knives equal to the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with encaustic; and put out both firebrands very quickly, until they reach the vein, and cut the vein at two places: so that what is between its extremities will be elongated.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not solidify completely with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the care of a continuous, acute flow of tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	**Head IV.**
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears flow continuously, and a stream of them flows from the eyes, which are on the outer surface of the skull, and medical treatment with remedies does not help, and you see the face of the patient already reddened, and he feels a trembling in his forehead as if it were a tremor of ants, and his eyes are weak and wet, so that their hairs are already corroded with tears, and his eyelids are inflamed from the intensity of the tears, then the ancients sought help in this treatment, and called it 'the operation with the sword'.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is as if you urge the patient to shave the hairs on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three cuts evenly spaced across the forehead according to its length; and the length of each cut should be about two fingers, with one cut placed equidistant from the middle of the nose on the forehead, a second slightly higher than the movement of the eyebrows, and a third on the other side. And be careful to avoid incising the arteries located on both sides. And extend your hand from the continuity of the lower jaw, making the distance between all cuts equal to three fingers; and have a piece of sponge prepared or a large piece of dried cloth with which to absorb the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the blade at the acute ends of both cuts, after which follows the form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the cut which is from the temporal part to the second incision; and the scar, with it, all the skin which is between the two incisions, when healed, which is above the jawbone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then make it from the median cut to the second incision as well.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this spatula, and insert another tool into the first incision again, which is called a sharp knife, one side blunt, the other side sharp.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the attached flesh with the skin, and its blunt side towards the jawbone; and push it until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut along with it all the structures that descend from the head to the eyes; except for the incision which appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then make it in the middle fissure until another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when it flows from the blood, the quantity is equal; express the places from which the clotted blood has been removed.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put into each fissure a plug made from old skin, and place over them poultices soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a fever does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, loosen the ligature and administer a large amount of infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then apply that remedy with basilic ointment to the wound, and to all other wounds as well, until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	§ On the treatment of acute tears and cataracts on the eyes from internal head injuries.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When a person suffers from acute, severe, and persistent cataracts, you will see their eyes becoming weak, with a feeble appearance, and the eyelids are damaged, and hair falls out of them, and there is a deep, sharp, painful sensation in the head, accompanied by sneezing. In such cases, take from these occurrences that these materials do not come out of the eyes unless through many openings.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you should order the sick person to scrape their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make one cut into that groove in the middle of the forehead, or another slightly narrower one on either side, and begin with the cut from the left tempora to the right tempora: and continue the incision until it reaches the bone: and extend your hand away from the jaws that move around the chewing. Until the bone is reached, then absorb all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with a hot knife or with linen lintels.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind it from above with threads: and moisten the threads with wine and oil, so that a hot ulcer does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have loosened it and see that the hot ulcer is already approaching: then you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of it with a drying treatment that promotes the growth of flesh: as if you would take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of pitch, prepare from them a paste and apply it to these wounds to promote the growth of flesh.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	§ On the care of that which falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	HEAD VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear belongs to one of four types: a mineral stone, or something similar to stone, like iron and glass; or from a plant, like chickpea and beans; or something fluid, like water, vinegar, and similar substances; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When something falls into the ear that is a stone, or of a similar type that does not add to or grow within the ear, expose the ear to sunlight: if you see the stone, then some oil from the fat or saliva may trickle into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then he should perform the extraction of the foreign body, and make the patient sneeze when ready, and press the nostrils upon approaching the sneeze, after you place a thin piece of cloth or wool around the ear and extend the ear towards the upper parts.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	This treatment often proves effective.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	However, if it does not come out, then perform the extraction with a gesture, that is, with delicate plucking using pinzette. Its form is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If it therefore comes out with the gesture, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if it does not, then perform the extraction with a fine, curved, hooked instrument with a slight curve.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it still does not come out through that, then make a tube from metal and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole deeply, and press the matter around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil so that there is no passage for air except through the tube; then extract it with a strong draw.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	This often proves effective with what we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If however it does not come out in that way, then take from the chimney or from wire, that is, prepared glue with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it on the tip of a fine radius after you have properly wrapped it around a cotton ball; then insert it easily into the ear hole after drying the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not depart with all that we have narrated, then approach to divide, before it happens a hot apoplexy, or cramp.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the manner of the incision is, as phlebotomists do in the first place on the head: and extract from his blood according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear towards the upper parts, and find a small incision in the root of the ear near the fat at the depressed place: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the stone: then remove it with what is possible to you from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that incision with your hands quickly, and treat it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the matter falling into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and inflate: then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If however it does not obey you for its exit, then take a thin, delicate spatule in this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the incision of that kind from the grains that fall into the ear, and do not think, when you consider that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put many strokes; then remove them with hooks, or with a subtle gesture, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction to be alleviated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	When water is introduced into the ear, it is necessary that the patient use a sneeze after having prepared the ear with some warm oil at first; and he has already filled his ear with some cooked oil to some extent, and lies over that ear where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out through that, then it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if it does not: then take many small stones, according to the length of your finger, thin and soft, and heat them with a little fire, and let the patient insert one of them into his ear opening; and he should pull out one from that side on top of his foot, and strike with another stone the one that is in his ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore he should not stop doing that with the stone and the stone until all the water has come out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And the water comes out so that you take one from the fire or from a coal with your finger and insert its end into the ear; and light the other end with fire until it burns most of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another twist and do that many times until all the water has come out; and extract it with a tube according to what was mentioned above in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	However, when extracting an animal that has entered it, if it is a small body, like a flea or something similar, treat it with care as I said regarding division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if there is a large body that appears to the sense, then administer its extraction with gestures and hooks; for it is easier than all that is held in gold.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	However, when treating a hernia generated in gold, and you care for it as we have said in division and distillation, but your treatment does not improve it, then you should look at the gold in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If something appears there from the hernias, then extract it with gestures or with delicate hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If nothing appears there from the hernias, then take a tube whose form is narrow below and wide above, and insert its thin end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; then suck with it strongly.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do that many times until all hernias protrude.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you for the exit, then tie the catheter around with cerate, as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not come out with what I said, then administer the distillations that the ancients have already experienced in the treatment of hernias; and you will find it in the book on distillation.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your discharge be as you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you can see, make it from silver or brass, below tightly closed with a small opening at the top large enough to insert a finger.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	It should therefore be so designed that what is within the cavity of the tube pushes outward; it must be made neatly from brass.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a rod and insert its smooth end into the tube with a proper insertion; then pour oil or any other liquid from these medicines into the tube, and place it in the ear. Then apply pressure with your hand until the oil enters the cavity of the ear, and feel it inside; and what is inserted into the ear should be slightly warm with a little fire: do not let anything cold distill into it, because medications cannot tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	**On the care of surgical wounds in the ear.**
Caput VII.	**Head VII.**
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants emerge from their mother's wombs that have not been circumcised.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has also happened to some people that the wound in the ear from a cut or born in it has required surgical treatment.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this operation is sometimes performed in a deep hole in the ear, which does not follow the usual course; and sometimes it occurs on the outer part of the ear hole, and then follows its normal course.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, what happens in the deep ear, and which does not follow the usual course of sight, is difficult to heal in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in those cases where it follows the course of sight, you should place the ear in a warm bath and examine it; then if you see the operation appearing, open it with a fine forceps, whose form follows this: its end should have some slight width, and one part of it should be acute; and the rest of the forceps should be made of two soft sides, so as not to harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If the operation is caused by flesh grown in the ear canal: then hold it with a fine hook and cut it away easily until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the operation is in the deep ear: then take a thin, soft, and heated radius with some fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel the operation with that which the patient feels with great hearing difficulty, try to open it easily; and be careful not to wound the ear's nerves.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Next, insert into the wound a quantity of lint according to the size of the opening you have cleaned with Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are free from the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take the lint, and immerse it in rosewater, then sprinkle over it powdered treacle, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see that the wound has begun to heal: then you should remove the lint and replace it with new lint that you have immersed in the cerate made with rose oil, until the heat of the healing subsides; then take care of it until it is completely healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, there is bleeding: then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the wound; use the remaining treatment as described in the distillation process to stop the bleeding.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	**On the care of eyelid inflammation.**
Caput VIII.	**Chapter VIII.**
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These inflammations of the eyelids occur when they are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, you must hold them with pincers or a hook and cut them off at the roots with a blade.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place a tri-folded veil over the wound.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	However, if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lens-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterize them, it is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Indeed, they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	§ On the care of the granulated eyes.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It often happens in the eyelids that something similar to granule in its strength and hardness is formed, and because of that it is called Granular; and it is a thick aggregation of moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation on them is therefore such that you should consider then, if the Granule is proceeding in it, which appears from the eyelid, and they move to every part, and its condition is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, find the gap (fissure) over it by width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it off from all sides easily until it is smooth.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	However, if you do not prepare to cut it off, except after you have penetrated the eyelid with a slight incision, then it will harm the sick person in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the fissure is large: then gather it with stitches and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, it will not cause you harm from that.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	Blood will restore it and make it flesh again.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the declivity is great towards the inner part of the ear towards the surface within, then turn the eyelid inside out and hang the lump with a hook; besides needing an incision, press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is lengthened with an incision, it will not harm anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then he washes the eye after making an incision with a mixture of water and salt, and treats the place with something that promotes healing until the patient recovers.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	**On the care of eye sockets.**
Caput X.	**Chapter X.**
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	The adips (tears) produced in the upper eyelid socket is a common occurrence in children, causing their eyes to water and leading to cataracts in the morning, preventing them from seeing sunlight, as tears flow into their eyes; this causes them to rest their faces down and sleep on their eyelids, which become damp due to the accumulation of moisture. The prominent appearance of the adips can be felt when you press the area with your fingers.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of treatment is to have the patient lie down on your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare it with care, making a circle from it according to the amount of adips contained by the eye socket from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it over the eye socket and press from all sides with your fingers to collect the adips in the center of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then it is found in the middle of that humidity with the knife cutting the cracks across the width, and there is no crack larger than that which is made in phlebotomy deep within.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	He must therefore find the entire skin, until he reaches the axira, for axira proceeds from the crack according to the form of the white, fat-like fragment.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore, extract it with the cloth that you have inserted between your fingers towards the exterior, and turn your hand to the right and left until it disperses: be careful, however, not to add to the crack, so as not to reach the eye with the knife and cause harm to it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	However, if the axira does not appear to you at the beginning of the crack, add to the crack with a little ease until the axira proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the site, and tighten it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are people who rub salt on it and place it into the cavity of the crack so that what remains of that humidity becomes liquid.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If, however, a fever breaks out at the site of an ulcer, treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On the ways to restore proper vision, that is, when the eyelid softens and the eye becomes irritated as if it were not supposed to be so.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond their natural course under the skin and become old: they then harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as continuous tears, eyelid softening, and opacification, until that causes the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And the restoration of proper vision takes place according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, according to what has been mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or the restoration of vision takes place through incision and stitching.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or through tubes, as I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then, with your left hand, turn the eyelids of the eye.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it turns around, then it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if it does not turn around: insert a needle into the fold where the thread is located at the lower part of the eyelid, and make it penetrate above with the thread, and place it near the individual hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs are born; then pull the thread towards the upper eyelids and turn it with the finger.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then, find the inner part of the eyelid below the added hairs with a spatula, passing from the larger tear gland to the smaller one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then, extract the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid; then mark on the eyelids with wax, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for it varies greatly among humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From them indeed there are those who need to be incised from the eyelid in a great quantity, according to the amount that is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, using the scalpel, find the two lines that you marked and begin from the larger tear to the smaller one, and there is one fissure near the natural hairs, as in the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then strip off the entire skin from that area.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then sew together the two edges with a needle and fine thread, drain the blood, and make what exceeds from the threads stick to the upper eyelid, with some things pricking, if you want to do that; and if not, don't worry about it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and thread until three or four days; after that, take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you want, leave the wound without sewing it up, and take care of it so that it dries and shrinks.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	The eyelid should be lifted at the sealing of the wound and its closure; but it will get better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of treatment was taught by ancient doctors.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is a concern about the patient, and it is from good surgery, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And there is another method in ataxmia, which is as follows: and it is that the signs on the eyelids should form a figure like that of a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then separate or join the eyelids with three hooks according to this form, and then cut off the surplus with small scissors according to this form, with equal cuts.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If, however, it is not possible for you to hold the hook or it does not align, then take a sharp tool where there is a thread and insert it in the middle of the figure, and insert another thread near the larger tear and a second thread near the smaller tear, and join the threads between your fingers equally.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand with an equal elevation, and raise the skin above which the mark is made, as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two edges of the wound with stitches, and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, indeed, there occurs a gangrenous condition near your cut or crack, then treat that gangrene with a poultice and similar remedies from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when it happens that the eyelids turn their hairs inside out.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you must use what we have said about incisions; but the stitching of both is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the care of the axilla with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is done, as you turn the eyelids and split the gap inside, according to what I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then, with skill, make two tubes or two thin sticks; whose length corresponds to the length of the eyelid, and whose width is smaller than the space between them; and you have already cut at both ends on each side where you hold the thread.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then join each one with care to the excess from the eyelid, and tighten the two tubes on both sides with a strong tie, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin, being tightly stretched, will die, rot, and decay until it falls away on its own.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it delays, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it has healed, raise the eyelid; and then the hairs will not hurt.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of the two tubes, which you make according to this figure, and the quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the elevation of the punctate pilars (or vessels) in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation is as follows: take a fine, sharp needle and insert it into the eyeball with a thin, flexible thread of silk.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather the ends of it, and tie each with a very thin knot; and the length of the threads should be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then, under these threads, compose another very thin thread in an alternating pattern, and tie the ends of it if you see fit.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then, the patient should place his head in your lap, close to the light, so that the operation is shown, for it is a delicate or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then, insert the needle with the silk thread into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you extract it from above the natural pillar.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then, pull the thread up to above the silk threads, and insert that thread into the silk threads; if it is one, or two, or three (threads), not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand along with it until the hair comes out together with the hardened eyelid and like a natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	However, if the hardened eyelid is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, pull the eyelid towards the lower part, using the thread that you have made in it, until the eyelid comes out from the upper opening, and you see the eye. Then pull the eyelid and the thread, and extract both of them, and close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place again, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate it with a longer hair from its natural hairs and pull them together, or leave it until it grows out to a certain length, and then pull it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	§ On the care of the alxatration (or hardening) that occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Head XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this alxatration (hardening) occurs on the eye, it is called leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this alxatration (hardening) is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental alxatration (hardening) occurs due to the healing of a wound, or cut, or cauterization, and similar processes.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the manner of operating is that you should find that consolidation, and separate its lips, and place therein a linen lintel, and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And you must not use things that drain and constrict in its treatment; for if you do so, it will return to Alxatratus worse than before. Rather, use things that soften, such as chamomile: boil it in water with althae seed and linen, and apply a ointment made liquefied with some oil; and wrap the lintel with it and care for it thereby.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasury of your care is that you should preserve every faculty so that it does not harden according to the form it had in the beginning.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this very operation that we have described is nothing but a correction of Alxatratus, so that it does not return to the form of the place according to what it was completely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	§ Regarding the care of Alxatratus that is done on the lower eyelid, and it presents as a bulge or contraction upwards towards the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Head XIIII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This condition of Alxatratus below is what is truly called Alxatratis.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	It is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And accidental injuries occur from wounds, or cracks, or cauterization, and similar conditions.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation is as follows: you take a pair of scissors, where there is a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear to the right tear, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh towards the upper parts with a knife, and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If the shape of the eyelid thus returns to what is necessary, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if it does not, take a pin, and put it into the crack, and turn the eyelid with it; and find two cracks on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of these two cracks be at the two angles of the cut, until they meet and form an angle: until, when they are joined, this figure is restored, and it becomes a Greek letter omega.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh according to the length of its sharp lower side from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separate parts; use a woolen thread for that.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the softening medicines and bandages until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an injury to the eyelid occurs from a crack, and it needs stitching or cauterization, then one should find a flat spot for the crack beneath the eyelids' hairs, according to what preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, as we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And in conclusion, regarding the care of an eyelid, whether it is above or below, the treatment should proceed as per the preparation from Albucasis' method.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	Indeed, it (the eyelid) varies greatly in form: a prudent artisan prepares the treatment with whatever means possible, until it restores the figure to its natural form or nearly so, and itself heals, as appropriate for him from the operation and tools in various arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	§ On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Head XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	This hardening occurs in many people such that the upper eyelid becomes stuck to the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, it is necessary that you insert the tip of the radius under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; then incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharp like the spatulas used for incision, but rather slightly obtuse: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed without causing harm to the eye with its sharpness, and the adhesion is removed easily until the eyelid returns to its natural form and the adhesion is healed completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then apply to the eye a salty water, either by washing it with water or by dropping some distilled water made from a dissolved compress in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid and the eye with a delicate thread; place a cloth soaked in albuginac on top of the eye, and use a compress and warm applications for three days until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	§ On the incision of the nail and the prominence of the flesh around the tear ducts.
Caput XVI.	Head XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You should know that the nail has two types of attachment.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Either it is bony, resembling a hard and thin needle, or it is like a nerve, soft and delicate.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	It is not nerve-like, but resembles frozen white humidity: when it touches a hot iron or tries to grasp it with a hook, it separates and the hook does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And each of these conditions does not begin unless it is preceded by a greater tear, which gradually increases until it blocks the vision and obstructs light and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation for this cut is to have the patient place their head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open their eyes and lift the eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take a hook with a few twists and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle and insert it through the eye with a thread from a horse's hair, or a thin wire: make sure the thread is strong and tie both ends of the needle slightly, fixing it in the middle of the nail. Then pierce the eye with the needle and bind the nail with the thread, extending it upwards. And pull on the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were squeezing it with the hair until its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remaining part at the base of the tear duct with a fine spatula or small scissors, leaving the natural meat of the tear duct intact so that it does not cause a continuous flow of tears from the wound.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail extends with a single hook, or with a thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it will be scraped with a soft spatula, which has this shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And because the spatula should not touch the corneal tunic, it might cause a rupture in it and the pupil would be perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, pour into the eye some crushed salt, or something made from a mixture of spices, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of it as necessary until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not bony and you cannot insert an axe into it, nor does a hook figure in it, then this type of nail heals often with medicine, and it recovers as if divided.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you need to cut it, then open the infected eye and take a soft, thin, weak spatula according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the nail from above with care using a thin instrument.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it thins and contracts, and the shape is impressed on it, then from your own preparation pour into the eye at that moment some spice, or red lead, or finely ground salt; and bandage the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the procedure over the entire area until it is completely removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is no sign of heat in the affected eye, leave it alone and treat the ulcer until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation over the same area with reason until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the prominence of the tissue causes great inconvenience to the eye, it should be suspended with a hook and cut from that part, but not the final cut, so as not to disrupt the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then stop the flow of tears, either because it is red or due to inflammation, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	§ On the incision of the Alguardene (a specific surgical technique) and the flesh grown in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Head XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	In some human eyes, a red flesh is sometimes born, either composed or overlaid, until it covers the pupil, draws near to it, or tightens on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it resembles a rosebud.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it is also such that it places the weak head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then he opens her eyes and collects all that flesh with hooks fitting to it; and holds it with one forceps or with gestures.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then he incises the flesh at first until it is completely finished with the knife.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful from the eye so as not to hurt it during the operation; and let your cut be where you are cutting it, or with a spatula, which we have described in the chapter on the nail cut, or with small forceps, with which the flesh is collected according to its shape after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your cut is complete and all the blood has been drained, then fill the eye with crushed salt or sprinkle it with red powder from corrosive medicines; and place a cold compress on the outer side of the eye with alum so that it is protected from heat and gangrene.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If there remains something from the blood loss and you feel hot blood and fear a hot gangrene; then release the eye and care for it with whatever calms the gangrene.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with the added flesh that occurs in the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that with every weak eye, cure should be applied either by the natural way or by the accidental way, through operating with a tool: and do not introduce your hand into any of these operations until you understand that that member can endure that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	§ On the removal of a sebum plug from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	**Chapter XVIII.**
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	The sebum plugs (or "sebels") are red veins that form over the eye and prevent its natural function, and they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, it is necessary for you, first of all, to consider whether the eye in which there is a sebum plug (Sebel) is strong and has no other illness besides the Sebel, then collect (or remove) the Sebel from that eye.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is necessary to encourage the weak one (patient) to place his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then hang those veins with one or two hooks according to your discretion: and the hook should be a thin one of double plication, formed in this way, or there may be two hooks in one body, graduated according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then carefully collect those veins with subtle forceps and gently remove the blood drop by drop until you see the veins moving out of the eye and they resolve, and be careful not to harm the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the midday before the sun, and be firm in your operation greatly: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have extracted it, then it will trickle into the eye either with a green or red color: so that its acuteness corrodes what remains of the pus.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If, however, it is not possible for you to collect all of that at once in that time, then apply a compress to the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye; and leave it for several days until the pain is settled; and protect it from further harm by warmth; then repeat over it according to the same method until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	§ On the reduction of Arissat to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Head XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The surgeons of Arissat call the fistula, which they treat with cautery or acute medicine, as described in their preceding account.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it; unless you find a gap at its origin and extract all the moisture and pus that is in it until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When, therefore, the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackening therein, then cut it with this instrument, which has this shape.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the "Asperi capitis," or the "Scalpel.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of steel, and let its head be rounded like a diamond, which is marked with a fine point of the knife or a thin chisel; and place it over the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then, hold it between your fingers, and press it slightly with your hand, until you know that the corruption is completely shaved off; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then, restore the area with absorptive medicinal powders.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If, therefore, the area hardens, and flesh grows there, and the discharge of pus ceases; and it remains for forty days without any further discharge or relapse, then you will know that it is already healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill involved, except to reopen the fistula to the nasal passage, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, as you remove the bone a second time with steel or sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take the drill according to this form, let its end be pointed like a triangle; and the wood of its handle is tapered towards the end, as you can see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it over the eye itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and stretch your hand away from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then bend your hand with the knife, until it penetrates the bone, and feel if the patient feels weak: by which he finds the flow of blood coming out from it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, at that time, restore the place with astringent medicines that dry up, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh is formed and the place hardens: then the matter that was exuded to the outside returns to the nose: thus it becomes lighter over the weak part.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	## On Reducing the Protrusion of the Eye
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with its entire globe, and there is no pain or reduction in vision, nor any diminution: then you should relieve the weak part: then use phlebotomes on it: after that, place moistened gauze on the skin without scraping, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place over the eye a linen dressing made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then, close the eye firmly above the plaster with many small particles.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the manner of the particles is that you should take many soft cloths, and double each cloth four times, making many layers, then place them one on top of another according to the need of the eye, and finally close them firmly with a strong hard cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the process with suction without scarring.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the bandages and leave the eye closed both day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	However, if the ligature becomes soft again, it should be tightened more strongly; then, after a day and night, remove the ligature as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see that the eye has regained its new skin, it is good; and if not, repeat the bandage, and the particles, and the tightening, and the suction until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	## On the Incision of the Skin Tunica
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When there is a rupture in the skin tunica, then it protrudes and extends beyond the eyelids like a grain, causing disfigurement of the face because of that, and one should cut it; then the operation on it is as I will describe: and it is, as you insert an acute knife into the root of the lid from below towards the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Next, insert another needle where there is a double thread from the tearful side, and make it penetrate; then let the first needle go according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Next, incise the location of the double thread, and tie it with the edge of the needle around its circumference; then tighten it greatly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract the needle, and place on the eye a cloth soaked in alum; and leave it until the thread falls with the tear.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, so that it is strengthened until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the tear is drawn from all sides with the circle of cloth, until the eye acquires a great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a delicate instrument that reaches the depth of the eye, and the moisture of the alum runs out, and the eye descends and enters immediately; then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	**On the cure of alum (Alcomnati)**
Caput XXII.	Head XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This affliction called Alcomnati is not, but rather a health that collects in the eye, similar to water flowing down, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operation is such that you make the invalid sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head in both hands and move it until you think the blood has reached the lower part of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is stabilised, and it does not fall, and the light is restored: and the invalid sees things as he used to see them: and if it does not descend below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	However, if the descent of the blood is not prepared as we said, then make the invalid sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spatula and find it slightly above the corny membrane, near the connection of the joint with the corneal tunic in the crown, until the blood flows out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When the blood has thus flowed out, then pour warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have already boiled fennel and honey; then it is treated with the rest of the cure until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	§ On the care of water that flows into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Head XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have previously discussed the types of water in division, and those that are suitable for perforation, as described in the discourse and explanation, then take it [water] according to its health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Therefore, you should make the infirm person sit with their face squared towards your hands, opposite to the light, near the sun. Then bind their healthy eye tightly and press it hard. Afterward, with your right hand, if the affected eye is on the left, hold the eyelid of the left eye, or with your left hand, if the affected eye is on the right, hold the eyelid of the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take your right hand (or left hand if the eye is on the left) and apply alum to it.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the alum near the edge of the eyelid, according to the thickness of the radius, at the white part of the eye where the tear duct is visible. Then push the alum with force and turn your hand with it until it penetrates into the eyeball. And you will feel that the alum has already reached the hollow part.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the distance traveled by the alum to reach the depth should be measured according to the space from the pupil to the end of the black part: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will indeed see that in the same pupil of the eye, due to the clarity of the cornea's tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almand (almond) paste up to the place where water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press the same part once below, after another above.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the patient should see that over which he opens his wound immediately, and almond paste in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then place it down a second time, except that almond paste should come out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it (the wound) is closed and does not rise up: then extract the almond paste easily, and you return your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water some clear salt of gem (stone): and wash the eye with it internally.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place over the eye the whole pad, or cloth soaked in rose oil and alba (a white substance, possibly alum): and bind it with it the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those of our time, place on it ground cumin (cumin) crushed with alba (a white substance, possibly alum).
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the surgeon does not obey you and enters the eye due to its hardness, since the eye of man is hard in a great way, then it is necessary that you take a spatule, called an Alberid, which has this form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, when performing this procedure, only connect the proper joint and do not use your entire hand in the wound channel; it is only necessary to create a narrow space for the surgeon.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the surgeon according to what we said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And for the completion of your work, prepare an infirmary bed decently made, in which he should sleep on his back in a dark room; and let all movements be prohibited, as well as coughing; and provide him with that food by which nature is soothed; and let him not move his head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And the bandage should be left according to its disposition until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that dark room and examine his vision; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary for him to do this during the hour of healing or immediately after cutting; on the contrary, he should let someone else do it; because water ascends quickly through a freshly cut wound.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary to drain the eye before the seventh day: and straighten it with something that soothes the abscess until it is healed: then absolve its sight, and place on top of its face an oral application that regulates its sight for some days, while it remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then it should gradually leave the house and return to its case.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in zeal the student is not excused from sight for some time: then indeed he dares to engage in surgery.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed, some of those from Al-Andalús have now come to us, who said that something had been done in Al-Andalús, a pierced magdan through which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Therefore, no one has ever been seen in our land to have done that; nor is it mentioned in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the shapes of species of magdas so that it stands on those who ignore them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	They should be made of proper air: and their ends should be triangle-like with the same subtlety, and the acute end.
Formae magda.	Great forms.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of flesh grown in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Head XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes various types of flesh grow in the nose, among which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from this comes cancerous, stone-like flesh, of a dark color; and from this comes soft flesh, not of a dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, for that which is soft among these meats, neither frail nor cancerous, you must make it sit between your hands opposed to the sole, and open its nostrils, and insert a hook into those meats; then pull them out towards the outside, and cut what you have taken from them with a thin, sharp spatule on one side, until you know that all the flesh has already been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains from that whose separation is not possible, then scrape it with a thin tool easily until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood dominates you or a hot abscess occurs: then oppose it with what is necessary; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then apply cauterization to it until the blood stops and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Next, after making an incision, pour vinegar or water onto the nose.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	However, if the nose opens up and moisture flows from it to the palate, then you will know that it is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If indeed moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that there is a growth inside the upper bones of the nose, to which the surgical instrument did not reach.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Therefore, you should insert a line of thread with some thickness and knots in it; place the space between each knot equal to a finger, or less: then twist it weakly, sending one end of the thread into the nose with a curve, or as much as possible after making it similar to a hook: and pull its scent until it reaches the base and comes out above its throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed, many children do this like atoms in schools: and it is an easy matter for whoever wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Next, place the two ends of the thread: one end that emerges above the nose, and the other end remaining inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then, using the assistance of the knots on the thread, apply pressure to the flesh where the knots are.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Continue with that treatment until you know that the flesh is already united with the nodes by threads.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then extract the thread and place it in the nose after bloodletting using the Egyptian ointment; do this for three days or longer, until the ointment has entirely dissolved what remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then, at the end of the process, insert a lead pipe into the nose for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	However, if further treatment is required to drain it, use that method.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the purification of the head, when oils are distilled and other medicines are applied to the nose, make it from silver or bronze; which should be similar to a small lamp, open like a conch shell, and its passageway likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make the pipe closed like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the conch-shaped instrument used for head purification should be hollow and open; it should have a handle at its end, with which you can hold it when heating oil or any other liquid inside, or when applying things that become fluid.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the care of the nose.
Caput XXV.	**Chapter 25.**
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often, a growth on the tip of the nose is born, and it swells and grows larger with each passing day until an agreement is made about its appearance.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of this, it is necessary to remove that growth at its initial appearance and eradicate the whole of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then apply to the site either a caustic, or a burning medicine that takes its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If the incision is delayed until the growth has swelled and become hard, dark-colored, of little sensitivity, then do not touch it with iron; for it is a malignant cancer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Often, I have seen that when a person cuts out an apostema (a type of growth), it results in great harm to him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the apostema is soft to touch, not dark-colored, and you see that an incision can be made throughout it, then encourage the sick person, and cut out the growth without fear or hesitation, and treat the wound with what extracts and constricts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the stitching of the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	**Head XVI.**
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when there is a rupture of the continuity of one of these cartilage structures, only a little skill is required to repair it, except in certain cases.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when any part of it happens to be affected, you must consider whether the wound is recent and still oozing its own blood; then stitch the wound in two places with sutures; afterward, take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the continuity of the lips has already been separated and one part has become healthy, then it is necessary to remove the scabs from all parts that are visible on the skin until they bleed.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then stitch together the two lips with sutures and tighten them; sprinkle over it dragon's blood and pounded frankincense, and place a fragment of a medicinal paste above it, and use either another patch from a consolidative plaster or any other suitable plaster; leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it and change the medicine; leave it until the stitches dissolve on their own.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of sewing is to aggregate the solution of continuity, or with a pad, as we have described in the sewing of the entrail; or to aggregate the solution with thread, as I have made you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	**On the Extraction of Nodules of the Lips**
Caput XXVII.	**Head XVII**
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people suffer from hard spots inside their lips, often resembling small grains of herb, and some are smaller while others are larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary to bend the lip and find each node, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it off from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then, after the cut, fill the place with a clean cloth until the blood stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place treated with it where there is stiffness, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	**On the Incision of Flesh Growing Above the Gums**
Caput XXVIII.	**Head XVIII**
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Many times flesh is born over the gum that the ancients call ablucs.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you suspend it with a hook, or hold it with pincers, and cut it near its root, and let the blood flow, or the bloodletting be performed.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place over the wound a third layer of bandages or other stoppers, drying agents.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If the flesh returns after healing, as it often does, then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	§ On the reason for teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Head 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes teeth become encrusted on their surfaces from the inside and outside, between the gums there form hard, painful, and sometimes discolored cortices that turn yellow and then decay from that point until they become infected through the teeth.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you must make the sick person sit between your hands, and rest his head in your lap, and rub the tooth with a smooth stone until the hard patches disappear, and do the same for blackness, whiteness, yellowing, and other discolorsations until they are gone.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If what is in them from the beginning of reason can be removed, it is good; and if not, then continue to reason over them again on another day, second, third, until the ultimate study is reached in that which you see.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that a tooth needs to be shaped by various tools of different forms, according to what is prepared for your operation; for the tool that shapes the tooth from its lower part is different from the tool that shapes it between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these shapes of tools should be prepared for you, as you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	**On the Extraction of Teeth Pain**
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary to cure the tooth from its pain with all skill, and do not hurry in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For indeed, what I have seen does not replenish the tooth after its extraction; for it is a precious substance: until there is no excuse for its extraction, then when the patient is compelled to extract it, he must do so firmly and certify to you that the painful tooth has been extracted.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many times the patient is deceived by pain, and thinks that it is in a healthy tooth and extracts it; then the pain does not retreat until the diseased tooth has been extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we now see that is from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the painful tooth itself is certified to you as sound, then it is necessary that you make an incision around the tooth with a scalpel, in which there should be something of power, until the gum is dissolved from every part; then gently move it with your fingers, or gradually with fine forceps at first, until it is cut through.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps firmly on that spot, and grasp the head of the tooth between your fingers, holding it firmly so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and insert them under it from every part with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then you should fill that hole with cloth, and tie it tightly with the tip of a thin wire so as not to break it when you apply your forceps on top.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you handle the incision around the gum very carefully from every part much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength so as not to break it, and let the part remain, and return from that illness due to its greater harm that caused the first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And furthermore, do not do what the ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and overconfidence regarding its removal, apart from administering what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Indeed, they often delve into great weaknesses in men, which are more difficult to break, and all the roots of these remain, or certain parts of them, or they extract it with some jawbones, as we have been testified many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be washed after its removal with wine, or vinegar, and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If there is a flow of blood from the wounds (which often happens), then apply some bandage and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if it does not stop bleeding.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of the pliers should be delicate, with long tips, a short handle, and a thick head, so that they do not double over when pressed against a tooth; they should be like you see with the thick handles, until when you squeeze them, they do not bend or double over themselves; they should have short extremities, and be made of good iron or some other material carefully formed, and at their tips should be teeth, some of which enter into certain places and grip tightly with constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the extremities become like the shape of an eagle's beak, which is called a crook, and they possess strong constrictive power.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured mandible bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When, during the removal of a broken tooth, something remains stuck in the socket, it is necessary to place a custom plug there with butter for one or two days until the socket softens; then insert the proper forceps or pliers, the ends of which are shaped like the beak called the ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The shape of these forceps is as follows:
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	The ends of these forceps are shaped like a sawtooth or like the blade of a skinner's knife.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If, therefore, it does not obey you in coming out with these forceps, then you must make a cut on the root and remove all the flesh, and insert an instrument called a small lever, which is shaped like this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Its end should be short and not too thick; it should not be soaked to avoid breaking.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If, therefore, the root comes out through it, it is good; if not, it should be cut with other instruments of these shapes.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular extremity, which has a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the delicate triangular extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also cut with this instrument having two branches, of this form.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that preceded it in terms of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It is also gripped with this instrument that resembles a large hook, of the form of a twisted triangular extremity, which has certain thickness so as not to break, and it is not soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you should know that there are many instruments of teeth, and similarly the other instruments are not counted; a prudent artisan, subtle in his art, found this very instrument himself, according to which he intended to perform the operation and cure the illness itself.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because from the illnesses to which they were not accustomed to an old instrument, due to the diversity of species of them.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	However, if the bone breaks from the jaw or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies; then it should be examined in its place with what is appropriate for it from among the instruments and pincers I mentioned regarding the extraction of roots, and cut with movements, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Sit in it something of a thickness gradually, so that it may be drawn together or held with it a bone, and let it not escape or waste away, until the bone is removed; then restore the place with suitable medicines for that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	However, if there is a small putrefied part on the bone, remove it from its own putrefaction and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the locking of the prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Head XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When the teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ugly form results from it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, the vulvas.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary that you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth grows after another and is not moved or has no possibility of being locked or filed, then it should be extracted; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it off with this instrument, which has this form.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar in shape to a small face, and it is made of iron, with an extremely sharp end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be such that it penetrates just as far as you need for many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other tooth is disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	However, if it protrudes prominently from its excision: then the edge of the knife itself is smoothed with another knife, whose shape is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It should be entirely removed from the root, and its handle has small notches like a needle; with which the tooth is smoothed gradually over many days without disturbing it, and it falls out; then it becomes smooth, finally very thin with some rasors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If a tooth breaks off and injures the tongue, then its edges must be filed until the roughness of the fracture is removed and it becomes smooth; it should be smoothed out, so as not to injure the tongue or disrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	**On the relationship between teeth and golden threads.**
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth suffer a shock or disturbance from impact or accident and the weak patient cannot hold them tightly enough to prevent loss, and treatment with astringent medicines fails to heal them; then there is in them a property that causes them to cling together when bound with golden wire, since gold remains bright and does not corrode even after many days, unlike silver which turns black.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be of a middle size according to its quantity that it can hold between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	The shape of the retraction is such that you should take hold of the thread and insert its double length between two healthy teeth; then, weave it with both ends of the thread among the moving teeth, or a single one or multiple ones, until you reach the fabric up to the healthy tooth of the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texture until you reach the part from which you began; and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it does not move at all: and let your grip on the thread, near the roots of the teeth, be firm so that it does not slip.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors; aggregate and twist them together; insert them between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth, so as not to harm the tongue; then let go gently until it remains tight.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it loosens or is cut, tie them again with another thread and it will remain stable with it for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth, and the shape of the retraction of two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, as you can see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when a tooth becomes loose or two teeth fall into their places and remain as we have described, it is not achieved by anyone other than an experienced, prudent, and skilled artisan.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a certain bone becomes inflamed, and it takes the form of a tooth, and is placed back in its place, from which the tooth is supported and tightened, as we said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	On the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, which prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Head XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is to open your lower jaw at its base in your palm, and lift up your tongue; then cut through that nerve ligament across its width until the tongue is released from its attachment.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something of hardness and knotting in it, and it arises from the healing of a wound, then insert an hook into it and find its width, until you cut through the ligament, and the knot is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, so that there is no fissure deep in the flesh, and you cut through that artery, and there is bleeding.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then the wound is washed with rosewater, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a piece of linen that the patient can hold throughout the night, so that it does not harden again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If, however, there is bleeding, then apply a triple bandage to the site.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If indeed the blood is severe, then cauterize the site with a hot iron suitable for that part: then tend to it as well as the rest of the wound until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	§ On the extraction of the ranula, which is done under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes there occurs under the tongue a swelling similar to a tiny toad, which obstructs the natural function of the tongue: and it may become so severe that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the treatment for this is to open the patient's mouth before the sun, and consider the swelling.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see that it is of a pale or dark colour, hard, and without sensation on the part of the patient, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it has declined to whiteness with moisture, then insert a hook into it and cut it away with a fine knife, freeing it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood clots during your surgical procedure, place a crushed veil over it and remove the clot until all the blood is drained; then return to your operation until you extract it along with its contents.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it is wrapped with vinegar and salt, and the wound is cared for as necessary until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	§ On the treatment of an apthous ulcer between the two mandible glands.
Caput XXXVI.	Head XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat's glands, resembling little cotton balls, which appear outside; and these are called two amygdales. When you treat them as we have described above, and they do not heal, then consider this.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If it is then an acute ulcer, dark-colored, with little sensitivity, do not touch it with a knife.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red-colored, and its root is thick: then do not touch it with a knife, fearing blood flow, but leave it alone until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it, or it will rupture on its own.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	If it is of a white colour, round, and its root is thin, then it must be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is such that you consider your previous operation, if the abscess has completed its heat quietly or is reduced by some diminution: then, therefore, make the sick person sit before the sun, and let his head be in your lap, and open his mouth, and have the assistant take hold of his tongue between his hands, and press it downwards with the instrument, whose form this is.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	It should be made of silver or bronze, which is as thin as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you have pressed the tongue against it and the abscess appears and drops onto your finger, then take a hook and fix it in the groove, and extract it as much as possible towards the outside, except that you pull with it some of the tunic.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with the instrument, whose form follows this:
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is treated with shears; however, its tips should be protected so that the opening of each one faces the other's sharp edge: hence it should be made of iron or coated with a substance (the text does not specify).
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is as follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	A sharp point from one side, not from the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut through one of the intestines, cut the other according to this same pattern of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, wash the wound with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, there is bleeding, wash with water in which cortices of madder roots have been boiled, or leaves of myrtle and similar herbs from astringents, until the bleeding stops; then care for the wound until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when other spots appear in the throat, apart from the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore cut those according to what I have said about the cutting of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself have already treated a woman from a spot [in her throat] that had been born, which was drawing her towards darkness, with little sense, which was almost closing her throat; and the woman was breathing through a narrow opening, and she had forbidden herself eating and drinking water; and she would have reached death if she had remained for one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the spot would only rise so far that it emitted two branches, until they emerged above the two nasal openings.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	We therefore proceeded with haste and fixed one of their hooks.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it straight, and a large portion came out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I severed it where I grasped it from the nostril's opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I prepared for it what protruded from the other nostril's opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue; then I fixed a hook into the opening itself, after which I severed part of it, and nothing came out but a little blood; thus is completed the throat of the woman, and she began to drink water immediately, and afterwards she took some food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I therefore did not cease to make cuts from that opening for a very long time; and an opening succeeded the place where I was cutting until it became too long and when she could no longer endure it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore devised a plan, and cauterized the opening between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	She therefore stopped bleeding; then I moved away from the side, and I did not know what God had done to her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	§ On the cutting of the bird's throat.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the lung and becomes chronic and persistent, it is then called perpendicular. And if it is in the lower part thick, rounded, then it is called a uua.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured by the method we described in division, and treatment does not help, you will see that the abscess has cooled down and become thin; then it is necessary to incise it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And the rounded aggregate that is not elongated and is of a bloody or pale or black color without sensation, then it is necessary to carefully make an incision in it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For indeed, there is fear of damage when making an incision into it.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the way I have described in terms of its whiteness and length, you should make the affected person sit before the sun, and press its tongue with the instrument mentioned previously; then fix a hook in it and pull it downwards, and make an incision in it with one of the two instruments used for incising the tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary not to make an incision from that unless the portion added beyond the natural limit without adding anything.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut further from it, you will injure the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then, after the cut, use what we have mentioned about the two glands' incisions; and care for it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the patient becomes worse after the cut, then you must use your skill for cauterization without fear or alarm.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	The method of cauterization is not applicable there unless with sharp water; and it is as if you place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take the water I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and make a ball of it not too wet or dry, and place it not too thick nor too thin in this instrument's cavity, whose shape is as follows.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Place the tip of it over the part where the medicine is applied, just as the concave part of the radius' coil.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the same wound: and have the patient lying on his side so that the salt from his mouth flows out due to the medicine's inherent properties, without any of it descending into his throat and harming himself.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And from the beginning, place it on the wound with the quantity of a half hour, until you see that it is already healing and the pain has subsided through the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a poultice and apply it directly over the end of the radius and insert the poultice with the medicine into the tube from above, until the poultice adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then allow it to fall away: for it will indeed heal and drop off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to apply more medicine, apply it again: after cauterization, clean around the wound with a cloth dipped in butter and purify it with what is around it from the medicine; then bind it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it will heal externally with bandages, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This, therefore, is the kind of cure that is healthier through cutting and longer-lasting from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes even a wound that is subtler than cauterization and incision is cured with this method, namely with suffumigation.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take some calament, hyssop, oregano, rut, fennel, chamomile, and abrotum, or similar herbs; mix them all together, or some of them in a pot, and soak them in vinegar, boiling: the pot should be sealed with decent clay: there should be a hole in the middle of the pot for the insertion of the surgical instrument according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	It should be made of silver or bronze; the end with the pomegranate is inserted into the lower part of the wound until steam rises to the surface through the tube, blocking the wound significantly.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat this over the same area many times until it heals.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And be careful not to perform this cure at the very beginning of the onset of the apothema.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For indeed, it adds pleasure to the apothema, and you should not perform that unless at the turning point of the apothema's heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and wrap it with cloth at the tip; this prevents the lower bone from burning, as the cloth of the reed prevents the steam from burning the bone, and this is a good cure that brings health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone, or a fish spine, or something else, adheres in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, you must extract what is apparent among them, upon which the discharge falls, after you have pressed the tongue with an instrument at the root, and it will be declared to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before food has been digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps something attached will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the patient swallows a piece of raw cloth, or a root of lettuce, or a crust of dry bread; or takes up a piece of soft, dry sea sponge and ties it with thread, then swallows it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When it has reached the place where the spines or bones are, and they have been extracted, then it (the problem) departs.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not depart with what I have said, then use an instrument of lead in this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Sit more forward than the radius bone for a short distance, and at its end there should be tenderness, which will easily permit it to enter his throat; and he himself should have his head lifted upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And he should be cautious with the touch of his epiglottis, so that it does not cause him to cough, and force the bone, or push it, or allow the doctor to insert it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	Indeed, it is better for the patient to insert it himself because of his knowledge of the location of the matter attached, and he should push it downwards or pull his hand upwards with the instrument, according to the amount prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	**On the extraction of the bloodsucker.**
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the bloodsucker is treated with those things I mentioned regarding the division from cure with medicines, and it does not yield, then consider in the throat of the patient before the sun, or near the sun after you have placed his tongue with the instrument I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your hook slips off the bloodsucker, extract it with a small hook or with delicate gestures.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them: then take a hollow tube and insert it into the throat of the patient all the way to the throat; afterwards, insert into the hollow of the tube a burning red-hot iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Perform this procedure frequently, and have the patient abstain from water throughout the day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then he should take a full cup of cold water and open his jaw in it; he should then suck on his own bone with it, without swallowing any of the water, and move the water from one hour to the next with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For immediately when he feels the water, the suction cup falls.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If, however, it does not come out as we described, then smoke the patient with lice or with a tool like that which I described for the fumigation of the eye.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this frequently, as it will fall by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the manner of operation in fumigation is to take a pot, in which there are young shoots with fire, and the pot is covered with a lid, in which there is a hole, and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then he should release the fumigation and place his jaw at the end of the tube, and close his jaw so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has reached the suction cup.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the suction cup will fall immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat the application of sweat many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the weak person should endure thirst, eat spicy foods and other things, but not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, it is necessary to depart from this regime.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is extracted from the throat when it falls upon that place.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to pincers, as you see: except that it has that curved part which goes into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And the end of it is similar to a bird's beak called a crook, in which there is an uneven edge: when it grasps something, it does not let go entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	§ On the opening of fistulas, and their division, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of fistulas, differing according to the manner of their occurrence, that is, one and only one in this book; they differ also in perforation and division from two directions.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of these, one is a type of ulcer that resides within itself and by virtue of what it comprehends from humours.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second manner is due to the places where it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Since the ulcer occurring in the head is different from that occurring in the anus; and the ulcer occurring in a fleshy place is different from that occurring in the joints; each of these has its own judgment based on its operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And there are ulcers that should not be perforated unless after the purification of the humours within them and their completion; and these are some of those that need to be perforated while they are raw and not purified according to completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As for ulcers that are close to joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Since when an ulcer occurs near a joint and persists until the putrefaction that surrounds it causes perhaps the corruption of the ligaments or nerves of that joint, then it is the cause of its closer contraction to that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an ulcer near the principal member; for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that or the principal member through it.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near a bowel; so do not perforate an immature ulcer that is close to a bowel unless it is left untouched until the putrefaction does not penetrate deep inside and extend into the interior of the anus, and thus becomes a fistula or remains in its terminal state where it does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You must know the hour of the perforation of the abscess, which has ripened according to its completion: and it is at the diminution of pain, the retreat of fever, and the lessening of redness, and pulsation, and the acuteness of the abscess head: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you must make the same perforation in a lower place of the abscess, and of greater eminence: and the perforation should be direct in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the joints, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and to the end in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that reflect, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to leave the perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there is much obstruction and hardness, and perhaps its edges harden, and its depth increases.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body where it is necessary, or according to that which the member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And you must administer to small abscesses a small perforation, and to large abscesses a large perforation: or many sections according to the similarity of their size.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are some incisions from which the skin must be carefully separated; and it is cut when it has already formed like a cloth, and has reached its limit, which is now dead: as happens with many, with swellings, and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And from these, some are cut using an incision having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And among these, there is one from which an incision is made resembling the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like the incision of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from these, some have a round incision, and others have a lunar incision; and there are similar incisions from which they originate.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	Indeed, where there is no head, like the soft and shallow incisions, it must be perforated with a single superficial perforation or merely flat.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when the incision is deep and has already absorbed a lot of blood, and you perforate it, you must not suck and drain all the pus at that time; on the contrary, extract some part from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then cover the incision until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	One should repeat this process many times according to the stage, until it is discharged; especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a very young child, or an old person who has declined: for indeed, the animal spirit often leaves the body with the emission of blood, and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, this chapter requires great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your puncture, through which you make these punctures (incisions), you must clean the wound; and consider (the following):
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If the wound of the small apothema (incision) is shallow or there is a flat section, then apply a lint or an old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if it is a large apothema (incision) with many cracks (from the puncture), then you should insert lint into every crack until they heal again.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin from the apothema (incision), or have chafed it in the surrounding area, then you should fill it with an old cloth, or as when a piece of fabric is sewn together, or rubbed with dry flax without moisture; and fasten it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove the bandage and take care of it as necessary with ointment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs during your hour of operation, then administer cold water and vinegar after it has been soaked up by a cloth, and place the same upon the place where the flow of blood is occurring many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If, however, the flow of blood persists, then you must administer treatment, care, and cleansers as described in many places in this book, and according to division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If, however, it is in the winter season and the affected area involves many nerves, then you must apply small pieces of cloth soaked in warm wine and oil, and place them over the area.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the summer season and the areas are fleshy, then you must place cloth soaked in water, oil, or wine and oil, all of which should be cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then you must open up the abscess, clean it, and administer to its care what is appropriate for it until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of treating abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the way of distinction, I have indeed spoken about every abscess, how it is the path to its cure, detailed individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the division of fistulas occurring on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	**Head XLI.**
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Fistulas of the head may occur, which are of a small size and resemble nodules contained within tunics that act as sacs; they seem to be swollen like the bowels of a chicken.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many varieties of these types.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	From them come fleshy ones: and from them are those that contain a moisture similar to pus; and from them are those that contain a moisture resembling phlegm and purules; and suchlike, and from them are those that become hard like stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the division of all [fistulas], there is no fear of their extraction as long as an artery does not oppose their section.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in the division of them is such that you should experience it with an instrument whose shape comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if there is that which contains moisture, then dry it by dividing it along the length of the section according to the superficial section; in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the incision from line B to line G. When the humidity is evacuated, then remove the skin that contains that humidity, and do not leave anything completely inside.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For often it repeats if anything remains from that humidity.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the bandage in Egyptian ointment if it is available; otherwise, use water and salt, and apply it to the wound, leaving it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	It (the ointment) indeed corrodes what remains from the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the application of the bandage with Egyptian ointment twice and three times, and if you need it, keep doing so until you trust that nothing remains from the cyst, then cure the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If it (the wound) contains a white nodule: then dry it according to this form, making an incision in the shape of a cross, and remove it from all sides, and try your strength in extracting the skin that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, an artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you next.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly, for an abscess if it is hard, perform the same incision and cure as I have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision over the apostema of the stone is easier because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain of these apostemata (apothemas) which are in the head of some men, in which there is no humidity at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	This is because I have followed the incision over the apostema (apothema) in the head of a woman who was pregnant, and I found the apostema to be like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: if anyone were to throw something at it, it would wound itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other cases of these apostemata (apothemas) occurring in the head, besides these apostemata which happen in the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial one.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation of them always from the lower part, so that the flow of blood (or pus) may drain to below.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then take care of them as is appropriate for their cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	**On the incision of strophula (staphyle, a type of skin growth) on the neck.**
Caput XLII.	Head 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These apoptesis often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin; sometimes they happen in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And regarding those that occur above them in the neck, there are both few and many; they originate from one another, and every strophule that arises from them is within their own tunics, as with the nodes and apoptesis of the head, as we have described.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these strophules.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And indeed, there are stones from them; and some contain humors; and others are malignant, which do not respond to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, regarding the good disposition you see from them by touch, whose manifest proximity to the skin's color is evident, and it moves towards every part, and it is not attached with the nerves of the neck, nor with ligaments, nor with an artery, and it is not deep: it is necessary that you cut it off with a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line, b. to the line, g., and peel it from every side, and extend two folds of skin with a hook, or with many hooks if needed, as we said in the apoptesis of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is on caution that one should not injure a vein or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And it should not be a blunt knife, for it will not help you with your cut and will disturb the patient, and you will cut what is unnecessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	However, if you cut a vein, an artery, or something that prevents you from operating, then make a small wound with a sharp knife or some powder that stops the bleeding, and bind the wound, but release it when the acute pain subsides and the wound becomes softer; otherwise, it will begin to putrefy and rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	Since blood is stopped by cutting, go back to your operation until it is completed.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then, use your index finger to check if there remains anything from the other small clots; if so, cut and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein in the root of the clot, then you should not cut that clot from its root; instead, you must tie it with a strong doubled thread and release it until it falls on its own without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then, cover the wound with a piece of old cloth that you have already dipped in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then, take care of yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the clot is entirely cut, then you should close the two edges of the wound and release them immediately after you see that there remains nothing superfluous.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that there remains an excess due to the size of the staphyle, then it is necessary that you direct yourself to cut and extract the root of it, and apply the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And if the staphyle contains moisture, pierce it with a superficial puncture to reveal its point of ripeness, and make the incision from that which follows below the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then apply a linen and ointment after the puncture to corrode what remains from the corruption, until you see that the wound is already clean; then care for it with a generation of flesh ointment until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	§ On the cutting of the epiglottis from an aperture inside the throat accident.
Caput XLIII.	Head 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said that this cutting in the epiglottis was not seen done by anyone on our land, and this is their written account of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in cases of synanche, the cutting of the epiglottis must be made with caution; when it does not cause a rupture through that part, because all veins and the lung are below.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot aperture in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no affliction in the channels, it is necessary to use the cutting of the epiglottis to escape from the destruction that occurs from the previous fever.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to cut the epiglottis into three or four sections with a small cut along its width, in that which is between two circles, so that the cut be on the side (not on the cartilage), this place belongs to the cut because it is enclosed by flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the physician is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should find the skin, until he reaches the canal: he must inspect the blood vessels if he sees anything from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the side we mentioned: and it is indicated above the canal section from the phlegm that comes out of it, with what it is broken apart, and the incision is made with forceps.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave an open wound at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	So when the time comes that he fears an advanced inflammation, he should bring together two lips of the wound's skin and leave its own alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then he should administer medicines that cause the flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this discourse that we have related is an exposition only when they see that one of these apostemes has already soaked the throat of the patient; and the patient, having overcome death, desires to be cut open so that he may breathe through the wound in some way, and thus be saved from death. And for this reason they hastened to leave the open wound until the evil of the illness is consumed, which takes three days, almost as if it were itself; then they hastened to close the wound themselves and care for themselves until they are healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I myself have seen is that a servant girl took a knife and sent it into her throat, and she cut with it part of the trachea.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called upon for her cure, and I found her groaning as if it were the groaning of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore examined the wound, and I found blood that had come out from the wound of the lung.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I am therefore convinced that she did not sever the vein, nor tie it off; and air was coming out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore attended to my own wound and cared for myself until it healed; and the servant girl suffered nothing but a hoarse voice, and after several days she returned with improved condition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say that there is no fear in the sectioning of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	**On the Sectioning of the Gut Hernia**
Caput XLIIII.	**Head XLIV**
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This hernia, called the gut hernia (hernia gutturis), is a large hiatus, according to the colour of the body, and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it occurs according to two modes: either it is natural or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural case, there is certainly no skill involved.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental case is according to two modes: one is similar to a thick knot.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to the hiatus that forms from the knotting of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear in it, and it is not necessary to make a supposition about it with the iron unless it is very small, and you should test it and explore it with the instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a thick knot and it is not suspended with any veins, then dry it as knots are cut, and extract it with what it contains from the cyst, if there is one; and if not, then carefully examine its whole extent.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with what is necessary from treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	§ On the division of nodules.
Caput XLV.	Head XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodules, and I have already described all their types in division; and it is necessary that I tell here the difference between a node and an excrescence, which causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that when the excrescence is characterized by heat, fever, and violent pains, until the efflux of excess fluid is checked and putrefaction completed; then indeed, fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When the node does not have heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains a cyst filled with its own sac, which has a color according to that of the body; and it is captured as a grape, and becomes like a bullet, and there are large and small ones.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a node, it is necessary that you experience it and examine it with the first instrument called an Intromissum, according to the shape it has in the chapter following this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the manner of examining the abscesses and all the nodules is that you take this instrument and insert it into a wetter place than the abscess: then gradually withdraw your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then place your last hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then extract the instrument and consider what comes out in the wake of its withdrawal.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore moisture comes out, whatever its colour is: then dry it with a superficial section, as I said regarding the other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not come out in the wake of the instrument's withdrawal, then know that it is fat: so dry it by having a section over it in the form of a cross, according to this form as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and strip the skin from all sides easily: and guard the cyst if you can above it, so that you may extract it whole with the nodule.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	However, if the cyst breaks apart during the operation and it is not possible to extract it whole, this often happens: then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if anything remains of it, whether little or much, the nodule will return according to the most part.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If the wound is shallow and remains open for a short time, then fill it with some sharp, corroding powder at its closure, tighten the wound, and place a hot compress on top of it, treating it as you would any other part of the body until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If it is a large knot, then treat its two edges and tend to what becomes flesh around it.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	However, if you have a vein that either pulses or does not pulse, then dig and fill the space with third-degree burn dressing, and leave it contracted for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the blood flow ceases; then return to cutting away what remains of the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	§ On external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Head 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From these are the forms of introjections, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	Indeed, there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	They should be made of iron so that the ends fit well into the wound aperture.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of experience and, indeed, perforation: one is called a bore, that is, a perforator, and there are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	From them there is the great, the medium, and the small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They converge so that they can be perforated and exit through them, and they form fistulas and buboes because of what is between them (the bones).
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others become round, smooth, flexible, like a large needle on which they are mounted, from citron, or brass, or iron, or steel, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And they (the instruments) are also made of black lead, which converge so that through them one can experience fistulas, the cavities of which reflect because of their softness, reflecting those images.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because they (the instruments) are long from some, medium from others, and short from others, according to the amount of the width and tightness of the fistula.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of the punctures, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Since they are simple, that is, having only one hard part, and there are three types as you can see, namely Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are the blind ones: and they are of three types.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them are those that have two hard parts and are of three types; and there are also those that have three hard parts and are of three types; and all these are necessary in their respective places.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels by which knots and ruptures are cut and incised; and they are of three types, since there is the large one, the medium one, and the small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	The ends by which they make the cut are sharp, while the other ends are not; and they are not used that way unless there is a need for them to assist in incising knots in the vicinity of veins or nerves; so as to heal the patient through them, and to gain some rest from the heat as it did during the excision of the apostema.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are magdas, and they are of three types.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of metal, and are similar to a radium, with which alcohol is produced; and on its end there is a hidden point of the spatem, through which it flows to the inside and outside when you look, as you can see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the spatums which are hidden between the fingers at the perforation of the aposteme: and they are not perceived by the assistants; and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of the winds through which the flow of blood is divided: and they are of three kinds, great, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They should be made from air or amber, round in shape, slightly longer than they are wide, as you can see, and to the right thickness.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And you must have these kinds of winds—the great and the small—with you, so that you can divide the blood with them swiftly when necessary, and then when you do not have any medicine at hand.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you should not use them to divide blood in every part of the body, and you should only use them in fleshy places, such as the legs, hips, arms, mammary glands, belly, groin, and similar places—from the fleshy, moist parts.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And at times, they are made into small instruments similar to the shape of nuts, by which blood is divided when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or near a vein or artery cut, and at times they are made round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	§ On the care of the mammary glands of men which resemble the mammary glands of women.
Caput XLVII.	Head XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell up at the time of sleep (that is, when they begin to have erotic dreams) until they resemble the breasts of women; and they remain so after awakening from sleep.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever dislikes this, should cut it off with a lunar incision, in this form from the line b to the line g. Then scrape off the entire puffy skin.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the wound with an ointment of dried medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitching, and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If the breast, however, descends lower and softens due to its own weight, as happens with women, then it should be found in both its upper sides by making two similar lunar incisions, of which each one is contained with the other at their ends, until a larger line contains the smaller, according to this form from the line b to the line g. Then scrape off the skin that lies between the two edges, and remove the puffiness, and apply what we said about stitching and poultices, which are necessary for healing, until it is cured.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not complete the incision that you should make because of the patient's restlessness or because of the flow of blood, then you should fill the wound with a submerged ointment that corrodes, and leave it, until it corrodes what remains of the puffiness.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the perforation of an apothema, which occurs under a titill (itch).
Caput XLVIII.	Head XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These apothemas that occur under the titill (itch) are of a hard kind, resembling strophulas, which contain cysts, and from them spring those that contain humors.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	What are those that come from the ones containing humors, they should be cut with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b to g. When all that is in the apothema is drained out through the sanie (purulent discharge), then fill it up with some clean cloth, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the cloth should be removed and the wound should be cared for with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the apothema is of the kind resembling nodules of strophulas, then cut it through, as we said regarding cutting into strophulas equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, the wound extends to this point that it emits pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what was said regarding that which has been mentioned above.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the division of a fistula that occurs due to an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery ruptures and the skin above it hardens, a fistula often forms there; the same occurs with veins, leading to a fistula and swelling.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that a fistula and swelling are due to an artery or vein are: for when a fistula is caused by an artery, it is long, deep in the body; and when you press the fistula with your fingers, you feel as if there were a hissing within it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round, prominent in the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the incision over this fistula is erroneous, especially when it is under the armpits, groin, neck, and many other places of the body; and it is very dangerous.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to take care of it with the knife, and what remains from them at the extremities, or on the head, should also be taken care of.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, over that which remains from them due to swelling at the opening of an artery, make a cut in the skin along its length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the wound with hooks, and afterwards the artery; then free it from the tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a needle beneath it and make it penetrate until it reaches the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread at two places, as I taught you regarding the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the space between the two ligaments with a spatule until all the blood therein has escaped and the hemorrhoid is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment that forms pus until the ligaments fall off; afterwards, care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess due to the incision of a vein, then you must hold it with your hand as best as possible from the abscess along with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a needle beneath the place that you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and put a double thread in it until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind it tightly with a good ligament; as I told you regarding the new ligament, from both parts with both ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you find that the thread is extracted, then insert another needle with a different thread beneath the whole abscess near the incision of the needle; press it and tie your threads at four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Next, cut a groove down the middle of the ulcer until the excess tissue is exposed. Then, incise the skin's surface and release what is bound to it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Next, place on it the small piece that you have dipped in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the treatment, which is done with lint and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	§ On the ulcer resulting from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Head (L.)
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an ulcer occurs in arteries and veins, so too does it occur in nerves; this happens due to compression or excessive strain, and similar conditions, and is particularly common in areas of support (such as the legs and feet) where there are many joints, and it can be quite severe.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It resembles the rest of the body in colour and is present in many configurations without pain; however, when it contracts with tension, the patient feels a weakness similar to fainting.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And the ulcer is not deep in the body, but rather lies under the skin; it moves to all parts and does not extend forward or backward, nor to the sides.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what arises from them at the joints should not be attacked with a blade.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Indeed, it may happen that contraction occurs.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	However, for what arises from them in the head or on the face, find the skin with a blade.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore there is a deviation of the joints, then hold it with pincers and cut it off at its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then hang it with a hook and scrape it; then remove it, and dress the wound with sutures, and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	**On the cutting of a deviation (in the abdomen)**
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some men suffer from numerous such growths (called "fungal" due to their resemblance to fungi) on their vessels and other parts of their bodies.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is thin, and whose head is large, and their lips are folded over.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And from them there is a few, and from them what is magnified greatly.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have already seen a man, and there were two testicles within his abdomen, which were more similar to other things like small roots; there was no difference between them, white or slightly red, and their lips turned inward, they split open, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore, cut them, and I found one weighing as one and eight ounces, and the other almost six ounces. And the operation in their incision is such that you should consider at that time, if the sick person is humid, and the color of the testicles is white, like a subtle root; then cut it with a wide scalpel, and there will be cauterization for you in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For indeed, much blood is often expelled during its section; therefore, if it catches you, cauterize it immediately.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see that it is weak and timid from the incision with iron, then take a thread made well of lead, and tie it with it; whose manner we have said, and release it in two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the tightness of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not therefore cease to tighten the lead, as long as it presses against the testicles, until it is completely severed and falls by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If, however, the swelling of the root is great, then there is something to be feared and afraid of in making an incision, especially when it is in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to make an incision through its middle.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it thoroughly so that it does not reopen.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not suppose that you should incise any swelling that has a dark colour, little sensation, and an unpleasant odour; for this is indeed the aposteme of cancer: and I will speak of the remembrance of cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	§ On the care of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Chapter II.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The care of the umbilicus should be given much attention for many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from cracks or openings above the abdomen; and it may come out through that opening, or through an intestine, according to what happens in other breaks.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood flowing from a vein, or an artery, according to what has been mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Due to its constriction, it is impeded there.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	However, if it is due to a crack in the skin and the opening becomes inflamed, then its colour resembles that of the body's flesh; it is soft, without pain, and appears in a different area.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its position is in accordance with what we have described, with a greater variety of differences.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it becomes hidden and then reappears, and perhaps there is a sound associated with this, and it appears very prominent at the entrance of the bath, causing great discomfort.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is indeed due to humidity, it is soft, then it will not be hidden when you press it with your hand, nor constricted, nor added to.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is due to blood, then with these signs, an ulcer appears blackening the skin.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	However, if it is due to new flesh: then the ulcer is grey, thick, hard, and takes on a shape according to its quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is indeed due to windiness, then its texture is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that case is to consider if there is an elevation of the navel due to the blood of an artery, or vein, or flow; then it is necessary to prevent from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that case there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke of apertures due to an artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the elevation of the navel is due to an intestine or gas, then it is necessary to urge the patient to retain his breath and stand stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark the signs with wax around the navel of the whole body.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then instruct him to turn over onto his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a wide spatula around the navel above the place that you marked with wax.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the opening of the aperture towards the upper parts with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie him around the strong circumference with thread or a strong silk string; and let the knot of the ligament be loosened.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the extended aperture above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you find that it is already freed from the ligature, then extract the bone, insert your finger into it, and push the intestine towards the inner part of the abdomen; and if you find the gallbladder, then take it with a hook and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, it is against you an artery or vein, then surround it greatly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then prepare for your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert two needles into the circle that you made around the wound in the form of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the wound at four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the flesh is putrefied and falls off by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and putrefies.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with what is necessary from ointments until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the prominence of the navel is from tough flesh in it or from moisture, then it is necessary to make the wound hollow, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then he treats it with what strengthens the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	**On the treatment of cancer.**
Caput LIII.	**Chapter LIII.**
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have discussed the division of the kinds of cancer and how to treat it with medicines; and caution is required when treating it with iron, so as not to ulcerate; and we have mentioned that cancer is generated in the matrix, and precautions to be taken from its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it; such as cancer that is in the breasts, or in the thigh, and similar places within the body, to be extracted from the entire body; especially when it is starting out small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it has truly been long established, and is large, it is not appropriate to approach it closely.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I have not been able to heal anyone from it; nor have I seen anyone else before me who has succeeded in treating it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when located as we have mentioned, is, as I have said before, to precede and relieve the patient from the black cholera several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then, if you notice a distinct fullness, it is a phlebotomy.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he is spoken to during the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then insert into the cancer hooks that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Next, make an incision deeply into it from every side with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and permit the blood to flow, do not cut it off quickly, but express the parts strongly, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or, if possible, with instruments there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	However, if the flow of thick blood from the artery or vein causes you trouble, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	**On the care of hydropsis.**
Caput LIIII.	Head (IV)
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have discussed in detail the division of the types of hydropsis and how water accumulation occurs; we will also describe the symptoms of each type and their treatment with medications.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those that are treated with iron are nothing but a mere appearance of medicine; and they do not approach the species of tympanitis with iron; nor do they fully adhere to the species of hypodermis, for it is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of hydrops as tympanitis with medicines, and your treatment has not improved it, then consider this:
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the weakness has already taken hold, or another illness besides hydrops is present, such as coughing or a relaxation of the intestines, and similar conditions, then be wary of treating it with iron, for that is a danger.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	However, if you see that the patient has abundant strength and no other illness besides hydrops alone, and is neither a child nor an old person, then the method of treatment is as follows: you should lift the standing patient into your hands, and have the assistant press his belly afterward by pushing water downwards with his hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a small, sharp spatula, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It has two sharp points at each end, elongated like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, it should be done with a slight curve so as not to penetrate too far during the operation until reaching the intestines, and to avoid damaging them.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	If there is a swelling due to fluid accumulation in part of the intestines, then it is necessary to extend with a cut from the navel, a quantity of three fingers, towards the lower parts in a straight line above the breastbone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If the swelling is indeed due to liver disease: then your cut should be left of the navel, with three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the swelling is due to the spleen, then the cut should be on the right side: and it is not necessary that a cut be made on the left side as well, so as not to cause excess fluid to flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the skin with an instrument throughout its entire thickness.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert your hand into that cut and with a spatula, lift the skin as if you were peeling it: and the amount to be peeled should be about the size of a fingernail, or somewhat less.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the membrane until the spatula reaches a void space: and this is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract the membrane, and insert an instrument into the opening, which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or brass, or copper, soft, smooth; it has a small opening at its lower part, and on its sides there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other; and its end is cut, according to the manner of cutting a quill, as you see: on its upper end there is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches water, then it descends immediately onto the instrument, so that at once the same amount of water is drawn up into the instrument.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you draw up more water from it than necessary, perhaps the patient dies from the resolution of his animal spirit; or he suffers a fainting spell that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Indeed, draw up water from it according to its strength, and according to what you understand from the disposition of the patient's pulse, and from the goodness of his condition.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it is retained immediately due to the skin that retains the opening which is above the siphon; of which I spoke, so that you pierce it according to that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the procedure with the instrument on the second day, if you see that the patient tolerates it; and also extract a small amount of water from it.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	During those days, perform that procedure without fear, and guard yourself against error; until there remains no water except a slight amount.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	However, if you have to deal with a weak patient who has released a large amount of water, then take care of them with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and under the sun, and they should be kept awake for thirst; and treat them with drying medicines until they are healed; and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after extracting the water, as I have described above.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Regarding the care of infants who are born in places where their urinary tracts are not pierced.
Caput LV.	Head (50th chapter)
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When an infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its head is not pierced, or the wound is tight, or it is not in the proper position.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, it is necessary to assist with the piercing immediately after birth using a delicate forceps, in this way.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a thin lead clamp in the opening and tie it; hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When the infant tries to pass urine, it should be moved and encouraged to void.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce the hernia.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the area will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose opening is narrow should be treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it becomes larger.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in which there is an opening in an improper place are damaged.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because the opening is near the end of the handle of the scalpel; therefore, it cannot be cleaned towards the front until he raises the scalpel with his hand to the upper parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	It is not born in the right way, because the sperm cannot reach the matrix straight; and it is a severe illness indeed.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the manner of operation is such that the patient should lie on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the scalpel's head with your left hand, stretching it greatly, and cut the head of the scalpel from its previous place with a sharp point or a fine chisel; just as you make an incision on a reed or radish, so that the opening falls in the middle as it should.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And be careful not to have bleeding during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, oppose it with what stops the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	§ On Albucasis regarding incidents in the prepuce and scalp, corruption, blackening, and adhesions.
Caput LVI.	Head (LVI)
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These Albucasis incidents often happen in the body, and there is corruption of the flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from those, some are malignant, and others are not.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, for the non-malignant ones, you should suspend them with a delicate hook and cut it off until they are all clean.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place on it a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat the whole area afterwards with dyed ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the ulcer is malignant and has a discoloured appearance, then after making an incision and removing the affected tissue, it is necessary to apply caustic to it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	However, if the ulcer is on a captive foreskin that is not circumcised, and it affects part of the foreskin inside and part outside, then you must remove the ulcer that is inside first, until it heals, before taking care of the outer part, because when you treat the ulcer at the same time as the foreskin, the foreskin will not be secured unless pierced.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And it also happens with the testes, where there is a darkening and rotting of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, it is necessary that you clean thoroughly everything that has already turned black and what wants to rot or has already rotted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply a line over it after that with honey mixed with flour of grain crushers and crushed herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it as with the rest of the cure until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	However, if there is bleeding, then apply caustic with a lunar cautery in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	The caustic indeed has two uses at the same time, namely to stop bleeding and heal a wound when it is rotting.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the weapon is corroded and destroyed completely in an instant, then it is necessary to insert a leaden cannula into the meatus first, so that the wounded person can urinate over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the true adherence of the prepuce to the head of the weapon, and this adherence does not occur unless in one whose prepuce is healthy, and no circumcision is required over it; and sometimes adherence happens due to a wound or ulcer: therefore, it is necessary to peel it away with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the weapon is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to discern these precisely, then it is necessary to peel away something from the head of the weapon and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because when the prepuce is thin, it may be easily perforated due to its own thinness quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate them with a thin linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water so they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with a styptic wine until it is healed.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	§ On the purification of infants and the cure from errors that befall them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a remedy for continuity, as with other wounds; nevertheless, when it is from our own operation, according to our will, and its use is proper for boys, it is necessary that we mark in this operation a better method, one leading more gently towards health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say, therefore, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books; for they do not use it in their laws, and it is only something we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	This is because I find a greater part of the work, and the use of scalpel-bearers and bloodletters, to be based on circumcision with a needle and with shears; they also use cauterized instruments and ligatures with wire, and incisions with nails.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tried all these methods, and I do not find a better method of cleansing with shears and binding with wire.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a needle, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore, perhaps the upper skin is incised and the lower layer is injured; hence it is forced to cut again to incise the other one, and future pain is incurred.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when the purification that is done through incision, that is, the digit (the one used by surgeons), does not secure the incision at the extremity of the male member, because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	However, in purification with the nail, perhaps the iron is bent and corrupts your operation, and the skin of a boy has a brief nature, and many are born like this so as not to require purification. And you will already have seen that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, purification with shears and tying with thread has revealed to me a good experiment: because the shears are of the size of the incision, therefore, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When therefore you apply your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate and they cut according to one operation at the same time, and a compression is made in a similar way, containing the skin of the sword from every side so that no error occurs at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the manner of operation is such that you can judge, especially a boy, if he understands a little what you do not do, except for tying the thread to his sword only and leaving it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him enjoy and be happy in every way possible for you from what he receives intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not sit down. Keep the hidden scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his armpit, and blow into the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the weapon emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean that which is collected on it from that filth.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then bind the lower part with a slight ligament according to need.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb, securing the lower ligament well, and cut between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then quickly lift the skin upwards and extract the weapon's head.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros.	Then allow the blood to flow slowly (it is better this way), and clean the wound from above; and place a cloth over it which has been soaked in the prepared rosewater and crushed with rose oil.
Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Lastly, apply it well and leave it until the next day, and take care of the rest of the wound until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the scalpel for purification is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	There are two ends to the knife, and they meet at an angle; let no branch of the claw extend beyond them; and the length of the two edges should be equal to the length of both handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	An error occurring during purification is that perhaps the entire inner skin or a part of it escapes from the cut.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you stretch it from the beginning with your finger before marking the place and cut it equally.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your finger, then extract it with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If, however, they exceed three days and there remains what is under the nail inflated and marked, then leave it until the mark becomes hot, scrape it off easily, and cut it according to what you have prepared, and be careful from the head of the nail.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not harm him, indeed.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Take care of it with what strengthens the wound from the dust that we mentioned in the treatise on dust, and if it is cut into the skin beyond the required depth and extends to the upper parts, it will not harm it even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it as we have said until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	**On the Extraction of a Retained Pin (or Splint)**
Caput LVIII.	**Head VIII**
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the urethra occurs due to a blockage caused by stone, congealed blood, pus, flesh growth, or similar conditions as mentioned earlier in the treatment methods for division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not relieved and you see its retention due to a stone that is located at the neck of the urethra, then he should be laid on his knees for treatment.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet should be placed on his back, and he extends his breath from the upper part of his back, and tightens his weak breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, it is effected by pressing the neck of the urethra towards the rear to expel the stone, which releases the urine.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not relieved as we have said and the condition of the patient is serious, then he should undergo extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: made of silver, thin, flexible, smooth like the stalk of a feather, about the length of one's palm from the middle knuckle. It should have a thin canal at its tip.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of removing a thorn is through itself to take a doubled thread and wrap it around the end with wool or cloth, a good ligature; and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syrinx; and cut away any surplus wool with shears, and insert it into the cannula with caution.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then, soak the syrinx in oil or butter and albut (a type of herb); and make the patient sit on a seat, and insert the vesica (urinary bladder) probe, and the urethra probe with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syrinx into the urethra easily until it reaches the root of the urethra.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double that part above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syrinx inside until it reaches the vesica (bladder), and the patient feels that it has reached the empty place; and this is not done in this order unless the passage through which it flows is one where there is curvature.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with the wool slowly.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The thorn will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it and let the thorn pass through the urethra; repeat the syrinx and do not stop doing this until the vesica is empty and the patient feels relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of enemas with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	**Chapter LIX**
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a ulcer occurs in the urethra, or blood is congealed within it, or pus becomes trapped therein, and water and medicines need to be introduced into it; then use an instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is indeed closed, that is, blocked.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And it has three openings; two from one side and one from the other, as you can see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave space where that which drives it is located, corresponds to the amount by which it expands itself without addition, until something is drawn out with it from the humidities; and when it is driven, with it is expelled far away; according to what the clepsydra does, through which naphtha is discharged, that is, Greek fire in martial contests.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When water is therefore discharged into the urethra, insert the end of the clepsydra into the humidity and draw it with that which drives it towards higher regions, for humidity is drawn into the concave space of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert the end of it into the syringe, as we mentioned.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then he drives out moisture with what drives it, for the moisture reaches the wound immediately, so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a delicate enema used for cleansing the wound.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or gold plating: the head should be higher like a small bowl, and beneath it there should be a cavity where the ligature falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the wound of an arrow, and place in it the moisture with which you cleanse the wound.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two cavities with a strong ligature of double thread, and warm the moisture above the fire for a little while.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the enema into the wound, afterward tighten your hand over the wound with a firm grasp holding the moisture, until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the wound.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If, however, you do not have the wound at hand, then take a fragment of parchment, and make from it a circle, and perforate it so that all its roundness is removed.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes as they open.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then, add a circular bandage, as you would a splint; after which, place what you wish from moistures, oils, and water within it.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then, tie the bandage tightly with an instrument; and make it as you did with the wet cloth from expression with your hand, until moisture reaches the wound.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	§ On the Extraction of Stones.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have discussed the division of stone types, their treatment with medicines, and the distinction between stones formed in the kidneys, bladders, and their signs; I also described the stone which requires manual operation and incision, and that one which is naturally expelled from the bladder; and I am recounting them here with clear exposition and abridgment.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore that stones formed in the bladder most often occur in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs, it is that urine exits the bladder similar to water in its fineness; and white sand appears in it, and the weak man rubs his penis, and struggles with it, and often hangs from it.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it protrudes, and the anus exits with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	Healing is easy for children, from the age they reach fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in young people it is medium, because it is between these two: and the treatment is easier for him whose condition is better; and if his condition is poor, the cure is more difficult.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the cure, it is therefore necessary, in the first place, to cleanse the patient with a clister, to extract all the filth that is in his intestines: for this itself sometimes prevents the stone from passing near the inquiry.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient is to be taken with his feet up, and shaken, and moved towards the lower parts: so that the stone may descend into the depths of the urethra, or sometimes jump out from its high position.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his hips, so that the urethra may be entirely inclined towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and feel him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the stone in the passage, then at once approach with a knife to cut over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall completely under your touch, then you should wipe the index finger with oil from your left hand if the patient is a young boy; or the middle finger if it is a fully grown youth. Insert it into their anus and use the stone until it rests under your finger, then gradually turn it towards the base of the urethra.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press it with your finger and push it towards the outside, towards the place where you made the cut; and tell the helper to press the urethra with his hand, and order another helper to stretch the testicles with his right hand upwards, and with his other hand to remove the skin that is under the testicles in the area of the cut.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the forceps, which have this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find where it is between the anus and testicles, not in the middle, towards the left side of the birth canal; and make the cut above the stone, and place your finger inside the anus; and make the cut transverse so that the outer part of the cut is wide and the inner part narrow, according to how much it is possible for the stone to come out from there without being too large.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger that is inside the anus near the stone, at the place of the cut, will press it and it will come out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that since the stone has angles and edges, this makes its exit difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it, it becomes soft, resembling a gland, and round, and thus facilitates its exit.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, those who have angles and margins, add them to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out in this way, then one must use skill over it; either tie a string over it with gentle movements, whose end is like the Moon, which ties over the stone and does not slip away from it; or introduce under it a fine instrument, carefully handled.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If, however, you cannot perform the above, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something catches hold of you with blood, cut it off along with the jagged edge.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If indeed the stone is more than one, then push the largest first towards the opening of the wound.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then incise over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push the smaller ones after it; and do likewise if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If the stone is very large, then it is done without knowledge, cutting over it with a great slice.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it happens to a sick person that one of two things occurs, either he dies or persistent urine discharge happens to him; for the place does not heal at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Indeed, the administration of expulsion should be done until it comes out; or use instruments in its fracture with shears, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with turpeth, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place over it a cloth dipped in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water, to soothe the hot fistula.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then lay the sick person back on his collarbone, and do not loosen the ligature until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosened it, then rub the place with much water and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with the ointment of dyafinic and basilicum until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If, however, there occurs in the fistula a hot, sore, and similar ulcer; as if the blood is congealed in the veins, and urine is forbidden from exiting from it; then that is known from the release of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore, insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood from it.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it causes the vein to corrupt and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then, clean the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; oppose every kind of thing to it that is suitable from treatment until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And during the entire course of treatment, it is necessary to bind both thighs and compress them because of the medicines placed on the site.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If a stone is small and sits in the urethra, and it is fixed in it, and blocks the passage of urine, then treat it with what I have mentioned before you reach the point of dissection.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Many times I have avoided dissection through this treatment, for I have already tested it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take a perforator of iron, whose form this is, with three pointed ends, sharp, fixed on wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie the stone to it under the skin so that it does not return to the urethra.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Next, insert the piercing iron into the wound with ease until it reaches the perforating stone, and then gradually turn the perforator with your hand on the same stone. Keep turning until you make the other side penetrate.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	It is immediately emptied (or drained).
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Next, press your hand over what remains of the stone from the outer part of the wound.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It breaks off and is expelled with the urine, healing the patient.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	However, if this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it from being done: then tie a thread under the stone and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Next, dry the stone on the wound between the two threads.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then, extract it (the stone).
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then, loosen the thread and clean the congealed blood in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to use a thread under the stone unless it prevents the stone from coming out; and another thread above the stone, unless when the lower thread is loosened after the stone's removal, the skin returns to its place and the wound is healed; and for that reason, you must tie the upper thread so that you pull the skin up, so that it returns to your completion point, and heal the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of women's stones.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone in women is not uncommon.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	However, if someone develops such a stone, then the cure is difficult, and it is prevented due to its many modes.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One reason is that a woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is that you will not find a woman who refuses medical treatment when she is chaste or has a husband.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third reason is that you will not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially in manual operations.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth reason is the distance from the location of the stone, which requires a deep incision, and there is fear involved.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	Which, if it becomes necessary, then you should take a woman who is well-versed in medicine, and she is hard to find.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If indeed you desire this, then seek a chaste, subtle physician and a present woman well-versed in obstetrics, especially one who has learned this art, make her present, and to her, perform all that you command her regarding the examination of the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, one must check if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary to insert a finger into her vagina and feel for a stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If she feels a stone, she should squeeze it with her finger and then immediately call the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina and feel for the stone; after that, she places her left hand over the opening and squeezes firmly.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If she feels the stone, then it is necessary to move it gradually from the opening of the vagina down towards the root of the coccyx with the utmost care.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should cut it at the level of the middle of the thigh near the root of the coccyx, from whichever side it is positioned, and feel for the stone; her finger should not move away from under the stone, which should be squeezed firmly, and the incision should be small initially.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she should insert the knife blade over that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If she feels the stone, then she should adjust the cut according to the amount that the stone emerges from her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that the types of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From it, there emerges a small and great, soft and hard, long and round branch.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore, know the nature of it, as this will indicate to you about that which you see above.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood binds you, then add to the place three layers of cloth and hold it for an hour until the blood stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then prepare for your operation until the stone is expelled, and do as you prepare with the instruments I mentioned for extracting stones from men, so that they may aid you in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If the flow of blood binds you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut, then place dust over the place, and tie it with small strings tightly: and do not loosen it, and let go of the stone, and do not extract it itself.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When the sharpness of the blood subsides after days and the place putrefies, then prepare for your operation until the stone is expelled.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On the incision above a water-filled hernia.
Caput LXII.	**Head of Chapter LXII**
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A water-filled hernia occurs only when there is an accumulation of moisture on the inner surface of the skin covering the testicle, which contains a sac; and it is called a sac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is confined within its own bag, which nature has prepared for it in a certain part, until it can be expressed; which is another sac, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sac we spoke of; and this occurs rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	The cause of this formation of these branches is the weakness that occurs in the testicles, which is why this material flows to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And it also happens due to impact or striking above the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or it may have a decline to yellowish-green, or it is red-blooded, foul-smelling, black, or water-white; and that is the worst.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the accumulation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if there is any change in the wound as we have said, then the fistula is round and of a length somewhat like that of the figure: and the testicle does not appear since it is contained by humidity from every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is humidity in the flesh itself, then the fistula is round with a certain part of it, and because of this, a person thinks that it is another testicle.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if there is humidity between the skin of the testicles and the white wound, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you observe the colour of humidity, then examine the colour of humidity in the fistula with a square intruded, whose form precedes.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, according to what comes out in the sign of the intrusion, judge of that which is between them.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you urge the patient, if possible for him, to have blood drawn, and see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should be laid on his back over a high place slightly, and under it many cloths should be placed.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left side, and bid the helper to sit by his right side, who shall stretch his patient's leg to one of the two sides of the skin of his testicles, and to the part of his heart.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad blade and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length down to near the chest. And let the incision be made according to the straight line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white part that encloses them: then peel and observe, or carefully cut away this part, so as to peel it yourself. Let your incision be where your peeling begins, from the part that hangs down with the egg more than others. And examine the peeling minutely according to what is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then make a wide perforation through the white part filled with water, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the section with hooks, and extend the white part upwards, without touching the skin enclosing the testicles: and cut into the white part as is possible for you to cut it yourself, either in its entirety or in pieces, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine the incision, there will be no security in it, but water will remain.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the egg proceeds from its skin during your surgical hour: then when you have completed the incision of the white part, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it like the rest of the wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a wound corrupted from blackness by another, then it is necessary to use ligation tools, which are the suspenders, in order to prevent the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut the testicle with its suspender and extract the wound; afterward, take care of it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water is aggregated in two parts, then know that they are two branches; therefore, dry the other part equally as you did with the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it agrees with you, so that it becomes one operation, then do it; afterward, wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the sections a thread soaked in oil or rose oil; and place from outside another thread than you soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and open the abdomen; and place double cloths on top of them, which are small; and bind them above with a ligature, which has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, and soak them, and fill them with dye according to this likeness; and make the ends by which it is pressed from cotton or wet wool; and join them with a tight band around the waist; and one end should be taken over the anus up to the back, and the second should be taken towards the chest area; and two other ends are taken over the lower thighs, and the other two ends are taken over the inguinal regions, and the whole tightness is joined around the waist.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes, this ram is medicated artificially with a cauterizing iron at the site of section: and it is as if you take a delicate scalpel and cut the skin with it along the testicles; and it is ignited, as we have mentioned, until it reveals a white surface containing water. Then take the cauterizing instrument in this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It is assimilated to Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then perforate that white substance with it, and ignite it until all moisture is expelled.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the white substance with hooks and scrape it away with a delicate, ignited cauterizing instrument, cutting it as much as possible until you completely remove it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And cauterize from there, so that it does not touch the original fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is more salutary and prolongs blood flow less, and is better than an operation with section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If indeed it causes you contraryness during the time of section or during the time of cauterization, or a warmth, or blood flow, or something else: then you should care for what contrariety it causes from that with the cure it is accustomed to, as mentioned above.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect this surgery because of his fear, then administer the puncture as I describe that it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you have certified to yourself through what we said about the signs, that the patient has a water-like pulse: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then puncture the fistula in the lower part of his body with a wide-bladed instrument: and place the puncture along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place over the wound a clean dressing, tie it tightly, and let it flow until all the remaining water has drained out: then care for it until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is opposition to the flow of water during the time when you puncture it, and this is not due to a white skin flap obstructing the wound opening and preventing the water from flowing out; then you must insert a needle into the wound or an instrument with which the hydropic water is extracted, whose form has previously been described: or add a little to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns and accumulates after six months, or about those times.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it accumulates again, then it will be healed in the same way, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the treatment of flesh wounds.
Caput LXIII.	**Head XIII.**
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in this section about the ramicum (flesh wound), there are many dispositions to fear, leading to harm.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal is salutary from that (condition).
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am reminding here of the operation (involved) and the appearance (of the wound).
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, therefore, that there are many apostematas (flesh wounds) in bodies, from which the testicles are composed; and this (wound) arises from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from the overflow of an acute (or sharp) wound, which flows down to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from (the effect of) pounding (or striking).
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the apostema (flesh wound) is according to the color of the body, and it does not cause pain; and this (wound) is a gray apostema.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone-like (flesh wound), whose color is dark brown, and there is no sensation (of pain).
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it arises from the constriction of arteries and their swelling, as has been mentioned before; or from the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	What is therefore due to the swelling of arteries is known by the appearance of the apoplex when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary for you to touch it directly at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	What is done due to the swelling of veins does not disperse anything from it when pressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is now possible that an incision can be made over this type of condition and over the other parts of the body; and it is like cutting the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the flap upwards and extract it with a clean knife; and free the suspensory from its origins, and tie the vessels; and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from all parts of the surrounding tissue.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the flap has become consolidated with those born tissues, then you must grasp the flap and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between something of the flap or in what is between the vessels, then you must free all that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If, however, there is a birthmark of the flesh in a place where adhesion occurs, which is at the rear, then it is necessary to cut out the whole of it and remove the adhesion, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Having thus completed your operation, then fill the wound with the ointment prepared from rose oil and wine; thereafter care for it as you do the rest of the healing process until it is cured.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	**On the Care of Ramics (which is with Vine)**
Caput LXIIII.	**Head 149.**
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It is a condition known as apoplexy, when there is an inflammation similar to a botch that affects the testicles, making it difficult for the patient to move, exercise, or walk.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	In the treatment of this illness, fear plays a part due to the remembrance of what preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	Indeed, we must say that the operation on it is as they (the first ones) did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, therefore, that you must make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then, push the suspender of the testicles down.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, close to the scrotum, and have another assistant pull it gently but firmly.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a sharp, straight blade across the vessels until they are detected.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape it from all sides, as we told you during the extraction of the arteries in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix them with a sharp point where the double thread is located, and tie it off at the first places where the arteries occur; then tie it off again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut it in the middle with a straight section along the length of the body, and extract what is aggregated from putrid, foul humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the wound with the same treatment as the other wounds, where pus is generated, so that the vessels nourishing one testicle will fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not, after all, a bad thing.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If, however, all the vessels happen to be affected, then they must be extracted for this reason, so that the testicle is not deprived of nourishment because of the incision, and it does not become gangrenous or wither, and there is no lingering pain with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the care of the intestinal ramus.
Caput LXV.	Head XV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The course of this ramus is from an incision which takes place in the perineum over the vessel in the inguinal region near the abdominal wall.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from a simple cut or from the extension of that cut.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis.	And these two types occur from many causes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from impact.
Aut saltu.	Or through a spasm.
Aut clamore.	Or from noise.
Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	Or from the elevation of a grave condition, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign when it is from the extension of a cut.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly; and it is a deep gap opposite to the cut, because the cut compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from a clean cut, because it causes a sudden severe pain from the beginning: and it is a diverse opening, visible under the skin nearby: and that is due to the exit of the intestine, and its course towards the external sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it comes out with the intestine twisted, and this is called the intestinal twist, or twisting of the intestine, and sometimes it occurs with a twist.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And when feces runs into the intestine and gets stuck there, it brings about great danger for a weak person, since it causes severe pain, especially when pressed upon.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this disease, there is fear with regard to wounds, therefore one must be careful about cases involving it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is to urge the patient, so that he reduces his intestine by hand to its own inner cavity, if he obeys it returns.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he is placed back over his collarbone between your hands, and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin towards the upper parts, and dry the skin of the testes along its entire length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix in two jaws of the cutting instrument hooks, according as you need to open the cut with them; and the cut is made according to the amount that it is possible for him to come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the skin from the channel and what is under the skin of the testicle, until it detects white, hard from every side; then insert your index finger into what follows the testicle, where it is between the white channel below the skin, and between the second channel, and completely with it adheres to the posterior part.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with the right hand towards the inner skin of the testicles: and as this extends the white channel upwards with the left hand, encourage it to move with the channel; and then, carefully, pull back the channel to loosen the adhesion at the rear, completely.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And ask your fingers to ensure there is nothing left intact from the intestine inside the white, hard channel.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	However, if you find anything left from it inside, then push it towards the center below.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take some wax, in which there is a thick thread made from ten threads, and insert it at the rear of the channel, that is, the tunic, which follows the cut under the skin of the testicle; then cut the ends protruding from the thread until four threads remain.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over others in the form of a cross and bind them with the channel we mentioned, which is under the skin of the testicle; do this until no part of the vascular tissue can be seen to come out of them; so that there will be no risk of infection from heat.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And again, place the second ligament according to the first, distant from it by less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments, separate them from each other using a knife, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, in the amount of the length of a finger; and cut through the rest entirely according to its roundness, and remove the ovum from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then, cut through the lower part of the skin of the testicles where the blood flows from, and drain it as we described in what has been said above.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply a strip of linen soaked in oil to the wound, and place it over the cut; and apply the ligament as we described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the white skin we mentioned has been cauterized after the cut, be careful of the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Indeed, this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligament until it falls off on its own.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, the case delays, then it is moistened with hot water; and place over it what we mentioned, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then take care of the wound with the rest of the treatment for the injury, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	About the Rapidly Flowing Stream (referring to blood flow)
Caput LXVI.	**Head XVI.**
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this book, I have not seen anyone who has dared to perform surgery with a sword.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And indeed, they said that it is done as we have narrated in the book which is called "The Canon" with respect to the heart.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is to tie the threads after making a cut over it with ease below; then dry it in the middle, and treat it afterward with what opens it, until the threads fall off; and treat the wound, as we said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	§ On the disruption that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Head XVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the opening protrudes and does not extend down to the testicles involving any internal organs; and if it does extend, it is but slight and returns to normal within a few hours. However, if it prolongs with that condition for some time, an additional fissure develops in the scrotum until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this occurs because of the extension of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because the scrotum extends: then it softens, and the opening shifts, and it protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as was described previously.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron, in this way: and the patient lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture and the prominent part, cutting across the width, according to the length of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the strings to the parts beneath the skin until it shows a clear white, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the knife and place it over the prominent part from the white, and press it deeply into the entrails.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then prepare two prominent parts on the ends of the knife from the white, and attach one to the other with a stitch; then remove the end of the knife.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the white at all, nor stretch any other part, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with the care of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the thread, clean it, and heal the wound until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	The suture is contracted, and no eminence of rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	§ On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Head LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in certain men, because the flesh surrounding them becomes soft, and the appearance of it is disfigured.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore, he who is asked for his treatment should make the sick man lie down on his back, and cut away all the softened skin that has become detached from the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he should close the two lips with a suture: and if there is any surplus of the softened skin, he should make three or four sutures to secure it.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then he should cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then take care of the healing of the remaining wounds, until they are healed, and the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	**On Castration**
Caput LXIX.	**Head LXIX.**
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	**Know that castration is excommunicated by our law; and for that reason, I shall not mention it in this book of mine, and its remembrance is not necessary except for two reasons.**
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	**One of these is that a doctor should be familiar with it when asked about it, and know the treatment for those who have suffered from it.**
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	**And another reason is that we often need castration for certain animals due to our needs by it, such as sheep, pigs, cats, and similar animals.**
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	**I say, therefore, that castration is performed according to two methods.**
Aut per attritionem.	**Or by friction.**
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	**Or by making an incision and opening.**
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	**In the case of those done by friction, the method of operation is as follows: we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften, relax, and hang down; then, with your hand, press them until they separate and no longer appear under the skin.**
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration through incision and separation, you must hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensories and cut across every section of the wound until two eggs pass through; then incise them after you have scraped both, and do not leave anything on them from the cauterizing except a subtle scar over the vesicles.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by traction, because the traction may leave something from the testicles, which is why the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	§ On the care of hermaphrodites, two methods.
Caput LXX.	Head 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	The hermaphrodite is from men according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears to have a space following it, or on the skin of the testicles, where it is between the two testicles, resembling the figure of a woman's vulva, and sometimes urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	However, in women there is one characteristic, and the female organ above the breast resembles the small male testicles, projecting outward; of which one is like the male's penis, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three types, two from males and one from females, is as follows: because it is necessary to cut through the added flesh until the impression of them escapes.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then, the care of these wounds is with the treatment of the rest of the injuries.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	However, in the second type of males, from which urine passes, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure for it at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	§ On the cutting of the clitoris and the protruding flesh in the women's vulvas.
Caput LXXI.	Head LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The clitoris may be enlarged beyond its natural size, until it becomes disfigured, and when it is magnified in certain women to such an extent that it reaches the size of a man's, and even reaches the point of coitus.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, it is necessary to hold the excess of the clitoris with the hand or a hook, and cut it; and not too deep into the cut, especially at the root, so as not to cause bleeding.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself with treatment, until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, in the middle stage, there is a part that is born from the mother's orifice and does not fill itself until it reaches its proper size; and perhaps it will emerge outwardly in a shape similar to a tail. And for this reason, some people call this illness "tail-borne disease".
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, we must treat it as we do the tentacle, and care for it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	§ Regarding the care of the Alratic, which is a woman's vulva not pierced.
Caput LXXII.	Head LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The Alratic is such that it is the woman's vulva not pierced, or has a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from a disease that precedes it; and itself becomes either from the flesh that has grown there, or from a subtle discharge, or a thick one; and it appears either in the depths of the matrix, or on its sides, or at the top of itself, or at the bottom; and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of it is gained through examination of the obstetrics, if the opacity is apparent and close.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	However, if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	However, if the opacity is from a very thin membrane and is close to both lips, then approach it and break it open.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, as you place two small pieces of cloth over the lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your two hands together and have the woman lie on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the lips firmly until the thin membrane breaks and the opacity opens.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a cloth, soak it in oil, and place it on the area; have the woman press it daily so that the wound does not harden again.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	However, if the membrane is thick and hard: then it is necessary to cut it with a sharp, similar broad leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	However, if the opacity is from flesh grown over, then suspend it with hooks and cut it; and use medicines that stop the flow of blood without bruising, such as Acacia and Dragon's Blood, mixed with alum and wax.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Next, insert a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal quickly, and hold it for several days. Then apply linseed oil, after which it should be treated with the remaining remedies until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when a birth occurs within the womb of living flesh, it must be done in this manner: as long as there is no sign of cancerous decay, for the cancer that is within the matrix should not conflict with the use of iron entirely.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	§ On the care of hemorrhoids, Athhelil, and the red botch on women's bodies.
Caput LXXIII.	Head LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the veins' outlets, as long as much blood flows out from them persistently.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids become severe, they turn into botches (thehil), and I have already spoken about their types and signs. Here, I will say which ones receive treatment and which ones do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say, therefore, that hemorrhoids which are within the matrix's opening and do not appear to the senses: then there is no cure with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those which are from them within the matrix's opening, on which the senses fall, are those that are treatable.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the edges with scissors or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then clean them near the flow of blood from one of the cuts without causing an infection, such as oak sap, dragon's blood, pitch, and similar substances.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push her feet against the wall at that moment.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	After that, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, and rhubarb bark, and gallstones, and similar substances.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If blood comes out with it, that is good; and if not, make the back and breasts adhere without scarring.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take a thread, dip it in tarash (a dye), or in sea snail extract, or in the sap of winged elm bark, that is, in alum, wine, and make it adhere to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the abscess has healed, then treat the wound with ointments until it is cured.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	The true red (fever) is similar to the heads of garlic, and it has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut what appears from it, according to what I said in those parts equally, and treat (the wound) itself until it is cured.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	§ On the perforation of the uterine neck that occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Head LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many types of abscesses occur in the matrix, such as cancer, stone-like abscesses, ulcers, festers, and erysipelas, fistulas, hemorrhoids, cracks, and pustules, and hot abscesses.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed already spoken about all these ailments and their kinds, and the signs of each, and their treatments in division: it is necessary that I should speak in this treatise about the hot abscess that occurs in the matrix, when it is from abscesses that gather blood, and we must know how its opening is made with a blade.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary that you should consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the apoplexy is acute at its onset with its blow, and with flame and fever, and you see it turn red, and if the sense falls upon it, then you will not rise with the perforation of that wound, and treat it with what is beneficial beyond its over-ripening, until such time as the acuteness of the accidents ceases.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then you must make the woman sit on a seat that supports two cushions, and recline or lie down on her back, and bring her feet up to the lower part of her belly; and let her hips be spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, and bind them with both corresponding bands.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the woman's right side, and use an instrument to open the orifice of the mother's womb.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Which is the form that comes into those that are afterwards.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And when you see to administer this instrument, you must insert it into the deep part of the woman's womb, so that what enters from the instrument is not deeper than the womb itself and does not harm the patient.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If, however, the instrument is deeper than necessary, then you must place small pieces of material over the cover of the deep part of the womb, to prevent the instrument from entering entirely into the womb itself, and you must ensure that the spring which runs in the instrument extends from its upper side, and hold the instrument steady until the deep part of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When the opening appears and is touched by hand, and it is soft and supple, then it should be cut off near its own head with a wide scalpel.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the wound is thus cleansed, then it is necessary to apply a thin layer of oil of rose or oil of myrrh, which has some astringent quality, and place the poultice, then extract the section deeply into the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place on the outside over the matrix, and over the comb, a clean woolen cloth soaked in water with badles (bulliae).
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it is treated after two days with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix and the wound are cleansed so that it is washed with water and honey, then afterwards with water in which a root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled, and finally return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary to prevent treatment with iron, but rather take care of it as we said regarding division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	**On Obstetrics: How embryos outside the mother's body should be treated, according to their non-natural form of exit.**
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXX: Head
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to understand the natural form of childbirth first.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From these signs, therefore, if you see a woman pressing down below and desiring to smell the air and feel relief above her from childbirth, and she hastens the exit of the child, then know that this childbirth is according to the natural form, and the second stage follows with it: either suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary to press her belly so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over her head, the second stage follows with it, and they are cleansed of their excesses with good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	However, any childbirth outside of this one is unnatural, reprehensible.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the foetus emerges on its feet, and its body before its head and feet and one hand or foot, or its head and hand, or turns around over its collarbone, and such like from unpardonable forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, the midwife must be prudent and subtle in all these matters, and guard herself from error and deception, and I am showing every figure from them, and how the skill is in it, and it is indicated by that, and stands over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus comes out from above its head in a natural delivery, and it becomes burdensome for the woman, making childbirth difficult, and you see that its strength is already weakened, then make her sit on a seat or have women support her. And apply vapor to her womb with fennel seed cooked in moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert her finger between her lips and find the second [spasm], and cut it with her nail until the fluid runs clear from it; and she should press on the woman's womb until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If, however, the fetus does not descend, then the woman should be given a enema with fennel mucilage mixed with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then after the enema, tell her to press herself, and make her sneeze with the mixture, holding her nose and mouth at the same time.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If both hands of the fetus come out first, then you should gently pull them back one at a time.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If, however, she does not obey during the introduction, then place her on a seat and raise her feet up; then quickly tilt the seat over the ground, and have someone hold her to prevent her from falling during the tilt.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not emerge and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remaining parts of the fetus, and tie its hand with cloth, and extract it carefully, for it will emerge.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The outcome of the fetus on its own feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges on its own feet, it should be gently pushed upwards; then gradually turn the fetus; afterwards, leave it alone.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and gradually stretch it out.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they emerge up to the thighs, then strongly press them and make it sneeze with a condition; for it will emerge if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not emerge as we have described, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place it according to its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will emerge then with easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is prevented from emerging as we have described: then take some mucus of the womb, and oil of the navel, and dissolve the gum; and strike all of it well in a mortar; then line with it the vulva of a woman, and below its entrails.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she achieves relaxation.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	So, when you see that her lower parts have been warmed, then make a poultice of myrrh and apply it to her.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she can hold the poultice for an hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneez, hold her mouth and nose closed, and gently press on the lower part of her belly.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	The foulness will leave immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The fetus emerges on the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it exits in this manner, then slowly insert your hands while delivering.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie back on her collarbone, hanging her feet down below, and she herself should rest on the bed, covering herself with her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then gently press above her belly gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under her feet from the particles, until she is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then take its feet and move them with a gentle motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press gently what is above the hypogastric region slowly until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then he should insert his hand and gently extract the fetus slowly, and especially instruct the woman to press until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus, hanging laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Use your hand for its reduction.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If, however, it cannot be reduced, then support the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she cannot walk, then make her lie down on the bed and gently strike her legs with a rhythmic motion.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the liniment prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she feels the pains of labor, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then focus on reducing the hands and aligning the fetus according to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and instruct her to press herself until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus is over its own neck, with its hands expanded, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary for the midwife to hold the fetus' hand, then gradually unravel it, and align it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is aligned, then place over its head what we described as oil and mucilage.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct it to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	After having done that, then have it sit on the seat and instruct it to lean towards its right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct it to compress itself, and have it sneeze when ready.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the fetus is prepared on its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the mother's opening in this manner with the plug, then cut the plug with your finger, until it is emptied of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it hangs over the fetus' face and neck, then make an incision from its navel, so that it does not get trapped and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus towards the inside until you place it as it should be, and instruct the woman to compress herself several times; for thus it will emerge through the vaginal opening.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	On the emergence of twins or multiple fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that of having three or four is rare and unusual.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Indeed, it is a matter outside of nature, and they do not live completely; and they contain themselves, even when they multiply, in a single sac; and they separate through a natural opening, distinguishing each one from the other, joined at the navel to their common umbilical cord.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they emerge as one fetus does through a natural opening easily; and they emerge through a terrible opening, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult during childbirth and reach that which we have said from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have narrated: and let it be a narrow obstruction, and do what it does with ease or slowness, and stretch according to every figure as it is prepared for it by the skill leading towards salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder that it is formed within a matrix from embryos and some abort.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, or even more than ten are formed in the matrix, and as I write this, it has come to my knowledge that a woman, during abortion, gave birth to seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which is done according to the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, all of this must be known by the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps she may find something similar to it; therefore, she should oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus that does not come out after division from the medication and you need to extract it with your hand, then you must consider:
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If the woman is of healthy constitution and is not suffering from any of the conditions which one fears might lead to her loss, then she should be laid on her back with her head lower than her feet, and her legs raised; and let someone support her from both sides or bind her to the bed so that her body does not slip out during the extraction.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then he moistens the mother's wound with wet oils mixed with mucilage, fennel, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then she greases her hand with these oils and mucilages, and then introduces it into the mother with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then he seeks with it the place where the hooks of the fetus enter, and suitable places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore, at that time, if the fetus is prepared to descend over its own head: then he fixes the hooks in its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its beard, or in its furca, or near its ribs, and under its ribcage.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If, however, the descent is over its feet, then in its pelvis, and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that he holds the hook with his right hand: and places his fingers of his left hand within it: and introduces it with ease, and fixes the hook in one of those places we mentioned, until he reaches the natural opening.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he fixes another hook in its opposite, or a third one if needed: so that the contraction is equal, and it does not decline to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended equally, and not only in a straight line, but moved to every part so that its outlet is relieved, as is done with a tooth during extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary that there be softening of the extension in what lies between.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part is retained from that, then it is necessary that the midwife apply some fingers lubricated with oil and insert them from the side to break free what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	So if the fetus part emerges, then the hooks are changed to another place that is higher: do this until the whole fetus has emerged.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand comes out before others and it is not possible to reduce it because of its contraction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until the whole thing comes out, cut it or incise it at the joint of the plant (finger) or at the wrist: and thus you should do with the other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the fetus' head is large, or there is a contraction when it comes out, or water has accumulated on its head, then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a sharp-pointed instrument called a Spatumile and hold with it the head, and extract the water; or break it itself with an instrument called Almisdac, whose shape corresponds to that of the other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the foetus has a large head by nature, then it is necessary to cut open the mother's abdomen and extract the child with misdelivery, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then, take hold of the bones with pincers.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head gets out and is stuck at the level of the fork, then it is necessary to keep trying until the moisture that is inside the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	However, if it does not complicate or obstruct the exit, then cut the head as much as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower abdomen is infected or there is hydrops inside it, then you have to pierce it until the moisture runs out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If indeed the foetus is above its feet, then its attraction is easy and its direction towards the mother's mouth is lighter.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	However, if it gets stuck at the level of the abdomen or chest, then you have to extract it with the cloth that you wrapped over your hand, and open the abdomen or chest until the moisture inside runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If the remaining limbs are removed and the head is brought back, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the opening of the matrix is wide, then he should insert his hand into its depths and feel for the head with it, and draw it towards him with his fingers until it reaches the matrix's mouth; then he should insert one hook or two hooks in there and draw it towards him.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the matrix's mouth is constricted due to the heat that has befallen it, then one should not strive over it, but rather administer emissions of moist substances, fat-based ones; and apply plasters; and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is positioned on its side, then it may be able to reposition; then one should administer what we have said regarding a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then it should be cut open fragmentarily, and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything from the second layer inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said regarding the hot apoplemas that occur in matrices.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If there is a blood flow, then it should descend into stipulative waters, and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed I have seen a woman whose womb was dead within; then she became pregnant again on top of that, after which the other fetus died too.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	After a long time, an abscess formed in her navel, which became inflated until it opened, and then it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called upon to treat her, and I medicated her for a long time; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I then placed some strong plasters over it; and an opening appeared in the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed, and another opening appeared.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore amazed to see that there was no opening in the abdomen.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I therefore thought that it was because of the bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I then examined the wound, and removed many bones, while helping the woman to be in better conditions; and it had not been thus for a long time, and it began to discharge pus from the place little by little.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not stop here with this foreign matter, except because there is knowledge and aid to it, which the skilled physician administers by hand from treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the shapes of the instruments necessary for the extraction of the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the shape of the forceps, whereby the books are brought together, having two notches at each end of the two wooden arms.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this notch should be made more delicate with a forceps, and it can be done from either ebony or wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each piece of wood should be like two fingers; and the edge of each is like one finger, and their length is a palm and its middle part; and in the middle of both pieces of wood are two additional parts of the same kind of wood, already fixed on both sides, whose length is the middle part of a palm and a little more or less: and the width of each is like two fingers, or a little more or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additional parts are inserted into the mother's womb so that it opens with them when you remove both notches.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The shape of the forceps when it opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another shape similar to it but more delicate and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Make it from ebony wood or bushy, according to the shape of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it, there are two additional parts, as you can see above; and the length of each addition is about the palm, and the width of each is the span of two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you wish to open the wound with it, then make the woman sit on the bed, her feet hanging down, and open what is between her legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two joined additions into the wound, and you hold the end of the instrument below between her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you would with scissors, equally according to the amount that you wish to open from the mouth of the wound, until the midwife does what she wishes.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The shape of the other vertigo as mentioned by the ancients, the shape that impels the fetus, what it is impelled by.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The shape of the almisdad, through which the large head is held; it resembles a forceps, with teeth at the end, as you can see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it becomes oblong, according to this shape, as you can see, with teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it cuts and holds.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The shape of the almucant (a surgical instrument) which is used to compress the head of a parous woman (a woman who has given birth).
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The shape of the instrument used to hold one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The shape of the instrument used to hold two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The shape of the forceps with sawtooth edges, which is used to compress the head of a fetus.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The shape of the instrument with two ends, used to sever the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The shape of the two wide scalpels (spatumilia).
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used, and the more varieties there are and the better they are prepared by the craftsman, the faster they can perform their function and the higher their value among people due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not despise any of these instruments, but ensure that you have prepared them for use.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	The need for these instruments is indeed inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	## On the Extraction of the Secondine (a surgical term)
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second stage of labor is prolonged, it is necessary to support the exhausted mother so that she can retain her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze when she is in a calmer state: and place your hand over her mouth, and her nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it emerges through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If this does not work: then take a pot and perforate a small hole in its lid; place inside some herbs that open the mother's womb, such as calament, rhubarb, aneth, chamomile, fennel, and centaury; or any of these herbs alone, and immerse them in water, then place them on the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a hot compress made of birch bark over the opening of the pot, and its other end against the mother's womb; and hold it until steam reaches the depth of the mother's womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The second stage will then pass with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If, however, after this cure, it does not withdraw, then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sycamore oil or alum water.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he should insert into the vagina and feel for any signs of the second stage.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When he has found it, then he should take hold of it and gradually stretch it out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If, however, it is attached deep within the mother's womb, then he should insert his hand as we have described, until he finds the second stage, and extract it gradually according to its right position, so that the womb does not fall during the strong traction; indeed, it must be turned with ease to the right and left; then add to the amount of traction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It then obeys and tightens, and is released from adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	Which if the womb's bone is constrained, as we have already mentioned: treat it with sneezes and from the poultice of herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If, however, it does not withdraw with all that we have mentioned, then be careful not to tire yourself out in repeating the process of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Indeed, it is necessary that what comes out from the womb to the woman's hip be bound.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	He then cleanses it with a four-ingredient ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	Indeed, it will putrefy and dissolve after a day, and then it will come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it putrefies, a bad smell is released from it that affects the stomach and head, and it harms the patient.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, it is necessary for them to administer appropriate fumigations to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancient ones were already experienced with the fumigations of nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of the instrument used for fumigation for women during childbirth and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from a similar kind of pipe as the alcama or from clay: and place its broad end over the fire; put the fumigation on top of the prunes; hold it until that fumigation is consumed, then take another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	§ On the healing of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born with their anus unperforated, which has already been successfully treated by a skilled surgeon.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife must pierce it with her finger if it is not already pierced; and if that does not work, pierce it with a sharp spatula, but be careful not to touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it a cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If, however, it does not heal, then insert a lead pipe into the wound for several days and remove it when the child wants to pass stool.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And it has already happened that the anus is pierced during the healing of the wound or the fistula.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut that consolidation, then treat it with what we said from healing and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	**On the healing of fistulas occurring in the lower part.**
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX (80)
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are a matter of inflammation and enlargement that happen near the anus or in the space between one part and another, and they can be one fistula or multiple.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	As this inflammation ages, it opens up, allowing moisture, either clear liquid or thin pus, to drain from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas penetrate from within.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Thus, they are known to penetrate by what comes out from the discharge and its force when a patient discharges; perhaps it exits through them in a twisted manner.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas when they penetrate in the space up to the vesica and even the urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they can penetrate up to the hip joint and even to the node of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From the recognition of a penetrating fistula up to the anus, even from one that is not penetrating, it's as if you insert your index finger into the anus; and try to gently insert a thin instrument into the fistula with air or iron: when there is no curvature.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is curvature in it, then insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel any sensation within, and nothing comes out through the wound in terms of discharge, or swelling, or pain as I mentioned, then know that it is not penetrating. Therefore, proceed to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula penetrates to the urethra or the bladder, then its meaning is the discharge of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place may heal with medicine.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it indeed penetrates to the hip joint or the socket of the hip, then its sign is that it reaches there without any curvature up to the socket, and pain is felt around the area, and pus comes out from it always, and treatment does not heal it, nor does it improve with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And for all these penetrating fistulas, there is no cure at all; their treatment is a struggle and vanity from foolish doctors, over whom it is built.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	However, in those that are not penetrating and are not old, there is hope for healing with a bandage; as I will tell you, and I have already tried it: and it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back, and lift his legs up to his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his breath.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert a lead or air probe into the fistula if there is any curvature, until you know where the attempt reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the patient feels weakness around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel in your finger that it is trying to penetrate by itself, apart from what you feel between your finger and the anus or the flesh, then know for certain that it is penetrating. Do not therefore exert yourself on it, because its healing is not as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They also said that in some men, the flesh heals and relief is obtained from the application of a hot cauterization, as described previously, subtilely following the extent of the fistula, and insert the burning cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat the process twice or three times, until you know that all those added and filtered flesh have become dry, similar to a feather's thin tube.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for it with lint soaked in butter until the dried flesh is shed; then care for it with balms that produce and strengthen flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it does not heal with any other cure ever.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	If the attempt (to extract a foreign body) succeeds but does not reach your finger, which is inside the anus and between the point of impaction and the wound, thick with flesh or filled with pus: then you will see a fistula following the surface of the skin. You should dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and as you cut through the attempt that is in the fistula, continue cutting until the sectioning reaches the end of the attempted point, and the attempt is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered meats, which resemble feathered tubes of the ear, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	However, if the blood binds you and releases between you and your surgery so that you can cut those meats, then it is better and more quickly healed with heat or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Since cauterization with fire associates good habits, it adds to the burning of those meats, and stops the flow of blood, and dries up moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for it with lint wrapped in butter, or crushed scales, until the place emits pus, and those dried meats emerge from the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for the wound with consolidating ointments that harden the flesh: and these are medicines in which there is constriction and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when you restore, then it is already healed; and do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	However, if a fistula has already reached down to the deep anus and extends from excess fluid of the body: then insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a trial, and between yourself and it there is a wound from healing or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation on that unless according to faith and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is, because it is administered in three ways: either by cauterizing it, as we have said; or by cutting it off, until you obtain its detachment, so that it becomes possible for you to introduce the license and healing from next.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with the cutting, so as not to injure the ligament containing the anus, and cause a breach in the weak outlet of excretion without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of that as we said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed: either by stretching the wound itself and cleansing it after you have dried it close to the anus, as we said, or with attempts, or with another sharp instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filtered meats which are in the cutting, where you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt to restore the wound of the whole with a section, and the superior opening where it is being consolidated. And there will remain an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter over the inferior part.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes a fistula is sought after in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus; then take hold of the perforated ends, which are like a scalpel, that is, the preparing coria, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a wet thread from five threads around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with a thread into the fistula until it reaches its fullness.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it is penetrating the inner margin of the anus near to it, then extract the thread from that opening; so as to insert your finger into the anus and extract the end of the thread, and bring together both ends at once: and tighten each one, and release it after one or two days; and the more the thread penetrates into the flesh, tighten it well until the meats situated between the two ends of the thread are affected and fall off; then tend to the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in any way you have prepared for it, unless it is too deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	It is not for you to make that cut because of the laceration, lest you cut through itself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do as we said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the spine-like fissure that forms a fistula, whose hardness is acute and sharp, and the other part is not sharp so as not to cut what is unnecessary, as you can see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	§ On the stitching of haemorrhoids, from which blood flows due to cutting them; and on the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Head LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are haemorrhoids according to two modes.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are either inside the anus, like the seeds of figs or prunes, or as if they were new grains.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them there are small and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and it is one, but they are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremes.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are for the most part of little humidity, from which the citrine water flows, or with a slight frequent flow of blood: and they are according to the colour of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is to encourage the patient as you would a weak horse, and it should be expressed until the anus is relaxed and appears healthy to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, for that reason, also suspend them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If, however, they do not retain the hooks because of their humidity and the softening of both, then take them with a rough cloth or with cord made from double-twisted yarn, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and afterwards apply some warm, powdery substances over the cuts to help them heal in place.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or, cauterize them according to what was mentioned earlier in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then the patient should be given a enema with a small amount of medicine to facilitate what is in the rectum and obey the evacuatory process quickly when it expresses itself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	However, if the objects are external and attached to the anus, then they are softer and easier to remove; and it is as if you can catch them with your finger or with a hook and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with what we have said until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And if one avoids cutting with iron, then it is necessary to administer their stitching in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the soaked thread and insert it into the wound with precision.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull out the objects towards the upper parts and allow them to penetrate with the needle from the other side of their root; and wrap both ends of the thread around the needle on its lower part, so that they are lateral and tight.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then dry the thread and pull out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the objects and leave one behind; do not let it drain excess blood from itself.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Next, place a cloth soaked in rose or saffron oil on the affected area, and then place the cloth directly on it. Instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then release it until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the blisters have burst, treat them with ointment and any other necessary care until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	**On the care of fissures.**
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For they often occur from dehydration and the natural constriction of the body.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they have become old and are no longer responsive to medication, then you should use a knife or your finger to make small punctures in them, until they become moist and the upper layer of skin that prevents their healing is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them until they heal as necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If however they do not heal: then repeat the process with a stronger reason than before, until they bleed much, and then take care of them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	**On the treatment of wounds that do and do not open, as well as blisters and bed sores.**
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that the almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a key; and it appears throughout the body, particularly in the lower parts of the feet and between the fingers, and it causes pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut off what is around the keyhole, and hold it with pincers or a hook, and extract it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then take care of it: and if you want to cauterize it, do as was mentioned in its preceding chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	However, from the athelil (skin) after it is cut off, there remains a small eminence, rough, filigree, round above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often, these occur in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is to stretch the skin, and cut it deep; or tie it tightly with silk thread; or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you want, cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine as was mentioned before; and thus the skin will fall off, either turned inside out or not, without using any instrument that I have said.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	Formica, however, is also a small prominent eminence filtered and coarse, extending to the surface of the body, penetrating deeply within it; and when cold reaches it, it feels like a bite from a formica, and this occurs throughout the body, especially in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is that you take a small tube from the feather of a goose or a strong vulture, and place this tube over the formica until it contains the entire circle of the tube from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then, with your hand, turn the tube until you remove what is around the formica, and insert it deeply into the flesh, and extract the formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, make it with air or iron in this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Place your finger on top of the tube to draw out the dead tissue so that it does not grip or twist around your digit.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish to cauterize the formica as mentioned above in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery, do so.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	§ On the forms of instruments used for clistering in cases of ano-rectal disease, and of enema solutions, and for colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes the clyster (enema tube) is made of silver, or brass, or cast iron, or hammered metal.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes these instruments (enema equipment) are made in different sizes, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, what is administered for the treatment of young children should be light (in strength), and likewise their enemas, especially if their anuses are weak or painful.
Clistere magnum.	Large enema
Cistere paruum.	Small enema
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	His instrumenti (enema noozle) constructione habent sic ut supra diximus: the upper part of its head where the uterus is tied should be wide, and it should have a distinction (a specific shape) so that the uterus may be tied as you see, and its lower end which enters the anus should be blunt, not open, soft, very flexible, and on one side there are two openings, and on the other side one opening.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	The size of the opening should be according to the thickness of the radius, and it should be slightly larger than a palm, and the uterus (in which medicinal substances are placed) should be from goat's intestines or from paper tubes shaped like a small crook, whose root is one palm wide.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be perforated with many openings as required, and there should be space between each opening that is the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce into those openings a strong thread from raw silk, which should be about ten threads or so, and twist it with another one like a seamstress.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When, therefore, the other thread is placed in it, tie it at the end of the catheter between two strong constricting points.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then use the catheter.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the ring and holes as depicted here.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of using the catheter is as follows: to fill the other thread or use a warm wash from medicine according to the amount of tolerance of the sick person; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient should lie on his back and raise his legs towards the upper parts; and place under him a pillow, that is, skin or linen upon which people lie.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then moisten the end of the catheter with oil or alum or with a mucus of fennel or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce the instrument into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the assistant should take hold of the instrument with both hands simultaneously, and express it with vigor until all that is in the bladder is discharged into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the bladder, and elevate the patient's legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine encourages him to defecate, then he should retain it as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it throughout the night, it is the final step in the treatment.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	However, if you perform the enema on a patient suffering from abdominal pain due to the solution, and hurry its expulsion, then repeat the enema until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful fissures in the anus, then use a mild enema, gently, from the enemas that are used for children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a mild enema, over which the skin should be tightly stretched.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	§ On the healing of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have spoken about the treatment of wounds in the previous section of this book, and I will now describe here how to treat them with the hand and medicines as required.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore, I say that wounds differ according to the type of wound and the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The nature of the wound often resembles a stone thrown, or a cut with a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, wood, or arrow, and other similar things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that occur according to the places in the body are like a wound that falls on the head, neck, chest, belly, or limb, and similar ones from other parts of the body.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am describing the treatments for certain wounds in order to set down this reasoning and rule for the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the reader's memory of the composition will come at the beginning of chapter three.
Dico ergo.	Therefore, I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bones, consider whether it was caused by a blow from a stone or something similar, and has already damaged only the skin: then it is a large wound, and you should apply a cold compress to ease the flow of blood from the affected area. Act quickly and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately, without delay. Remove the blood according to the amount of force required, unless there is something preventing phlebotomy, especially if the blood flowing from the wound is in small quantities.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And if phlebotomy is performed on the opposite side of the wounded area,
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And the patient should avoid overindulging in wine and heavy food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	However, if something prevents reducing the blood, then the patient should reduce their intake of food and avoid meat and wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And if a hot abscess occurs, apply a poultice of rose oil or wine with astringent properties to the wound.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If, however, you are free from the hot abscess, then apply a poultice to the fresh wound if it still bleeds and has not changed colour; I will describe this later. And if it has already changed colour, then apply some ointment until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large or was caused by a cut with a knife or similar, and the edges of the wound are not approximated by small poultices, then approximate them with sutures as I will describe later on internal wounds and their stitching.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If, however, a wound has already been detected that is hanging down from the bone and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension, then incise it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore the hard flesh in place of the skin, and especially instruct the patient to take foods that are substantial, such as grains and cooked cereals, until it becomes firm like a pulse and similar to them.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you notice putrefaction on the skin that is not attached to the bone, then incise and remove the putrefied part entirely and throw it away; afterward, care for it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If, however, there is an artery or vein in these wounds from which blood flows, and it does not cut off through medicines, then seek help regarding the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not cut, then dry it with a spatula or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, there is a need to provoke it when it does not respond to what we said, then cauterize it until the blood stops.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If, however, these wounds are small, simple, then their cure is easy, light; so that you sprinkle on them this powder, until the wound is healed before it changes color.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method for Treating Wounds.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part olive oil, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts unburned lime; mix all together thoroughly and strain it: fill the wound with this mixture and apply a good constricting bandage, until it adheres well to the wound, and let it coagulate with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then tighten the bandage from above with small twigs, and leave it in place, but do not loosen it until it is certain that the wound will not reopen.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For this medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it becomes a sole hard callus, if you do not have olive oil, dragon's blood at hand, it still performs the same function in many large wounds, when applied and bandaged, and are fresh wounds with their own blood, which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If, however, the air has already altered it in some way, especially during summer, then this application of the powder is not in a position to be effective; therefore, take care of it with something prepared as we said, or place on it pastes made from barley flour, mixed with water and honey, until pus is discharged.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the rest of the healing until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If a fracture indeed occurs in the bone with a small wound, then it should be extracted with tweezers; and I will now speak of the treatment of fractures in the head regarding what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	**On Wounds of the Neck**
Caput LXXXV.	**Head 75**
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	However, if a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no distinct difference in treatment, and it is similar to treating a head wound when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	However, if a nerve or artery of the neck has already been cut, then there is no skill in it for treatment, except to use something that creates a constant constriction, such as a tight bandage or pad, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Since nerves cause pain and strain against each other.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold over the wound at all, since the substance of nerves is cold and continuous with the brain, which is the highest part of the body; and it should be treated gently from medicines, as a sore toe washed repeatedly with sweet water mixed with oil, or rose oil, and turpentine, when it is also drained with sweet water; and other mineral stones, according to this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If, however, the wound is large, then apply a stitch; otherwise, close its lips with small threads.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If indeed the wound is deep, or there is a cavity in it at the lower part where pus has already collected, then perforate it in a more depressed place within it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If, however, an artery has already been cut into the wound and its blood flow is occurring: then separate, or dry it, and tie that very one; or cauterize it if necessity calls for it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, the throat's cartilage or even its whole structure has already been severed and healing has begun: then close the edges of the skin with stitches above the throat's canal, and do not touch the throat, but rather equalize it to its natural form.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten the wound with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments that have hemostatic and drying properties until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, the wound has left an impression in the bone, then examine it; and if there are any fragments of bone within it, extract them entirely or as many as you can; and leave what cannot be removed, until the wound heals, so that pus does not drain out and the wound is separated and relieved.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder that I described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	However, if it appears in a wound that has an open bone and forms a fistula, then treat it according to what is mentioned in its respective chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	§ On wounds in the flat parts of the body.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a wound from a spear or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider the following:
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore from a wound there issues a flux of blood, and the patient grows weak because of it, then know that it is a mortal wound.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is fresh with its own blood, then do not put powder on it at first nor tighten the wound, so that the blood does not get trapped in its depth and return to the heart, causing harm to the patient; but apply a drawing ointment on it and loosen it once a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If you do not have any ointment at hand, then put on the wound a piece of old cloth to absorb what comes out from it due to moisture; and make the patient sleep over the wound so that whatever is gathered there can flow out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasms occur in the patient, nor any bad heart tremor, nor constriction in breathing, and you see that the rest of its dispositions are good, then know that the wound is sound.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it with care and with the appropriate remedies, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the healing of the wound excuses itself, and it opens up permanently, then know that a fistula has already been formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore, treat it according to its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut with a sword or knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it as you did before with the stitching, if it is deep; or with dust, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If, however, it has already made an impression in the bone, and a splinter is protruding from it: then examine the wound, and reach out to extract the splinter if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If indeed they are not separated, then leave them be until the wound putsrefies, for extraction would only worsen it.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	Judgment on the rest of the wounds' accidents in the remaining members is the judgment we have mentioned regarding their cure.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	On abdominal wounds, intestinal perforations, and their outcomes.
Caput LXXXVII.	**Head LXXXVII.**
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs in the intestine can be major, medium, or minor.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the major disruption, therefore, sometimes the intestine emerges or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why such an intrusion occurs, and why their stitching becomes more severe and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the minor disruption is also made difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that their reduction becomes more difficult if you do not act properly in their intrusion to the place they belong; because they are inflated, opened, and enlarged, making their entry more difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	For this reason, the medium disruption of them becomes better: because when their reduction is not difficult as it is in these two species, it becomes less severe.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the stitching of wounds follows four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	The two common stitches converge in the stitching of the abdomen and in the stitching of the rest of the body's wounds; and the other two stitches properly communicate with the rest of the wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper with regard to sewing up the entrails: and I will tell you about each one, with its exposure and explanation.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, because when a wound is newly formed and something from the intestine comes out of it, making it difficult to return it to its place, then that is the reason for one of the two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the fragility of the wound, as we said; or because there is an inflation in the intestine due to the cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is so, then you should warm it up, so as to immerse a sponge or a damp cloth in lukewarm water.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or dissolve it in a mixture of vinegar, squinant (a type of herb), and spice, and wrap the intestine in it until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	It makes wine within it, which has a constricting effect: and it is better than just water for resolving inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When you see that the inflammation is already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which other herbs have been cooked, or (alternatively) cold water.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	So that the entrance of it is facilitated with the decrease of swelling.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, his return after this treatment is delayed, then find in the rupture a small amount, with the instrument used to cut the hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the initial treatment is better when it is prepared than the cutting; and there should be no forced attempt to cut after necessity and the deficiency of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	That part of it [the hemorrhoid] which is bent, acute, and the other part not acute, and its tip is not thin like that of a needle, but rather blunt a little; and this one resembles chalk, as you will see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the wound expands and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that its reduction be made according to its own natural form in its proper place, if possible; for this is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the rupture is extensive in the lower part of the intestine: then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the intestine, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the intestine, then direct your attention and always keep in mind that the part with the wound be considered as the upper part compared to the other.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary that you should apply it to great wounds and to medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	However, for small wounds, apply it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it so that there is a faithful servant between your hands, who holds the wound entirely with his hand and closes its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then, take from that which follows the stitching some of it at a time, and this is the common way to stitch one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is necessary to take wax or a sharp instrument according to the quantity and width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then, leave a quantity of the wound's edge equal to the ring finger, that is, of the surgeon: and fix the wax in two parts on both ends of the skin when you insert it into the wound from inside, until you make it penetrate from another part, and you have already joined the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the sifac: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then, with a double thread, tie around the wound several times from both sides at once, until the two lips of the wound's closure are adequately joined.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then, leave the thickness of a finger and fix another piece of wax in it: afterwards, cut it with the thread as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not therefore cease to perform that with it which you need from the bed, until you complete the closure of the wound entirely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And there should be needles of medium thickness between coarseness and fineness, for the fine ones penetrate flesh very quickly, and the coarse ones are difficult to enter the skin; therefore, they should be of medium thickness in both fineness and coarseness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in both extremities of the skin close to each other greatly, so as not to pierce the flesh quickly or open the wound before its healing, and also so that they do not elongate with stitching, preventing the wound from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then incise the end of the needle so as not to harm the patient during his sleep, and place small pieces of cloth on all sides holding the ends of the needle, and release them until you know that the wound has already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And indeed, this type of stitching is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since it is enough for stitching them with one, or two, or approximately those needles.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second type of stitching is common, as it joins four ends: two ends of the skin and two ends with a single needle, with a thread of equal thickness to the needle in fineness and coarseness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, bring the needle back from the part where you began, so that the threaded thread falls from the upper part of the wound. Let the stitching be like the stitching of cloth with which cloths are sewed, and place between every stitch a quantity equal to the thickness of a small finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	However, people know this stitch.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch, I have sutured the wound that happened to a man in his belly, who was wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than one palm; and it had exited from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and there was a disruption in the middle of the stomach.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I therefore reduced it after the intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was therefore consolidated in the space of about fifteen days: and I took care of it, and it healed; and he lived after that for many years, restored to his former state.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors judged that he would not recover.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where I could not find ointment, nor anything from medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore placed a old, familiar poultice on the wound twice daily and diligently washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will now describe the two types of suture according to the narrative of this discourse.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And so it begins with the acute suture: insert the point from outside to inside.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle has penetrated the skin and moved along the wound according to the length and breadth of the entire body: leave the end facing sideways where you introduced the needle, and allow the other end to penetrate from the inside to the outside at the other extreme.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have caused it to penetrate in this way, then make it penetrate in the same manner from the outside towards the inside at this extreme: and leave the end facing sideways, which is on this side, and cause the needle to penetrate the other end from the inside out to the other extreme; and cause it to penetrate with your penetration as you cause it to penetrate into the leftmost extreme, which is in that part, until it penetrates into itself entirely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin again from this same side, and with the same end, which is on the other side facing away from the first, and extract the needle from the skin through which it had penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then insert it back into that skin, and with the same end facing away from before, which is on the other side, make it penetrate with this extreme; then extract it from the skin of its own part, and make one cut after another, and do so until it has entirely come out according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the essence of this suture is that it should envelop the skin like a cloth wraps around its edges, so that with one motion you pass over one part and with another motion from another side, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	A second type of suture, as described by Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	He describes his method as follows, in accordance with the practice of certain surgeons, who join all parts to their appropriate counterpart according to nature, applying one end of the suture to its other end and the other end to its corresponding end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is what I have described to you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You should now fix your attention on the end of the suture close to you from the outer part and make it penetrate towards the inside, and then release both ends of the suture.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then take the other end and make it penetrate from the outer part towards the inside to both ends of the suture.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then take both ends and make each penetrate from the inside to the outside towards the other two ends of the suture, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common facile suture, and it is the suture about which we have just spoken.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the speech of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And certain people said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the stomach is corrected with two hooks.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	Which is, as you insert into them one thread of each: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from what is with you, and make it penetrate until it reaches the other side, according to the suture of their corias equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the stomach, then its suture is more difficult than those of the other parts of the stomach.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the treatment of wounds, is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	Which is because when you treat a fresh wound with its own blood, before it changes itself with air: and you reduce the intestines, and their own self, and make them suitable: then place on top of the wound's flesh.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	Which if the air has already altered the wound: then place on top of it certain ointments that are present with you, until they form pus: and the threads fall out, and heal completely, and are healed perfectly.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as is done for the treatment of the other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	However, if you do not have these medicines at hand, then apply them immediately to it, from which it begins to discharge pus, and change it back to its usual state twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For indeed, you do not need other medicines in most cases when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	However, if these times occur, which communicate with the wound to the main parts of the body in the injury, then it is necessary that you immerse a soft cloth in oil of a moderate heat, or in rose oil: and place it around the areas that are between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If however, you feel pain, or punctures, or putrefaction within your intestines (which often happens), then enema it with a stippler wine, black and warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and become an exit penetrating to its innermost parts.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what comes from the thick intestine is of easier healing; and what comes from them of the thin is of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine called the jejunum does not allow healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and that is because of its abundance, which is due to the veins, and their size, and also because of the thinness of the body itself, and the closeness of its own nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, what proceeds from a wound is pus, and you obtain it fresh: reduce it according to your method of reducing the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If indeed a space has been left and it has now become hardened or black: then you should tie it up with a thread above the place that has turned black, so that there is no flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	In the pus, there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then incise what is beyond that ligament, and leave both ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so that the pull of it does not interfere with the removal of the pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	**Reminder of the wound that occurred in the intestine.**
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When there is a rupture in the intestine and it is small: then it is possible for it to be restored in some people; because I have seen those who were wounded in their abdomen with a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the old wound had become a fistula, and things came out from it, and gas.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I therefore applied the treatment until I was no longer amazed at its healing: nor did I stop subtilizing it until it had healed and the place had consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I had seen the wound healed, I feared for the patient, that something might happen to him; and nothing bad happened to him from that event.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in good health, eating and drinking, and engaging in sexual activity, and took baths, and followed his dietary regimens.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And certain experienced ones said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and is slight: then it should be bound in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is like taking ants of great heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two edges of the wound and place an ant on one of them that has an open mouth over the two edges of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it bites into it and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it sticks and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first, and keep doing this until all wounds are filled with ants in sequence, according to the number of wounds throughout.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then close it up and dress the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For otherwise the heads remain attached to the intestine until it is fed and healed, and no further harm comes to the patient.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible to tie the intestines even with a fine thread; this is obtained from the intestine of an animal, attached to it after being introduced into the wound.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is also possible to take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it will be much exposed.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then, tie the end of this fine linen thread with a stitch.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce that thread into the wound, and pull it through with the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce the swelling into the wound.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of stitching with silk and intestines is no other than according to faith and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is great, wide, especially if it affects one of the intestines' graceful loops, then there is no skill other than to narrow it, and its healing is not at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	**On the care of ulcers and fistulas.**
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound, or apostema as it ages and becomes old, forms an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and emits pus always, and is not cut off; then it is universally called fistula in any member where it may be, and we call it specifically "zuchemen".
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is, in truth, a hard, white, filtered knot according to the truth: it is without pain, but has the appearance of a feather's ear; and for that reason some call it risus, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And in some cases it is moist, emitting pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture may be divided in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes it is scarce; and it may be thick, or thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already mentioned in division, then when I speak of wounds, that every ulcer which is not healed, nor does it give birth to flesh, is not that unless it be for one of the nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is either because of lack of blood in the body, or because of its malignancy; or because between itself and the lips it has hard flesh, preventing the birth of meat; or because it has many sores and filthiness; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter sent to it is of bad quality; or because medicine is unsuitable in its healing; or because corruption descends into a region, which is a kind of pestilence, or through the property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where there is difficulty in digesting illnesses, and the healing of sores is delayed by nature; or because it has one mouth, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I now reveal all the causes and signs of these conditions, as well as their treatments with medicines in division: and here I must make you know the treatment of fistulas and incisions, which are made through a path of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore that a fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from them (fistulas) there are those that affect great veins and arteries, or nerves, or sheaths; or they enter the intestine, or a canal, or some rib; or they affect the joints of the spine or the composition of connected parts; such as the hand and foot, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, from these fistulas in this manner, is difficult to heal from illness, and it does not accept treatment, and dealing with them requires effort and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from fistulas any of which the depth does not reach to these places that I have mentioned, and you hope for and trust in its healing, and wish to discover it, then take a try with air or iron, if the fistula tends straight, and probe it with the same.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is a curvature in the fistula, then investigate it with a delicate lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Since lead, due to the softness of its body, is removed and healed around deformities.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If there is a fistula with many openings, it is not possible for you to apply pressure on it with your fingers.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, cleanse it from those openings through its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture that you use for enemas enters other openings and flows out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then examine it carefully according to what is possible for you: so that you may know if there is a bone or a nerve, and whether the fistula's cavity is distant or close, or whether there is a single fistula with many openings covering the entire area, with all your strength: when you ask about the patient's condition, and find pain at the compression with your hand over the place, and by similar signs and causes of accidents.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	So when you have considered all of these things, then proceed to treatment with confidence: and it is as you consider whether the fistula is close at hand, apparent, or in a safe place far from a joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I told you; then dry the fistula as was mentioned earlier from my narrative, and remove what is inside it from discharge, and corrupt flesh that grows in its opening from flesh, or pus, and similar things: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If there is a fistula of great depth and it runs straight, then you should cut it as deep as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then clean it from all corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply a clean, sharp knife to the wound: insert it into the depth of the fistula which you have reached with the iron, and do this several times until the acute medicine has corroded all that remains in the fistula's cavity from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal through that, then cauterize it as we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is confirmed to you, then probe it and dry it as I have told you; if nothing hinders you from cutting an artery, or nerve, or major member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If you detect bone that has become corrupted and blackened, then cut it until all of the corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with what makes it flesh again until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved complete removal of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, inspect it a second time and make a thorough examination of its condition and purification with all your remaining strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it heals, then it is good; but if not, then know that the corruption is deep and far within the body, which you have not managed to reach.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	You do not have any skill over it except to let nature release it.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If it is a small bone corruption and it is possible for you, then draw it out with delicate forceps that are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	However, if there are many bones, then make a careful extraction of all of them, and do not release anything from them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If something contrary happens to you from the humours and there is no fear or mistake in their incision, then cut away those humours and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed there is no preparation for removing the bone from your moment, then place it over the wound that is causing its putrefaction and leave it until it putrefies to what is around those bones in the flesh and humors.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And the incision should be constricted as much as you followed during your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	I suggest placing it over with a cloth soaked in tritured sulfur and oil, or in Egyptian ointment, or some other potent ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humors putrefy and the bones separate from them, their removal should be facilitated and their attraction eliminated.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	However, if there is a single large bone, such as the shinbone or hipbone, and similar bones that have been corrupted, then it should be chipped away with the final tool, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If indeed what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it needs to be tightly closed and cut entirely up to where the corruption stops; then take care of it until it hardens.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you of a cut that occurred in a man's leg: so that you may use this as an example and assistance for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man about thirty years old who suffered pain in his leg due to a condition that had developed inside his body, extending from the inner parts until it reached the leg, and it became a great abscess; and there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So much time passed with him due to the error of the physicians, until the abscess opened and many materials gathered around it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And the treatment of his leg was postponed until it became fistulated, and many openings were formed in it, which all discharged pus and bodily humors.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	So many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no skilled surgeon among them until I was called, and I examined his leg and saw the materials flowing from those openings in a great stream; even the entire body of the man had wasted away, and its color was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	I then carefully examined all the openings, and I found them connecting to each other in all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	We therefore removed and followed along one of their openings until I discovered the portion of the bone; and I found it corrupted, already corroded, blackened, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Therefore I prepared what had been discovered by me from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I determined that there was no corruption in the bone other than what could be removed, so I prepared to cut it away.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed the restoration of the wound with long spaces filled with consolidating medicines.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I attempted and discovered a second bone above the first discovery; and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I prepared what had appeared to me even from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore I discovered it again and did not stop striking the bone separately, and tried to restore it; but it was not restored until I cut away about one palm-width from the bone and extracted that with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated, and it was healed; and this repetition was not necessary in the operation itself, nor in its section, except for the arrangement of the weakness of the patient and the lack of his endurance, and my fear of death over him, because he suffered syncope from excess evacuation at all hours.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Thus healing is complete health; and firm flesh grew at the site of the bone, and a good arrangement was made within his body, and its strength returned; and it was restored to its previous state; and it caused him no discomfort in walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	However, if a prominent bone in a previously broken part of the body needs to be set, it should be done thusly: take the ligament and tighten it at the end of the prominent bone, especially ordering someone to extend it upwards; and place another ligament, this time with thicker woolen thread.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it over the flesh that is against the bone, and extend its end to pull the flesh downwards; and you will uncover the flesh above the place you wish to tighten, so as not to harm the cut with pressure.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood or a board under the lower bone precisely; for when you do this, it does not prevent but rather cuts the rotten flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the tightening be over the rotten place for a little while, so that there is no collapse of the bones; and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and it prompts another turn to tighten itself.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If a bone is corrupted and not protruding, then that part continues to be joined with the rest; the corruption is either in the middle or in some part of it. Then, remove all the flesh from those parts.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then apply the lower splint.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then, from the affected part on the first side, cut it with a saw until the joint continues from the other side; and make the lock according to the length of the corruption, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut that corrupted joint and saw through the bone where it continues from the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If the corruption is indeed in the continuity of two joints, then there is no skill involved except for filing.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the thumb or toe joint, then the case becomes very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	Indeed, it is necessary for you to inquire about the nature of the corruption as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And file it, and clean the affected area as best as you can, using any tool at your disposal; when it no longer causes any conflict with a vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you should know that there are many cutting tools and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bone, and their preparation, and the thickness of them, and their size, and their lightness or heaviness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare the instruments suitable for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations will indicate to you the nature of the instrument you need when you have a long study with it.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of these methods is a testament to the ways of illness; for then you will find within yourself what suits him from among the instruments for every disease.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am firming up for you in the conclusion of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will use as examples on which to cut and the proof by which you will experience over others.
Forma Serrae.	The shape of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of the other saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of the other saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the saw is depicted, made to be centered.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Make the bow of it curve upwards, its edge sharp as iron, and its handle out of boxwood, and have it shaped pyramidally in the center.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the intersecting rasors.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	This is the head of the rasor, according to the form of the locked star's head; and its points are according to the form of the elischefgi's points.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not fit unless the heads of the intersecting rasors rub against it, when they are bent or corrupted, or if the mouth is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of the larger rasor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the medium rasor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the rasor's side.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the rasor where it is concave.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of the other rasor's fine point.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The form of the other rasor's curved extremity.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of the surgical cut, a delicate tentation.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The manner in which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The form of the great cut as well.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a key, and its end is like a saw; it appears in many places for the reason of the bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the cut that relates to the reason it is pierced through bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, the tips are sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	It fits from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, it is necessary that all we have said about cuts, incisions, and saws be done.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	**On the cut of extremities and the locking of bones.**
Caput LXXXIX.	Head 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either from an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When, therefore, you have medicated that corruption with the cure of medicines, and it does not yield to treatment, and you see that the corruption has spread to a member, without anything being affected by it, then you must cut off that member up to where the corruption follows, so that the patient is freed from death or from the evil which is greater than the defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that this has occurred is that the member becomes discolored until it can be burned or rotten after turning black; until that rot is cut off where it follows the member and spreads throughout the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, when making the proper cut, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is due to the impact of some venomous creatures such as a scorpion, or a viper, or a leech, and others like them.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption or impact is in the tip of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption to spread to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it off at the base of the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption to spread until it reaches the wrist.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it spreads abruptly, then cut off the arm near the elbow at its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption spreads and you see it around the elbow, then that is the death of the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And beyond that care for healing, it is the quantity of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly for the foot, when there is an unexpected corruption in a finger, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it affects the nail of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	However, if it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill left, except to sever it and let the disabled one die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the manner of cutting off the member, or severing it itself, is such that you tighten the ligament below, which you wish to cut, and loosen another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the assistant stretch one ligament down below, and let another assistant stretch a ligament above upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the whole flesh is detached.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is cut or tied off.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you cover all parts with a linen cloth, and do not allow the knife to touch any healthy place; and cause an addition of injury to the sick, and a hot aposteme.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs internally while you are operating, cauterize the site quickly or place on it certain powders that stop the bleeding.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then prepare for your treatment until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the injured member with a suitable ligature and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you about what happened to a man on his foot, the same thing that I am telling you about.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	This is because a blackness occurred on his foot due to heating similar to burning from fire; that damage first occurred on his finger, until it spread throughout the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	The man therefore tended to himself, after he saw the damage occurring in his member due to the intensity of its pain, and the heat it encountered; and it affected him near the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed for him, the same damage occurred to his index finger.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with what I placed on his hand from medications after cleansing his body; but the excess did not cease, and it started spreading to other fingers, until the damage spread throughout the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He therefore called on me to cut off his hand, and I did not wish to do so, hoping that by doing so I could avoid the consequences of that surplus [tissue], but I also feared death for him at the very moment of cutting off his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Since the virtue of the man was superior to the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he had lost hope in me, he returned to his land, and later came back to me because of his condition, and cut off his entire hand; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not narrate this story except to serve as an aid regarding what happens in this condition, and to explain its meaning so that it is understood according to how it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	§ On the care of wounds and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members and the space of the abscess extends until it forms a collection of pus, then later it ruptures or perforates, and whatever is within it from the pus comes out, leaving a hollow place as if it were a cavity; and the skin over it becomes thin like a cloth that has been worn thin: and it does not reach its ultimate state of corruption, nor does it affect the mouth, nor the nerves, nor the ligaments. It deserves to be called an abscess, and not a fistula; however, if the space of the abscess extends until it affects some of these members, then it is called a fistula or ulcer.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the treatment for it is to incise that skin entirely as it has been weakened: and especially when it has become thin and like cloth, and you can be sure that it will not adhere to the place because of its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	However, if you hope that it will adhere to the skin and this final corruption does not result from it, and if there is thickening of the skin due to flesh, then treat it with a clister; and it is as if you were considering the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then, if it is large and the pus that is released from it has a bad odor, then clisterize it with Egyptian medicine, which consists of equal parts of vinegar, oil, and zinnia, mix them together for use, and heat them over fire until the medicine turns red, and it will become thick like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey, and clisterize the sinus with it; then close its opening and leave the medicine inside for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression; do this every day until the sinus is purified and the bad odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when you clisterize with ash water if this medicine is not available to you; and it is as if you were to take ashes from burning wood or ashes from holly wood, and throw water over them.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then take it and wash with it, until you trust that the sinus is already cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient cannot tolerate either the Egyptian remedy or water with ashes, then wash it with water and honey, to which something from crushed cumin has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or wash it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey to cleanse and wash away, and wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of tightness and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	Do this several times, and trust that the corruption of the sinus is already removed; then wash it with what makes the flesh in it come to life.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you take from the paste of dyafinicon; and dissolve it in rose oil, and astringent wine; or wash it with certain medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the orifice of the sinus is tight, through which the cannula for enema does not pass, then enlarge it with a knife; or put in it a moist lint in Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then add its lips with a stitch; and allow out of it as much as enters for enema without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And likewise, if the opening from which purulent matter flows is raised towards the higher parts, it should be cut in the lower part where it is located, so that the purulent matter can flow out of it to the lower parts; for when purulent matter becomes confined in a deep sinus, it prevents the generation of flesh within it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around its lower part as you wish, then try to prepare the member in such a way that the purulent matter can flow out of it easily according to what you have prepared.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try not to retain any purulent matter within it at all, and take the consolidative medicines placed on the wound, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over the linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a size that it makes communication with the entire sinus possible.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then, using scissors, cut directly into the opening of the sinus's foramen, making it slightly larger than the original opening of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend another linen cloth with unguents according to the size of the foramen, and place it on top of the previous one at a distance from the opening of the sinus, allowing the escape of purulent matter from it; but do not remove the large cloth unless after some days, once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	He who is above the opening of the sinus, it is he who moves at every hour to allow what has accumulated in it to come out; and you should know that the amount of fluid that flows from it can be great or small, or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And consider again the place of the sinus itself; does its lord feel pain there, or is there no pain, and is there a discharge, or is there none?
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment is carried out thus, and you see the material coming out from the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus has adhered or is close to adhesion; then resolve it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you have healed the wound, then change the bandage, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	However, if a subtle fluid comes out from the sinus after a long space of time, then do not despair about its adhesion, for healing is approaching, since there are people whose flesh takes a long time to heal in their wounds, and others who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If however, after many days, undigested pus comes out from the sinus, then know that the sinus is not adhering.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then add to the drying medicines, true physicians, that their substance may be humid, and their virtue dry; such as dyeing ointment, when a surplus addition is made to it from the skin.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last of the more important ones that it treats, it is to take a dyeing ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and then apply it over the top of the ancient equal wine in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then make it into a paste with it and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does this similar action when you do not have the dyeing ointment available, using honey instead, after heating it until it thickens, and then using it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense: mix them all together, and sprinkle it over the honey while it is still on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then cover it with a cloth and squeeze it over the sinuses, and mix the honey you have heated until it thickens with it, until it becomes thick: then sprinkle the mixture over the top and place the cloth on top and squeeze it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when it is administered with the long wormwood and the roots of the heavenly lily, and there is a lily, and flour of herb and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple or mixed, squeeze it and sprinkle over the honey I described, and use that.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the condition of the sinuses does not improve with this treatment, then know that there is corruption within it, or it has already left an impression on the bones, or on the hard remaining members, or on the ligaments, then treat it with the fistular cure as mentioned above.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the treatment of panaritis and the application of ointments, the addition of a cut digit, and amputation.
Caput XCI.	Head XCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritis is an abscess that arises under the thumb nail of the hand or foot, and perhaps in other digits as well.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When this condition is prolonged and its treatment neglected, the abscess becomes heated and infected; it decays, emitting pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, or perhaps corrupts the entire digit, spreading as far as the bone, until it emits a foul odour; and the extremity of the finger becomes enlarged, and takes on a dark colour.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When, therefore, you treat it as we have described in amputation, and your treatment does not remove the excess, then it is necessary to cut with a knife the entire remaining part of the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Cauterization, indeed, is very useful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If the bone is indeed healthy and the nail still intact but the edge cuts into the flesh and begins to pierce it, then you must place a thin beam under the angle of the nail that is piercing the flesh, and push it upwards; cut the flesh easily with this, and put over what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, until it is entirely removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then, care for it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	However, if the corruption has already affected the mouth, then it is necessary to cut that part of the mouth and remove the affected tissue; for it will never heal as long as the corrupted tissue remains.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you observe that the corruption is progressing to the finger, then cut it off at the joint, as mentioned in the previous advice.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however, the nail becomes frayed or struck, and it causes extreme pain, then it is necessary to use a leech to draw blood from the affected part first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail using a sharp spatula, cutting across it from top to bottom.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And take care, so that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail; for you will cause greater pain to the affected part, and it will impede healing at the site.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the site with something that soothes pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The true finger that is born in some hands of men may be entirely fleshy; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, or maybe it has a nail; and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or their origin is in certain knots on the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, he who is born with certain finger nodes does not move, and he who is born near the joint of the finger perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, he who is among them (the fingers) is fleshy, his section (amputation) is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which is, as you cut into the same near its root with a broad spatula-like instrument.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	However, the one whose birth is at the joint's root, its treatment (healing) is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from cutting it (the finger) off.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In him who is born in a finger near the last node, then it is necessary to cut into his flesh first with a round (incision) up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then, saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it (the wound) until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The healing that occurs in the fingers, however, often happens due to either birth (present from birth) or from the healing of a wound or burn and similar conditions.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary to remove that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a thin layer of lead or soaked cloth in rose oil, so that they do not adhere quickly, and separate them; or place between them a thin sheet of lead, until the place is consolidated as necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And likewise, if there is a consolidation of certain fingers with the palm, then dry that consolidation according to what has been prepared and suits the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	§ On the incision of defects.
Caput XCII.	Head 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	These are veins that are inflated, thick, filled with melancholic excesses which occur in many parts of the body; and their flow is greatest in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk and work, and bear weight.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to administer purgation of the body from black cholera several times with strong purging.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then make bloodletting on the veins of the patient with a lancet.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these conditions with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	It is one of them, so that they may be bled, and black blood is extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And another method is that the vein is made to pulsate, and all of it is extracted.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The true section of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	It cuts the leg first with much hot water until the thick, foul blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then it tightens the leg of the patient from the lower part of the thigh to the lower part of the leg with bandages.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then it dries the vein at one, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then it makes it pulsate, that is, extracts the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and you must cut the vein at the top with a phlebotome first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then apply ointment to the lower part until enough blood has drained out as you see fit, and as much as the patient's strength allows.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards, bind it and strictly advise the patient to refrain from foods that cause black cholera, and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are filled and it causes harm to the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The preparation of this substance is as follows.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	If there are many hairs in the wound, remove them.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce the tip into a bath; or use a sharp instrument to puncture the leg with warm water until it turns red and the veins bulge; or perform vigorous exercise if there is no hot bath available, until the limb is heated.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin with a clean cloth along the length of the vein; or at its end near the knee, or at the lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with forceps and strip away the vein from all sides until it becomes visible; and at its appearance, you will see it turn red and then darken.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore the vein has been withdrawn from the skin, you will see it as white as if it were a chord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert the blade underneath until it is completely removed from the skin; suspend it gently with a hook and let it drain.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another section near that one with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then elevate it with the rods as you did before, and suspend it with another hook as you did initially.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut another section, or multiple sections, as needed.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then elevate it again, and make an incision on the last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract it towards the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you have extracted it from the upper section or all higher sections, then make an incision on it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If, however, it does not obey you when extracting and elevating, then insert a sharp two-edged blade and tie it, and extract it by force: or insert under it a rod, and turn your hand to every part until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful, so that it does not get cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it gets cut, it will be difficult for you to elevate it, and the injury will spread from that point.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	So when you have completely extracted it: then place over the wound a bandage soaked in rose oil or oil, and tend to it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vessel (i.e., the vein or artery) is contracted due to a twist, and this twist needs to be corrected to reach its parts, and it is not as we said according to rectitude, then one must find a way over it to every part of its twist, and the places where its own untwisting should occur.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you have entirely extracted it; and be careful not to cut the vein or injure it near your section, for it will be difficult to lift or extract it afterward.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, be careful with your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The shape of the incident that heals the vessel.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The shape of the nearby blind (i.e., blocked or obstructed) vessel.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not as hard as the other vessels, nor does it have sharp ends that would injure a vein; instead, it is of great flexibility and softness. If it were thin, it could pierce the vein with its thinness, but on the contrary, it has excessive thickness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the vein of the thigh.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as those of Alizegis and the Arab land, and in dry, hot lands with little tenderness, that is, where grass or trees do not grow.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed, its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs beneath the skin, as happens within the bodies of snakes and tapeworms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the onset of the course of this vein is what happens in the leg with a severe inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	It then becomes narrowed.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to exit from that narrowed place, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When it therefore appears from that end, then you should cover that segment with lead, whose weight is a keil of a drachma, up to two drachmas and the spot itself; and let the lead be suspended from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever anything emerges from that [vein] towards the outside, cover it with lead and seal that spot.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged much, then cut off that part and sew up the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it completely until it has come out entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and goes into the flesh, causing an ulcer and puttingrefaction in that place, making a bad wound.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore, it should be treated gently and extracted gradually until the last part comes out from its place, and nothing remains of that in the body: and from this vein, in some people, flows a blood vessel five palms long and ten, in length.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has reached me, because a man has come out from twenty palms (or fingers).
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	However, if it is cut during your treatment time: then insert a probe into its opening and make a long hole with the body, until all that is in it of matter is evacuated, and administer treatment to the place's putrefaction with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care with the cure for the ulcers.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot itself; and it has many openings, and a branch goes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore, treat it as we have said in the division and with what has been mentioned above.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	On the division of worms generated under the skin, and it is said to be a "boil.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This boil is called a "boil" in some lands among us: for it often happens with cows, and it is a small worm, which is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it crawls throughout the body, ascending and descending: and it is seen by the sense when it moves from one part to another, until it breaks apart wherever it breaks in the skin and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes, that is, roundworms (lumbrics) and hookworms occur in the intestine.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And fear is from its evil.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when it crawls throughout the body and ascends to the head, and reaches a place, then perhaps it opens within and comes out, and destroys the eye: and that happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to cure him and extract it, then that can only be done during his walking and the appearance of it to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to tie what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry it above and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is deeply inserted into the flesh and you cannot find it, then place a cautery on the spot with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And worse than that, it is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	However, if you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then tighten a good strain under it above the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry it above and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary for the patient to use purification of his body with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And he should beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the cutting of a wound according to Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This affliction is called Nakir in our land: it is a pain that occurs in certain members (limbs), and then it spreads from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And indeed, I have seen it myself, according to what I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I have been called to attend a sick woman in certain parts (of her body).
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she exposed her arm, and I saw a slight swelling in the vein at the end of her arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after remaining for an hour, I saw one swelling move with a quickness, like a bowstring moving up towards her shoulder more quickly than it can be said; so that it looks like living silver running from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore the pain subsided from that place and it became fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then after an hour had passed, it became still, and it moved into the rest of her body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	He then told me that it was turned inside out throughout his entire body, as I could see.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed, therefore, at the speed with which he moved from one part of the body to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I, indeed, had not before seen this sickness with my own eyes in such a way according to this manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who discover the pain changing from one part of the body to another; and not see it with their eyes as they see it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that this is otherwise than because she was a woman among those who are discovered to have such dry body passages; from here, therefore, appears to the senses that change of air took place.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and have humid bodies, hidden passages.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	So if you see the cure for it and the patient feels that pain, then if it is apparent to you as we said, then tighten above and below it quickly; and dry above it until that air released by constriction comes out; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If, however, you do not see it with your own eyes: then care for it with the discharge of the body, and with what it expels air currents, and poultices them with foul-smelling pills, and pills of serpentine, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of sagittas (arrows)
Caput XCVI.	**Chapter XCI: On the Head**
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows (sagittas) differ according to their kinds, and also according to the places from which they exit from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	The true diversity of these (arrows) is that some have large barbs, and others have few; some are pointed, and others blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them (arrows) are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And from them (arrows) there are those that have barbs.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And from them (arrows) there are those that have stars (or points).
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	These (arrows), indeed, according to the members (or parts) from which they exit, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or these (members) are indeed from the main, concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and spleen, and lung, and kidney, and intestines, and similar organs.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it (the arrow) exits from any of these members, and you see signs of death (as I will tell you later), then you must strive to extract that arrow from them, for death follows it where it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and there is no arrow hidden deeply within the member, then extract it and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when an arrow falls into the brain and penetrates a bone, and emerges on top of the brain, it is—since these things happen from that strong blow, and darkness, and giddiness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasms, and confusion of mind, and choleraic vomiting.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood may emerge from the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech may be lost, and voice destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And from the site of the wound, white humidity resembling pus emerges.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it exits from that, resembling the moisture of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not emerge.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are as follows: that it is near the left breast; and it feels as if it were firmly fixed in a hard substance, not in something hollow.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse: and blood flows out from the wound black.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And this follows with chillness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Therefore know that death descends without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of the arrow when it strikes the lung is the spurting outflow of blood from the wound; and the limbs that follow, they turn pale, and the color changes to blue.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And the great, deep breath departs; and it seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into a wound within the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and this causes almost all of the upper body's limbs to move, with great pain and a deep breath.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested will emerge from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and becomes lodged there, then something like feces or bile will emerge from the wound, or even broken intestines.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope for his recovery, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder and urine flows out, and something comes from it to the outside, and the pain grows stronger over the injured part, then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining members, such as the face, neck, throat, ribs, sternum, backbones, furca, coxa, leg, and foot, along with similar parts from other members, are to be treated in many ways according to their positions; when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve, and is not a deadly arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I have seen these arrows to be as if they point to a sign for your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Which is the case because an arrow struck a man's eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore extracted it from his other side, beneath his ear fat; and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had struck him in his eye fat below his lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I could not get it out except for a small part of its tip, with which it was stuck in its wood; and this was a large arrow among the arrows of the Turks, with soft iron, without ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Health is thus achieved by the Jew, and no evil befalls him through his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of the Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabian arrow, and it is that which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I therefore followed along over that same between the two guides: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was therefore subtile with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought, because he was perishing from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	Afterward, when thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed over him regarding his condition from following the arrow; I pondered over it, and extracted it, and he was healed, and no evil befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw the man to whom the arrow had struck his back, and the wound was healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Afterward, therefore, after seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman whose bowstring had pierced her belly, and the wound was healed over it, but the bowstring remained inside: and nothing changed from its original position, and the woman found no harm from any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man whose bowstring struck him in the face; the wound healed, but he did not feel much pain, and similar cases are numerous.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted a bowstring from a man who had been struck in the middle of his nose, and it was already shifting towards the right side: and the bowstring was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore called upon to treat him after the bowstring injury for up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I therefore found the wound from the bowstring to be very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I therefore examined it with a delicate probe, and I did not feel it; he himself, however, felt a pricking and pain beneath the skin on his right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that it was the tip of the bowstring causing that puncture.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore applied a poultice to the place, using one with strong drawing and healing properties, confident that the swelling would go down and I would see a sign of the bowstring's path, so that I could cut it out above it; but nothing happened at the site that indicated the bowstring had been embedded there.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore, he applied an emplaster to it for many days, and no complication arose, and the wound became consolidated; yet the patient remained weak from the extraction for some time, until on a certain day he felt an arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	He then told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I then applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened; and when I tried to pull out the arrow, I felt the fine tip of it still adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added more of that sharp medicine to the opening of the wound until we could see the end of the arrow; and it took about four months for me to remove it with him.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had healed enough, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, I tried to turn and move it, but it did not yield; then I did not cease trying subtilely and ingeniously on it with means of mechanisms until one day, when I properly formed the forceps according to their final shape in a chapter, I managed to extract it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I healed the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the doctors judged that the nose cartilage would not heal.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I therefore restored it, and the wound became healed and strengthened, and the sick was made whole with complete health: not a thing at all harmed it.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you the quality of removing some arrows: so that you apply that rule and meaning to what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and the distinctions thereof are not comprehended with narration; nor does that book comprehend it, and a prudent artisan compares with little to much, and with what is present to what is absent, and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descent of external things in this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that arrows do not emerge from the members in which they are fixed, unless according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or through attraction from the place from which it entered inside.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or conversely of the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding in the flesh, and is attracted, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	Which if it does not obey to coming out from the time in which it fell, then you must let that one go for a few days, until the flesh around it putrefies; and its attraction is released, and its coming out.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And likewise if it is fixed in the bone and does not obey you to come out, then leave it for several days, and repeat the process of drawing and moving it every day until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If after several days it still does not obey you to come out, then you must drill around the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine knife until the arrows are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it out and extract the arrow.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	However, if the arrow is fixed in the skull and has already penetrated into one of the brain's ventricles, and symptoms of some of the conditions I mentioned appear, then refrain from drawing the arrow and leave it until it becomes suitable to be drawn out after several days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the brain tissue, then death is not prolonged for it.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except only within a bone and does not penetrate to the brain tissue; and he remains weak for several days, without any of those conditions happening to him, then apply your skills in drawing and extracting the arrow.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	However, if it is fixed strongly and does not obey you when drawn, then apply a knife around the arrow as described, using a wooden board; then tend to the wound until healing occurs.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow is already concealed within the body and is hidden and disguised from the senses, then search for it with your probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then draw it out with instruments that are suitable for attracting it.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If, however, you cannot reach it due to the compression of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there are no bones, nerves, or vessels there: then find a place above it until the wound expands and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If there are any other parts that should be held onto, then release the fixed flesh from all sides using every means and tool at your disposal, until it becomes possible to dislodge the arrow without damaging the bones or distorting them.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be located, then use a twisting movement of your hand, along with pincers for all parts, until you make it come loose: and with the final subtlety, so as not to break the arrow, and to make its attraction and extraction difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot reach it right away, then leave it for several days until whatever is around it putsrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat the process: for it is now necessary, if the flow of blood opposes you, to apply what we mentioned from treatment in its chapter: and guard your strength from cutting into a vessel, or nerve, or string.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And use your skill in every way possible to achieve the escape of the arrow: and let it be with ease, tranquility, or delay, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And you must, as you draw the arrow, make it weak according to its figure, according to how it was at the time of the arrow's departure from the bow.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more powerful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	However, if it is not possible for you, then use what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	However, the arrow that exits from the opposite side of the other part, or has already proceeded from it towards the outside: it causes the end of the arrow to be bent due to the tension from the upper part of the nearby skin, and you will see it sticking out: so dry it above, and make the cut according to the amount that the pincers can grasp.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it: for indeed, it becomes easy to exit.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If indeed it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness until the arrow impresses itself into the bone and expands itself: then pull it.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: let it go for several days: then repeat until it exits.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If there is a wood of the bow (Sagittae) within it, then push it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	However, if the wood falls and it is necessary to apply an impulse: then insert a sharp instrument into it so that its sharpness enters the end of the bow; afterwards, push it with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	However, if the bow is bent, then push it with an instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The bow will be straightened by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the bow is damaged, then it is necessary to use a sharp knife to cut off all the corroded part where the string is attached, if you are able to do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it with what is appropriate for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the bow falls into the chest, or the abdomen, or between the ribs, or against a side, and it is close to where you touch with your hand when you try to lift it, and it is possible for you to cut it above that place: then cut it, and cauterize the wound from the string, or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound, if you see one, and take care of it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of forceps by which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The ends are similar to the face of an ear, made like iron: when they grasp an arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And they come in many shapes, large and small, medium-sized, according to the quantity of the arrow's length, narrowness, depth of the wound, and tightness.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the impelling forceps is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of the impelling forceps is also that of a hammer.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is like the end of a hammer, which drives the arrow into the concave entrance and pushes it along with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The end of this concave forceps is also concave like a bird's wing: to drive the arrow's entrance into itself and impart its impulse.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	**On Phlebotomy of Veins**
Caput XCVII.	Chapter 97
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins that are subject to phlebotomy, of which there are thirty in the body according to custom, are called the jugular, femoral, and saphenous veins.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	From these in the head there are sixteen: two pulsatile veins, which are behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries, which are visible in both temples; and two veins which are in the two lacrimal cavities of both eyes, called the observing veins; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is at the end of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two guides, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins, which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins, which are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	And these are the veins called Algcherich.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins, which are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	However, the veins that are bled in the arms, there are five veins in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is cephalic, and it is from the lateral sinus; and the common people call it the vein of the head.
Et Fusca.	And Fusca.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And it is a median vein, and it is composed of the branch of the basilic and the branch of the cephalic; and common folk call it the body's vein.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And the basilic, it is situated on the inner side of the body; and it is also called the titillar vein.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	And common folk call it the abdominal vein.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And the vein of the forearm, it is situated above the joint; and this is where blood-letting is performed, and it is the visible vein that appears above the thumb.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And the superficial vein; it is the vein situated between the ring and little fingers, and it has two branches.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And there are three veins in the leg and foot.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is situated beneath the curvature of the thumb on the inner side of the finger.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second is the saphenous vein; its location is near the heel on the inner side of the leg.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	And the popliteal vein; its location is near the knee on the outer side of the leg.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And there are three veins similar to these in another leg.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	**On bloodletting from two veins behind the ear.**
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	True, bloodletting from the two veins behind the ear provides relief for chronic catarrh, half-headache (hemigrain), and old head sores (sahafati), and also for various old ulcers of the head.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of bloodletting is as I have described.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is done by shaving the head of the patient: and the back of his head is rubbed at the location of the two veins with a rough cloth for good friction.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then the patient tightens his neck with tension until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And the locations of those (veins) are behind the ears at two depressions in the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore, seek those (veins) with your finger, and where you feel the pulse of them under your finger, there mark with hot wax.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take the phlebotomy knife, and that is what is called the "Incidens".
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then he inserts the needle under the skin until it reaches the vein, and continues until the leech (phlebotomus) reaches the bone (os).
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then take your hand with the needle and move it towards the upper parts, and cut the vein with a wound that follows the curve of the skin incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And the length of the incision should be about the size of two joined fingers, or roughly that; and let it allow as much blood to escape as desired.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then tie it with threads and let it go until the wound is healed.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And this has already been explained at the beginning of the book regarding the incision and cauterization of these parts.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	§ On phlebotomy of two arteries at the right time.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	The two arteries that are used for phlebotomy at the right times in case of an old hemicranium (migraine), are the saphenous and the temporal artery; and they aid in a strong (sodam) and continuous (obtalamiam) flow of acutely flowing excess blood to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of phlebotomy for these is according to what I have told you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	He stretches his weak neck much until two veins appear clearly to the sense; and the pulse of them is felt under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then indeed the signs with wax.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then he draws the skin over the vein towards the upper parts with his index finger, and inserts the phlebotomy instrument below, and draws the vein up to the higher parts.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And he cuts it, as you did with the other two veins: and lets the blood flow according to the amount necessary for you.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then he loosens the ligature of the lower one, and places his finger on the vein at that very moment.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Afterwards he places a bandage and strips over it, and tightens the same with a strong constriction above: and leaves it until it is healed.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	And now let us recall those things, and the incision of them, and their extraction at the beginning of this book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	§ On phlebotomy of the vein on the forehead after phlebotomy of the cephalica (vein in the head).
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	The true instrument of phlebotomy for the vein on the forehead is after phlebotomy of the cephalica, for old facial affections; and for hemigran and redness; and for bad ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of his phlebotomy is, according to what I tell you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	The patient narrows his neck with vomiting until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	Then take the instrument called the "Fossorium.
Cuius haec est forma.	Which has this form.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	Place the sharp point of the Fossorium over the vein, and strike it with a plectrum, or any other instrument in its manner, and let the blood flow according to the amount desired.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then open the lower perforation and tie it off until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And when it is opened with the side of the phlebotomy tool.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary for the phlebotomy tool to have a sharp point like other phlebotomy tools, but rather it should be wide at the end.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And the phlebotomy should be made according to the turn, since the vein is close, and perhaps the phlebotomy tool may break when it is too thin.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	On the bleeding of veins in two lacrimal regions.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	The treatment of the two veins that are in the two lacrimal regions of both eyes is for eye problems and redness, as well as for conditions in the eye and face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	And the quality of the bleeding from them is such that it tightens the weak neck with bloodletting.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	Then perform the bloodletting on them: and you should stand over their head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	And the bloodletting should be made according to the length across a little, with a small, flat phlebotom, for it is not painful in that place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	If the phlebotom is too thin, it may break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	Then make it flow out of blood as much as is necessary for you.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	And place a cloth over them, bind them once at night, and loosen them in the morning.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	¶ On the bleeding of the veins of the nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	The veins of the nose, when bled, refer to acute fever, sudden pain, and face conditions such as migraine and redness that occurs on the face: especially when it is long-standing.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	And the quality of his phlebotomy is such that it tightens the patient's neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	Then take his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long phlebotomy tool, and place it in the middle of his face, between what distinguishes the nose according to its straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Since the vein does not appear there to the senses, and since blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And you should, with the phlebotomy tool in your final hand, make it flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then bind it that night as well.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	It will indeed be restored quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	**On the Phlebotomy of Arteries (of Guido)**
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	The true power of Guido's phlebotomy is to constrict breathing, stop the onset of leprosy, treat melancholy ailments, impetigo, bad ulcers, and corrosive, that is, worm-like afflictions.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	And the quality of his phlebotomy is such that it tightens the patient's neck from both sides with a bandage: and the artisan should be standing over the patient's head, and the patient sits on a seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	Then, the phlebotomist applies a wide vein-punch to the length of the desired incision.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	Then, he extracts a moderate quantity of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for that.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	Then, he does the same for other veins.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Then, after loosening the ligament, he tightens the two veins with a medium constriction so as not to cause weakness.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And leave it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	The wound will heal.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	**On the Vein-Punch of Albucasis.**
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	The vein-punch of Albucasis, however, is effective for: since it leads to the flow of blood in the mouth, and the corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, and cracks in the lips, and bad ulcers even in the nose and its surroundings.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of such vein-punches is that it makes the weak heart sit before you and tighten his neck with a strain.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then he resolves the lips, and looks at two vessels: one is from the right lip, and the second from the left. And the proof of each is through the blackening of their colors.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And that is true because around them there are small, black vessels.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore cut each one with an incise cut.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If, however, there is doubt about which one it is, and you do not know which is that one: then turn your attention to the larger cut of them, and those that are more apparent.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly, do with the two vessels that are in the upper lip: and indeed, custom most often runs with it. And cut the two vessels that are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	§ On phlebotomy: The veins under the tongue after the cephalic phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Indeed, the two veins that are under the tongue, their phlebotomy is for conditions that are in the throat, and the pain of the jaw, and diseases of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that it seats the infirm between your hands in front of the sun: and elevate his tongue, and look under his tongue, from one side he has a vein, and from the other side he has another vein: and the color of each declines to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore, the phlebotomy instrument for both [veins]: hold and guard, lest you use your last hand in phlebotomy on them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under it [the vein] there are arteries, and perhaps the flow of blood may happen from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	§ Of the three veins in the forearm.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	However, the three veins that are bled in the forearm—these are among which phlebotomy is customarily performed on all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And phlebotomy of them is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with the myrtle-shaped phlebotomy tool; or by making it incline to thinness with the oil-soaked one; or by cutting with the knife-like phlebotomy tool, which is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is the shape of it.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus, Alnesil is what pertains to cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them there are wide and thin kinds according to the breadth of the veins; and the form of the myrtle-shaped phlebotomy tool is wide, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it comes to opening the concave veins, full, proceeding, visible, thick, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomist is of lesser width and more delicate extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is used for phlebotomy of the delicate veins that contain thin, yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	**On Phlebotomy of the Basilic Vein.**
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	However, the basilic vein, being one of these three veins, has the greatest effect for phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it extracts blood from the ailments beneath the throat and neck, following to the chest and vein; and the phlebotomist should use caution when performing phlebotomy on it, as there is an artery beneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs and adds to the puncture for phlebotomy, he strikes upon that artery, and a flow of blood occurs.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, one should not perform phlebotomy on it with the phlebotomist's knife; instead, it is better to use a scalpel (alnesil).
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the basilic vein does not appear with a clear manifestation, then one should use other veins, or switch to another, or seek out a branch of it; or perform phlebotomy at the site of its arm (funem brachii).
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	Indeed, it is evident, and dry it with a phlebotomist as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	However, if you wish to perform phlebotomy on the same part, then you must apply pressure before the tightness of the arm, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with wax, afterwards the arm, and dry the vein with a concave phlebotomist, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful not to hit through the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, an inflammation at the place you marked with wax, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore let it go.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	Which if you see blood rising at the time of phlebotomy like urine from a boy, and it is thin blood, red: then know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore act, and place your finger on the same long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore blood is withdrawn (it is often withdrawn many times), then tighten the arm and release it: and let the patient be careful from its motion: and it should be above his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And it should not be moved for several days until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	However, if blood does not drain and it binds you, and you do not have a ready remedy at hand, then cut the artery if it appears to be the case.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities contract and the blood drains.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or accept the fistula skin and find it, take one-half and tighten it over the vein's constriction with a bandage and a little thread until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood drains, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then care for it yourself with the one whose memory precedes regarding the flow of blood from the place where the wounds drained; and the draining of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the wound's small location, and the possibility of binding with the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	**On phlebotomy of the dark vein.**
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The dark veins, however, require a phlebotomy that draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for it is composed of the branch of the basilic vein and the branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it happened to the phlebotomist that he should place himself over her, for fear of her bloodletting, because there is a nerve under her.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds to the bloodletting in the puncture and finds a nerve, there occurs in her a stupor, and her healing becomes difficult, and perhaps she will not be completely healed.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	However, if it is hidden in certain people and is subtle and not apparent, then you should place your bloodletting where the phlebotomist places his cut with alnessil (a surgical instrument) and gently press on the nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	**On the Cephalic Vein**
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The bloodletting of the cephalic vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and conveys it to eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And in this vein, if you wish, as the phlebotomist does with a sharp phlebotomizer or a soft one, since it is the healthiest of all veins, as it is not beneath an artery or nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is customary for you, in the act of bloodletting, to remove only the top part of the vein with a leech, and then seek a softer place; and it does not hurt him if it is not found with initial percussion, so that it can be passed over several times with bloodletting.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, it may be abandoned in some men when not bloodletting in the initial percussion, but it does him no harm that aposteme in some way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	§ On the usefulness of bloodletting and precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of bloodletting, and its accidents from it, on which you must reflect carefully.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First of all, you must know that bloodletting is not administered unless for the preservation of health, and its continuation, and caution against the onset of illness.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And bloodletting should be done on one of the three veins in the arm, namely the Cephalic, and the Falciform, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And bloodletting should be done at the beginning of spring over fasting, on the skin, and in summer and autumn and winter after a meal, when signs of replenishment appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let phlebotomy be performed on the first day, or on the third day, after three hours have passed from the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, phlebotomy performed in illnesses does not have a determined time; but when the occasion and necessity arise for it, it can be done at night or during the day, and at any hour or time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary for boys to have phlebotomy done until they reach the age of fourteen years.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman have phlebotomy done unless it is from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should the elderly, who have already passed sixty years, be subjected to phlebotomy.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	So, when someone wishes to have phlebotomy for any reason, they should purify their bowels before phlebotomy with a gentle enema, if much feces is retained in them; so that the veins do not attract harmful putrid excess from the intestines to the main members during phlebotomy.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient have phlebotomy done when they are constipated, that is, after a full meal or due to nausea; nor should they be purged or made to vomit from drunkenness until that has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor should the patient with hydrops be treated in this way.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And bloodletting should be repeated after the patient has suffered from colic, vomiting, abdominal flux, frequent sexual intercourse, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything else that dissolves strength from the body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtleties of the humors before that, if the blood is thick due to food, drink, and medicine: if it is possible for him to correct that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then he should take a bath, if nothing prohibits it: or exercise him with some exercise, in order to thin the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his bloodletting in the chest around the third day, as we said: and try to have his chest void of all animal misfortunes on that day, such as distress, anger, fear; and of all bodily misfortunes, such as labor, pain, excess, and others like them.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make his seat present the things with which habit and custom of men are governed by aromaticity, perfumery, festivity, and similar things in a way that is possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then he should sit on the bed, higher than the place where the bloodletting is done; then he should pull his arm, and rub it against the bloodletter's hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	He then tightens the ligature with a clamp and wraps it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And the tightness should be moderate, because when the tightness is uneven or due to excess in the tightness, it prevents the flow of blood; and when it relaxes, it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	After the tightness, it is necessary that the one performing the bloodletting gently presses with their hand until the veins bulge and signal to the touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist should clean the bloodletting site with a little oil, traditionally used.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his left hand's index finger above the vein at the site of the bloodletting, lightly: so that the vein does not escape and is not harmed by the pressure.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because from the veins there is a flow like a string escaping during bloodletting; and from them is one that flows with full force: and when you place the phlebotomist over it, it contracts under the phlebotomist and deceives the phlebotomist, and he does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is tight. Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then the phlebotomist should withdraw.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore a vein is opened at once from one cut, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat the cut at that place again with a little less force or above it with haste; otherwise the place will not heal.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If the place heals or becomes weak, then release it after one or two days; and do not tighten the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps indeed the healing place attracts heat.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should a bath be taken.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he may repeat bloodletting if necessary.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small or the blood flows gently, be careful not to remove too much; then repeat the bloodletting in the same place according to the right method and add a little force to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	Do this with haste before the place heals; for indeed, when a place has healed, it is often too weak in many people after surgery.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see that the place has already healed, then do not repeat over it at all; for indeed it will not heal with you anymore.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something of the dreg of oil on top; for it will ease the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than pure oil or any other oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly, use the dreg of oil in all your phlebotomies, when you draw veins near to the obstruction of the blood flow; and it makes the wound heal faster, becoming calloused or hardened, when one of them is applied to that place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood becomes thin and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	This is especially true when the place of phlebotomy is large, which often happens, especially to those who have never been bled before or have a small vein opening; then apply immediately and put over the place a sponge soaked in warm water and salt, and press it tightly for a short time; for this resolves it.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary to do this after the blood has left the vein, either with its complete flow or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If after a few days any blackness or redness remains at the site, it does no harm; and if you wish, apply something of aloe or myrrh dissolved in water; or some of the juice of mint, that is, mint tea or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And indeed, many times, complications and prominences occur during phlebotomy in the basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore, place your hand upon it, and if you feel any softness at the site of your compression upon it, then that prominence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, place something upon it as we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood from the artery may flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with that which has constriction, so that the place hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it as with the rest of the cure until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to extract blood from every person according to the amount of their strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color rising above the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it becomes red; and likewise, if you see that it is thick, let it flow out until it thins; and similarly, if it is sharp, let it flow out until its sharpness is gone.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And he who is full, strong, and requires the extraction of blood in one dose, so that phlebotomy of the vein may be amplified and he becomes a phlebotomist on one side, should be opposite to him who is weak.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract the blood deeply into the veins, and make a narrow opening, and better still, for phlebotomy of the vein, to make a transverse section rather than a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood and from cutting a nerve, and it is more commendable and healthier than phlebotomy through width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And he who is accustomed to performing phlebotomy by the syncopated method should give the patient a moderate amount of bread soaked in warm grape juice or water before phlebotomy, and extract blood from him in three or four doses.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the patient's complexion is chilled, then he should take bread soaked in a thin syrup, or honey-sweetened syrup perfumed with spices, or an aromatic odorous syrup before phlebotomy.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	Should the syncopated state occur during phlebotomy and be the cause of excessive blood loss, then he should drink a mixture of meat broth and a subtle aromatic syrup, and use aromatics with compresses, and apply them to his chest, and use the rest that we mentioned in the division of the chapter on syncopes from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	He who wishes to cure his arm and drain his blood a second time: he whose phlebotomy is for extensive evacuation, and whose virtue is weak, so as to drain blood slowly according to the quantity of his virtue over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	He who truly wishes to cure his arm and drain his blood a second time, and his body is strong: then he should do it after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	He who wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part from which it flows: he should do so on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is a great amount of blood that is already heated and irritated, causing fever: it is necessary for him to drain blood from his body in one time, and extract a large quantity: and increase the opening until fainting occurs: after you have preserved all conditions of phlebotomy: and put your hand on the pulse near the flow of blood, so that death does not occur at the place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Indeed, it often happens that this occurs when the phlebotomist is ignorant and falls through negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you wish to drain your arm and drain blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed, and draining blood becomes difficult, as you force it with haste, and the wound extends quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a great evil, indeed, leave it alone until it can be bled again a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Remove it carefully with the forceps after the bleeding has stopped from the wound where the blood has clotted, and place over it some salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place over it some of the alum or sage, and apply a gentle compression until the blood flows out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed the vein has already burst, then leave it alone and do not press on it until the swelling subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If it becomes necessary to open the vein a second time to let out the blood, and there is no excuse for this, then either use the same forceps on that very place or move to another vein in the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The forceps used for phlebotomy should be at the wrist of the arm (fusca and basilica), as they are not easily found and are hidden because they are composed of these joints.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that a weak person should insert their hand into hot water until the knife becomes red and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is tied over the place with a thin string with a moderate tightening.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Next, the phlebotomy should be performed according to the cross-section, gradually, not across or along its length. The opening should be wide, and your phlebotomy should be made through it, slightly above the joint of the hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the escape of blood is prevented, then repeat the hand in warm water and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	However, if it were the summer season, then you would excuse repeating the hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed, the most blood is put into warm water in winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the phlebotomy of this vein is healthier for all veins, because it is not under this vein that there is pulsation or nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The phlebotomy of the right hand's Saluatella vein is truly beneficial for liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that it tightens the skin of the hand with a ligature or your own hand, after you have introduced it into warm water until the vein bends and appears very sensitive to touch.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then perform the phlebotomy by crossing it.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely through, it will not harm her in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful, do not exert your hand too much with the phlebotomist.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it, the nerves of the fingers are exposed through the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat the hand towards warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will clot in the vein's opening and be prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	So when you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not solidify quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise, it is necessary that you do with every branch tightly.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The true instrument of his phlebotomy from the left hand is: since it is conveying to the spleen's diseases; and likewise do in his phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	However, the instrument for phlebotomy on the saphenous vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menstruation, and kidney diseases, and old ulcers of the coxa and crura, and similar diseases from other ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that the patient places his foot into hot water; and he makes friction over it until the veins burst, and ties above the joint of the foot with bindings.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed, the veins are located near the calf, facing the thumb, and they branch out from there on the face of the foot into many branches.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, the phlebotomy should be performed in its wider branch or near the calf in its gathering, as it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If the phlebotomy is performed on the face of the foot, then it should be done carefully because of the nerves that are under it on the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy such that it goes through the vein, as if you wanted to cut it, and let the phlebotomist be neat.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If, however, the exit of blood is prohibited, then repeat the foot in hot water and allow the blood to flow into it until it is emptied.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the phlebotomist mistakes the vein in the first attempt, then he should repeat with the phlebotomy slightly higher up, for the place is safe and there will be no harm from it to the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly, when the saphenous vein of the other foot is equally affected.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The sciatic vein, as we have said, is located, as we have mentioned, at the side of the calcaneus.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the method of bleeding it is, for the pain of the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of the bleeding is that the patient enters the bath and hurries: and he tightens the leg from the side of the ankle up to the calf with a thin, long blade: for it does not appear unless through that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then perform the bleeding according to whatever skill you have, or according to transversion: and it is better, either to cut it with an incision, or to slice it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is the saltiest, and it itself is hidden from many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all: then bleed one of its branches, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot, and goes towards the ear: and take care from the nerves, and let the blood flow in a quantity as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then he loosens the stricture and places it over the site of phlebotomy of the skin, and tightens the site.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	In this way, it is healed promptly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	§ On Drainage, and the nature of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	They are made from horns, and from metal, and from other materials.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And drainage is performed according to two methods.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When performing scarification and extraction of blood: and another is drainage without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this drainage which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the drainages that are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are fourteen places on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	There is one that is the ventilation of the alnocratis, and it is the last of the head; and the alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and the ventosas of the Alhagdahim, and they are two blades of the neck from both parts simultaneously; and the ventosas of the mind, and it is under the mandible in the lower jaw; and the ventosas of the two spatulas; and the ventosas of the Alachosos beyond the end of the tail; and the ventosas of the two forks, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the ventosas of the two tendons; and the ventosas of the two jaws.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	Indeed, ventilation does not extract blood from the small vessels scattered in the flesh, and because of that, the strength does not leave them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it necessary to administer ventilation or with fire, or without fire in any illness that arises from fullness, until the whole body is emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity requires ventilation to be administered due to illness or out of habit, we do so at every hour at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any time it may be needed.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because there are people who, when the blood accumulates within them until it needs to be extracted through ventilation, find a heaviness and soreness in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from them, there are those who experience fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from them there is one who discovers itching on his face, and on his forehead, and darkness, and drowsiness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from them there is one who scratches the place of his sweating.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from them there is one whose laughter is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from them there is one who discovers the taste of blood in his mouth; or he may lose his tongue and spit out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from them there is one whose sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from them there is one who sees in his sleep blood and ruddy colors, and slain bodies, and wounds, and things similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something of them, and it is indeed in the third hour of the day: then we order the sweating to be done, after two or three hours have passed from the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The sweating of the nape, however, is: because it contributes to weight on the head, and what flows down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	Indeed, it is necessary that this be done after the sweating of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this, indeed, is the place for the operation of phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permissible to use this one who has a cold complexion or where there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it causes great harm to that part.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that, it is not appropriate to use these on the elderly, and on whose head there are diseases of a cold nature.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	However, he who practices it frequently, forgets about it.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of this, you should instruct the wind-blower to place his hand with a slight movement towards the lower parts, lest forgetfulness arise from excessive use.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Bleeding by wind or cupping is the place for the operation of dark (phlebotomy) and basic phlebotomy, and because of that it causes coughing, constriction of the breath, cracking of the skin due to the instrument, coughing, and fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary to move the wind-blower slightly, because if it is placed below, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Cupping, however, causes sudden pains in the head, eyes, half-headache, perforation, and pain in the roots of teeth; and it is the place for basic (phlebotomy) bleeding.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you instruct the surgeon not to rush with his hand in the act of incision; so as not to cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	However, the procedure of ventosation under the chin applies alcohol to the mouth and combats gum corruption and similar afflictions in the mouth; it is used instead of phlebotomy, which is performed on both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The procedure of the spatula, however, applies alchafacha, which is made from folding and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The procedure of the interior parts of the two forks provides aid to phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica; for it itself attracts blood from all those small veins in the flesh, and those small veins attract blood from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three main veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the surgeon not to proceed too far in the incision; for the place is stripped of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	However, the ventosa that is blown over the anus treats hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the surgeon that the ventosa should be large and made of air; for the place needs a strong suction, and the delicate vents may possibly break: and a great incision should be made.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The veins of the crura decrease visibly by virtue of attracting blood from the entire body and transporting it to old wounds in the kidneys, matrices, and vesicas; they provoke menstruation, bring on sweating, and stand in place for two phlebotomies, one of the saphenous vein and another of the albicoca.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the connection of the albicoca veins is close to the connection of the two crural veins.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the veins is to place the vein in the first hollow and apply gentle suction; do not prolong the position of the veins, but put them quickly and move them quickly so that the humors reach the place with equal access; do not stop repeating this and continuing until you see the place already red and swollen, and appears bloodshot. Then, scarify and repeat suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those of tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary to scarify just once, not repeatedly; so that the place does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And especially the vein, to amplify the scarification, make it deep; and regulate suction gently, quickly, and with its own movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is excess fluid in the blood, then it is necessary to perform the incision twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Indeed, the first cut opens the way for the clarification of blood and its fluidity, and in the second, the meticulous extraction of the thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is very putrid, then a third incision should be made to achieve the ultimate result.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And for the final, when we want to extract blood slowly or a little at a time, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we want to extract much blood, we perform many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary for it to be incised with a deep incision, and the depth of the incision is equal to the termination at the skin's depth.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which needs to be administered from oils at the position of the Wind (i.e., the direction or flow of air), and what should be cautioned about the wind?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In the case of skin that is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary to apply to the Windy places with open oils, such as lard, castor oil, sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the winter season, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or rose water: and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If indeed the excess is thick and cold, then oil of amaranth, or oil of balsam, or white oil, or oil of anise: and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If indeed the pores of the skin are wide and tender: then it is necessary to prohibit oil, and it is necessary for these places to be washed after ventilation with rosewater, or with cold water, or with sunny water, or with cucumber water, or with portulaca water: and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He, whose blood is of great humidity, should wash the wounds with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac: and similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	He whose excesses are thick, should wash his wounds with old wine, or with pomegranate water, or fennel decoction, or chamomile: and similar ones.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary to be careful with ventilation in a bath, or in a bathing track, indeed, it is necessary for a treatment to be administered after leaving the bath for one hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary for anyone to sleep after ventilation.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is required for the regulation of Ventosandus or Phlebotomatus before ventilation?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, you should consider first: if Ventosandus or Phlebotomatus is choleretic, then sharp and inflammation of his blood must be restrained; then he should take cooling things such as granatum (pomegranate) rind, and also endiuiam (a plant), vinegar, lettuce, and fennel, and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And remove his food particles, and the flesh that is moistened, and foods seasoned with herbs; and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And for one with a cold disposition, it is necessary that he take a drink of syrup made from honey, or from almonds, or from fennel seeds; and also medium-scented wine, which is between old and new; and he should be instructed to consume little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And remove his food particles, and drinking water; and birds, that is, small birds; and let the pigeons' chicks leave.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of ventilation and bleeding be more than food; and it is necessary to give some men in the hours of tyro (fever) alfafa, or a medicine from moss, that is, moscate, or essence before ventilation: and before phlebotomy, or after, so that the principal members are strengthened, and the blood is purified.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary for them to take it in a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	**On Pneuma (Vents) without Scarification**
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	However, the pneumas (vents) that are without scarification are those placed over the epare (skin), spleen, podagrum (big toe joint), over the ventrem (abdomen), umbus (navel), and the locations of the kidneys and ankle bones, since these members do not suffer scarification on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought through these (pneumas) unless there is attraction from the member of blood to the member, such as we place a pneuma over the nipples in the illness of bleeding nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them (pneumas) to solve the cold ventosity that has entered the member, such as we place a pneuma over the abdomen and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it (the pneuma) does rarefy the member, and warm it, and remove pain therefore, because it resolves that ventosity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It (the pneuma) is also placed over the kidneys when there is a swelling or stone in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	By the force of its attraction, it may perhaps open a swelling or remove a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And he does likewise when it is placed on the wound, and the spleen near the flow of blood in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these incisions are made with sharp tools when the sections are only made.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are applied with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are applied full of warm water in cases of pleurisy: and that is to fill the bell with warm water alone, or with water in which herbs that have been boiled are steeped.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	# The form of applying the bell with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Its opening should be wide enough for two fingers, according to the form we make; its depth should be half a palm, and there should be a small hole on its side in about the middle, large enough for the needle to enter: it can be made of iron, brass, cloth, or leather, smooth and even, so that it does not hurt the body when positioned over it, with a crossbar in the middle made of iron or steel, where the candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this bell becomes large, larger than we have described, and sometimes smaller, according to the illness and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	The windpipes of boys and those that relieve congestion are different from those of men and thick bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this windpipe over the member with fire is like kindling a small flame with fire from linen or a candle, and place it over the middle of the pipe that is in the center of the windpipe, so that the fire is ignited around the lower part of the windpipe, without burning the body below.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed over the member, and a finger is positioned over the opening that I have mentioned, as long as we hold the windpipe. When we no longer need it, we remove the finger, and vapor will escape through that opening, immediately soothing the windpipe.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then use the fire according to its manner, and repeat it if you need it again.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in the case of a ventosa used to treat pleurisy with water, there is no pipe or opening, and it is not applied unless the water is filled and placed only over the member.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the better this ventosa is, in that it can hold a great deal of water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	On the suspension of bloodletting vessels.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodletting vessels should not be used in many cases, unless the members do not allow the placement of veins, due to their thinness, such as the lips, gums, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a member stripped of flesh, such as the finger, nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of their use is such that you should come from bloodletting vessels that are in sweet water, clean from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be left during the day and night in sweet water until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is evacuated first with bloodletting, and with veins.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the infected member should be washed until it becomes red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then they should be placed over it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are inserted and fall off, and it is possible to draw out the suction of the place with veins, then it is the greater help in healing; but if not, then withdraw the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then, with much water, it is rubbed and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the flow of blood continues after the operation and it is oozing, then dip a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top, until the bleeding stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the amount of blood is excessive, then sprinkle it with a powdery substance such as dried herbs or similar hemostatic materials until the blood stops flowing.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they can be placed over the wound as a compress of peeled herbs, and left until the beans adhere to the place, as the blood stops flowing.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And if it is necessary to repeat the operation, when possible, the instruments should be changed.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	However, if the hemostat (sanguisuga) cannot be suspended, then the wound with fresh blood should be cleaned.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or fix a cold compress over the places until something from the blood is discharged.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they should be applied, as when they feel something from the blood, they adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore the stitches start to fall off, sprinkle over them something of powdered aloe or salt or ash, and they will immediately fall off.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	The Purpose of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	The Third Part of the Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A universal discourse on restoration, displacement, healing of twists, and similar topics.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine, as it deals with the restoration of broken bones and the displacement of accidents.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O Sons, that foolish doctors reject this chapter and deride it, and those who have never examined the ancient book or read from it a single letter.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, this method is secluded from the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never found it at all beneficial, and I have not acquired that from it unless through the length of studying ancient books and the effort to understand them, until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experience and study, through the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from that in this Chapter everything that contains my knowledge: and beyond what my experience has passed, after I have shortened it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and shortened it to the end of abbreviation, and shown it to the end of declination: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of the instruments that are administered in it, with it being through the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In summary, and collections from the existence of bone fractures, of those whose mention is necessary before we begin the remembrance of the broken limbs, and various ones, if any one of them.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we should say in the Prologue to this Chapter, the main points of the discourse, and the Chapters, to whose understanding the first artist is led to the truth of them: namely, so that you, and those who are eager, know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when someone suffers a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or some other accident: then it is necessary that the nearest ones should first attend to drawing blood from him, and resolving itself, or both at once: if nothing prohibits, such as weakness of strength: or if it is someone who has suffered something from these, a child, or an old decrepit person: or if it is during a sudden heat, or sudden cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be content with his food, cold odors, and birds' meat, and avoid wine, fat meats, and filling himself with foods that clog the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are free from the heat of illness and no longer suffer from the discharge of matter to the limb, then the patient should return to his usual routine with which he was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the broken bone begins to heal, then the patient should be given nourishing food in large quantities, such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, rice, heads of cabbage, feet, entrails of animals, eggs, and fresh fish: as well as heavy wine and similar foods.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this regime, the healing of the fracture will occur more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in young people who are not yet old and wrinkled, cannot continue to grow and strengthen according to their natural state because of the debility of their limbs; but those which have healed at the end of their weakness, such as the bones of a boy or girl, will grow and strengthen.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature joins to the broken bone something similar to glue from every part, which becomes thick and adheres to itself, until it is once again joined and bound, until it reaches the end of strength and firmness, as it was in the beginning, unless something prevents it from performing its functions; and for this reason, it is necessary to give the patient food rich in weight, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you should know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of members: for a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the bones of the skull; and a fracture of the bones of the chest is different from a fracture of the bones of the back; and similarly all other members are distinct in this regard. And I will come to recall with remembrance every type of fracture presented in its chapter, distinguished from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	The types of fractures of the bones also differ within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For it becomes an arc-shaped fracture, besides the occurrence of stars (or bone spicules) therein.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone; and these fractures are sagittal, that is, stars (or bone spicules) and additions proceeding from them, as they are in a reed when it is prepared to write with a knife.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And they do not proceed: and it is a fracture with a blow and disruption at the head: and it is a fracture of a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every species has its own nature or proper instrument for its restoration, according to what comes to mind when it is remembered, distinguished in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that which is known about the fracture of a bone, its curvature and prominence are determined, as well as its appearance to the sense and sound it makes when pressed by your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When there is no apparent deformity or sound when touched, and the patient does not experience intense pain, then it is not a fracture, but rather possible that there is a deformity or a small crack; therefore, it is not necessary to move it with the hand and compression completely, but rather apply medications as remembered, after which a tight bandage should be placed over it.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should know that when the place curves and splits into two, apart from what happens there due to heat, every part moves away from its comparison; then you must start from your time towards straightening it, equalizing it before it suffers a hot delay.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	However, if a hot delay happens to it, then leave it for several days until the delay rests.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to any way possible, from gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and equalization are easier than the bones where deformities occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to what comes to your remembrance of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If indeed there are deformities in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this fractured member from its two parts, if it is a hand or foot: either with your hand, if the member is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the member on an equal surface with its natural figure, until when the parts of the fractured member are extended; then try to cause them to return to their original positions by all means possible, and according to whatever mode you can in their places, and beware, according to your strength, that your operation does not cause pain or injury to the weaker part.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And at that moment, you must try and touch it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it and equalize it with your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of sudden stretching and strong compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	Indeed, they often cause a burning sore or contraction in the member through their operation, as we have seen many times from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then connect after equalizing, and a decent operation, and tightening that member, and rest, and tranquility: and warn the patient about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make it a priority that it does not move in its hour of your affairs, and sleep, and rest, and agitation, and during its digestion, and all its movements with the utmost strength of itself.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And so it should be avoided that the position of the member does not precede the pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	For it is because when he feels pain or injury in the position of a member, then it is necessary to change that very member to another position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And moreover, so that its position be equal and straight, in order that there not be curvature in the member when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of tightness of the fractured member is, according to what I have described.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured members differ in their fragility, magnitude, and form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	So what are fragile from among them, such as the arm, finger, and foot, and similar to these, then it is necessary that they be wrapped with soft, thin cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But what are thick from among them, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary that they be wrapped with wide, hard cloth in them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the wide ligament connects the large member and tightens it from every equal part of restriction, so that it does not enter into any stain itself.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin to apply the dressing after evacuation from the equalization to that place, using a soft pad over the site of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage over the site of the fracture three or four times, according as the member requires, and briefly grasp your hand with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then bring it to the upper part from the site of the fracture, and tighten less than your previous tightening where you fixed the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch it with the bandage at the site of the fracture slightly, and soften the tightening gradually until you reach a great improvement from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another cloth and wrap it again over the fractured place with bandages.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then bring the bandage to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And your work is in the tightening and softening of the bandage, according as we said in the first wrapping at the upper part.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the bandages a soft pad or cloth to adjust the curvature of the fracture if there is any; but do not place anything if there is none.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then insert another plug over that same wound.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	After that, equalize the pressure over these newly made incisions immediately, if there is no swelling or a hot discharge at the site.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	However, if there is swelling or a hot discharge in it, then place over that part which has the discharge a poultice to remove the swelling and leave it for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie over that same incision.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the incisions (astellas) should be made from the middle of a broad reed, carefully shaped; or they may be made from wood, where sieves are formed from pine, or palm branches, or tongs, and the width of every incision (astella) should be according to this form and figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the incision (astella) placed over that same track be somewhat thicker and broader than the rest of the incisions, and its length should be according to what is permitted by the member's size and thickness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie over the incisions (astellas) with another bandage according to the first tightness.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind it from above with well-woven threads according to what we said about tightness, and it should be so that your tightness over the fracture site is greater; and as much as it is elongated from the fracture, the tightness should be less.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that they (the threads) be of medium size in terms of thickness and fineness, and made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are too thick, as is often seen in the crude work of ignorant surgeons who use twisted linen cord for their stitches, it is a great error; for the tightness of the stitch is diminished by their thickness.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And very fine threads do not work either, for you will not achieve the desired result through tightness with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that they (the threads) be less than the width of a finger between one stitch and another.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the weak thread is damaged at the ends of the stitches after tightening in healthy places, then place under them a piece of soft twine or dyed wool until nothing is damaged from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with a wound, and a tear occurs in the skin, I come with a remembrance of it in chapter second according to its singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured limb must be bound with threads from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	This is because when the limb is large, you should not place stitches on it from the first day, unless after five, or seven, or more days, according to your safety from the occurrence of heat-related complications.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters by which the ancients restored what was placed over a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	Common plastering method abbreviated for restoring a fracture, consisting of several layers, particularly suitable for women and children, since it is over what does not give way to either heat or cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And take some flour from the millstone and the core of the flour that hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the wheel, and make it just as it is, except that it is strained with sieves together with the bran: and do not make its thickness too thick or too thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of plastering for restoring a fracture, dislocation, and twist.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take alum, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugath, and sugar, of each one-tenth part of myrrh and aloe; all these are crushed and strained, and mixed with water or with bran if the plaster is to be heated by the sick.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	Indeed, this is a good mixture, it restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of applying a plaster that also helps to reduce fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Prepare a mixture of all the following in equal parts: myrrh, aloes, acacia, terebinth, and powdered stone (silex). Crush them well, sieve them, and prepare them with water or albugine, and administer them.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method for applying plasters to joints and separated bones, alleviating the pain of their injuries, and reducing bone fractures.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take succid (a type of wool), immerse it in vinegar, boil it in oil, and apply it to the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	This plaster is not a virtue of restoration, but it is beneficial for relieving the pain of a burning wound; it drives away pain naturally.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	A method of plastering that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take thin leaves of the fig tree and thin paper from birch bark, mix them together, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	A shortened method of applying plasters for restoring broken bones, to be used when you wish to see the healing of the remaining wound.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recite the root of high tansy, chamomile, flowers of violet, and herb flour of all parts in equal amounts; they are all triturated and prepared with wine, unless a member is heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If indeed it is heated, then prepare it with moist coriander water or water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	§ Another method of the plaster is stronger in resolution than this first one when a hard ulcer occurs near the restoration of the member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recite the root of high tansy, linseed, ballast, melilot, samas (or samsh), violet flowers, and chamomile, all in equal parts; they are all triturated and prepared with willow water, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of it should be according to the warmth of the member and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a broken member at the time of its restoration, unless it has become cauterized with lead and oil; nothing else: and he reported that it should be a medium between hardness and softness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, was seen to place on a broken member at the time of its restoration substances that dry up heat, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, and similar ones that we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	A method of applying a plaster that promotes healing and alleviates pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Mix equal parts of meal, chickpeas, human hair cuticles or chicken feathers, and owl's earwax and salt: grind them, sieve them, and prepare the paste. And so it becomes a plaster.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity, however, should be such that it remains to support the wound, and then it is dissolved as you consider it, if the patient does not experience pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place; in this case, do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it happens that there is a severe itching or disturbing pain or swelling: then apply and dissolve the plaster at once, and remove it from that place. Take a soft cloth or a moist marine sponge, and immerse it in warm water and wash the place with it until the itching stops and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then allow the limb to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place a cloth soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, on top of it and bandage it for one night, until you are free from the heat of the inflammation, and the swelling of the member subsides, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the process with a tighter but still delicate bandage and a smaller plaster: do not apply too much pressure or tight bands with your hands, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you observe that the ulcer, redness, pain, swelling, and all other symptoms have completely disappeared, and you now need only a poultice and compression, repeat the treatment as you did at the beginning equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If none of the things we mentioned occur in a limb, do not relieve the pressure on it, unless after three, four, five, or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when after twenty days the whole of it is relieved, according as you perceive from the healing of the limb, as we said, until there adheres a fracture and the coagulation of the flesh above it approaches; then add to the compression even more than your first compression, and also add to the intake of the weak diet, according as the preceding remembrance of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If, however, you see that the place of the fracture is already healed and weakened more than it should be, then know that nourishment is prohibited from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, soak it with warm water whenever you relieve it, and do this for all three days, and apply a little compression every day.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this manner of treatment, the limb is supplied with nourishment, and it is soon healed.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	However, what the ignorant healers do when they extract something from a fracture at another time, other than as it should be restored according to need and restored according to its curvature, is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it had been right, they would have said so in their ancient books, and treated it accordingly.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen their mark anywhere on it at all, and it is better that it not be made.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	**On the handling of an accident in the head.**
Caput III.	**Head III.**
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	**The kinds of fractures are diverse, and their forms many; their causes are distinguished.**
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	**For there is a fracture that occurs from the blow of an axe: the blow removes the bone entirely until it reaches the sapwood, which is under the bone, just as an axe splits wood; and because of this, this type of fracture is called axial.**
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	**Or, the blade strikes something of bone, and it strikes its face, and the cut does not penetrate to its end; and this is called the black fracture, that is, complete rupture.**
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	**And it is a wound of two fractures, either great or small.**
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	**And there is a fracture that is a crushing or grinding, and its cause is the blow against a stone, or falling on a stone, or something similar.**
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	**And this fracture is also either penetrating, which approaches the membrane under the bone, or it is on the face of the bone; and it is a wound of these two fractures, also either small or great.**
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from this fracture is one that is hidden within the bone, subtle as a hair, and it is a small split, hence this type of fracture is called capillar fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these, there is a fracture caused by an accident or the impact of a stone, and similar conditions where layers of bone penetrate inward, creating a cavity: as happens to a pot when it is struck, and part of it enters the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this occurs most frequently in the bones of the head, as in the cases of children's skulls.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these types of fractures become separated, and I have seen them return to their original position with memory alone.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures through inspection, testing them with the hand, and removing the corrupted flesh that is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The capillar fracture is recognized by detecting it on the bone, cleaning it, and binding it with wax: for indeed the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of fracture, however, consider first the condition of the patient: if you see that from the accidents there is a clear indication of fear, such as fainting, stretching, loss of intellect, paralysis of speech, syncope, acute fever, redness of the eyes, and similar conditions in many arrangements, then undoubtedly it will not heal. And if you see that the condition does not terrify you and you hope for healing, then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	What to do if a wounded person comes to you in the first days after being wounded: and that is, during the colder days, then it is necessary that you study the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all arrangements.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is during the warmer days, then you should strive to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the tissue under the bone rots from the condition we described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has already reached the tissue that touches the brain, and it is with small pieces and attraction: then you must cut the fractured part, as I told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And you should examine the head of the wounded person: and lift the bone as much as possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is lifted above the weak part.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If this happens to you during the examination of the bone, such as bleeding or hot swelling: then counteract it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And you should fill the space with cloth soaked in wine and rose oil: and make the wound rest until the swelling subsides, and be secure from blood flow.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the healing of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The first method is to cut the mouth with a sharp knife of straight edge, and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then, another knife is applied from the wider side of the incision, and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then, another knife is applied that is yet wider than the previous one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is to have a number of different knives at hand, some wider and some narrower, all with sharp points made of iron or steel, so that by striking them lightly upon the knife, it will not hurt the head or harm itself.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the bone is very hard and dense, then before applying the knives, you must drill holes around it with what are called 'non-penetrating drills', for they do not go beyond the surface of the flesh that covers the bone; because a drill bit has a rounded tip resembling a margin, and its small diameter prevents it from penetrating or going through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	You will need to have many of these drills at hand, each one suited to the thickness of the bone, until you have a complete set for every skull; and their sharp ends should be long or short according to the thickness of that particular skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of terrors, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of drilling around a fractured bone is as follows: you place the trepan over the bone and move it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then exchange the trepan to another place and place what is between every hole and the amount of the thickness of the radius, or about that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then incise with the incision tool what is between every hole from the bone and make it thinner than you can from the fine end of light, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either by hand or with another instrument which you have prepared for that purpose, such as pliers or thin saws.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to be careful not to touch the trepan or the incision tool with anything from the siphon.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have gone around the bone with drilling and it has been separated from the siphon, if it is still connected to it, and you have extracted it, you must smooth and even the end of it that remains in the bone with another similar incision tool.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it must be thin and subtle more than other incision tools.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there remains anything of small bones and flesh, take it with ease, using what instruments you have at hand.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then, treat the wound after that with liniments and ointments as we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, entirely distant from fear: as Galen said and praised it with great praise; and this is the essence of his words.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	You must first begin to remove the bone portion from the place where the fracture is more severe and obvious; until you detect that portion and place under it the tip of this lens knife, whose form is thus.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens portion does not cut anything when it is soft; and its sharp edge penetrates both sides in length, as you see: so that the lens portion is inserted into the siphon with its sharp face cutting into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then, strike the knife from one side with a small mallet until you cut through the bone easily, as required; and be careful from the fear that nothing happens to you.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician is not more foolish than other men and less ignorant of it, and if he were not sleeping, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it off with the tip of this lens knife itself and free it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is indeed freed from him without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate through to the skin, and what is detached from the bone is its face, and there remain in it roughnesses and subtle inflammations: then you should smooth that roughness and root out those inflammations with very fine scissors from which you have prepared a number of different quantities, so that it is possible for you to apply to every place what is most suitable among them, and most correct according to the operation to which it leads, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you apply your scissors in proportion to the width of their roots when you first radiate the bone.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use the finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity until you reach the point of administering the thinnest and most subtle among all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In any remaining fine cracks or subtle fractures, you should apply care according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter that should not be hidden over all, to anyone who has any study in this art, and he stands firm on what we have written and demonstrated regarding great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, the skin is detected and retained when you remove the bone: then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth, making it as comfortable as possible so that it does not cause pain.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply a wide bandage over it, but do not tighten it unless necessary to hold the wound together; and leave it with this care for one or two days until you are free from fever's attack.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it and apply the medicines needed to relieve excessive dryness, such as lily roots, herb flour, turd alder powder, aristolochiac, and similar ones; and make from these medicines a powder that will be applied over the wound like dried up material.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply in that all medicines of the kind whose property is to cleanse, and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And be careful according to your ability that the wound is clean under your care; let there be no filth or stench of ointment on it.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Do not let any pus form on it at all, because when pus forms on the skin of the brain, it corrupts and putrefies it, and brings great harm after that; and this has already happened to a patient's head when the bone is cleaned from it, especially if its care is neglected, resulting in blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider then if an accident happens to a patient with the injuries we have described, know that it is most certainly harmful and should be avoided at all costs.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	If blackening does not occur, except through the medicine placed on it, and is due to the power of that medicine, causing such blackening; then you should take one part honey, three parts rose oil, and a cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place the patient on the bed; afterward, care for the injury with suitable remedies until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	§ On the restoration of our body when it is fractured.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not broken except at both its upper parts simultaneously, or at one of them; for they are two bones, and since the lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break but is subject to friction, torsion, and curvature only.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts of the nose is broken, then you should insert your index finger and little finger into the nasal hole from the outside, and equalize the fracture with them until the nose returns to its natural shape; and this should be done skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And moreover, so as not to cause that pain to the patient during your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If there is a fracture in the upper part of the nose and it cannot be reached with the fingers, then it is necessary to adjust the end of the radius where there is a small amount of thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed there is a fracture in two parts, then do it like this: and when the restoration of its strength is possible on the first day of the fracture.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at rest, near the warmth of the patient.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a thread made of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two threads if the fracture is in two parts, and let the thread have such thickness as fills the nostril hole.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some ancient healers say that thread should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That does not seem right to me; rather, it is necessary for the thread to be soaked in a paste made of chalk and ground flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the thread until the bone hardens and the cartilage becomes firm.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes when a quill from the beak of a goose is introduced into the nose where it has become embedded in the soft flesh, it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly and prevents the patient from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not a necessary thing.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that; and if you wish, do the opposite.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If, while operating on the nose to remove a abscess, it becomes infected again, apply a warm poultice with butter, or with wool soaked in rose oil, or a little of the decoction.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	However, if there is no infected abscess, then it is necessary to apply a poultice with sesame flour and powder made from wolfsbane and alum.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft pad over it and do not tie the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are indeed broken or crushed, then you should split them and extract the pieces with the instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then use the proper scalpel and take care of it so that it does not become infected, and strengthen it with suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs between the nose and cheek, then it is necessary to treat it with liniments and apply a lead cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, notice whether the break is only from the outside and not into two pieces, then it can be treated internally; its recognition is then easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if there is a fracture on the right side of it, insert your left index finger into the lower left jaw; similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, then insert the right hand's index finger; and with it, push the deformity of the fracture inward easily towards the exterior with your other hand from the inner part of the bone, making it equal.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the lower jaw is already broken into two pieces, then it is necessary to apply external pressure to both parts according to their position until it is possible to equalize them.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	However, if it has already happened that the teeth have become disturbed or broken: then tie them together from which you hope will remain using gold, silver, or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a piece of cloth over the fractured mandible.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Next, place a doubled cloth over it, and then lay a large, well-made pad on top; or a piece of skin from the sole of the foot, equal in length to the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it firmly from above, according to the preparation of its ligature, and its application should continue until it is no longer effective; and especially instruct the patient to rest and be calm, and give him soft food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	However, if you think that any change in the shape has occurred in any way, then remove it and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten what has been altered from it, and apply a paste made from flour ground from ash or sesame seed, after you have removed the cloth; and place a soft woolen cloth over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	So long as that plaster remains attached and the arrangement of the bones is not altered, do not dissolve it, until it heals; or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often tightened for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, an abscess forms during that time, then apply the treatments we have mentioned many times for its relief, until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if there is a fracture with a wound, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	If a fragment is detached from the bone, either a small piece or a large one: then use your skill in this, to remove those fragments of the large piece with the instruments at your disposal.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If the wound opening is narrow, then widen it with a phlebotom according to the amount needed by you.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed the fragments and nothing remains of them, clean the wound if it is wide, and if not, place on it a plaster suitable for that purpose, and keep it covered until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	§ On the restoration of the furculas (forks) when they break.
Caput VI.	Head VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the fork is most often broken from its front part near the humerus, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it may break and separate into two parts, other than the occurrence of fractures within them, which makes their restoration easier.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or, on the other hand, if they occur within the bone, their restoration is more difficult.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Thus, as in a fracture with an open wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in such a case when there is no open wound, is that you should have two assistants, one holding the fractured bone in place, and the other extending the neck towards the affected part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture with your fingers, until its shape is as it should be, and there should be neither a prominence nor a cavity.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then you should place a small round sphere made of cloth or wool under the bone, and adjust its size according to your needs, and extend and elevate the fractured part with your hand, until the fracture is equalized as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot draw the end of the bone towards the exterior because it has reached a deep point, then the patient should lie on their side, and place a medium-sized pebble under their shoulder, and have an assistant press down on their arm until the opening of the fracture moves up towards the top, and then straighten the fracture and equalize it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If, however, you feel a stagnation from the fracture, and it moves, then you should find a way above it and extract the stuck part with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then use a knife prepared in advance to make an incision into it, after placing under the fork the instrument that will preserve safety; and the instrument is of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a snail shell without any curvature.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to the need, considering the size of the bone and its thickness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	However, its length should also be according to what is possible for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two ends, as you can see: one end is wide, and the other is narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the fracture of the bone that you made while removing the foreign body is wide, and you are secure from further damage by heat, then sew together two edges of the wound with a stitch.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the fracture is small, or there is no risk of further heat damage, then fill the wound with cloth and small pieces according to the amount of the wound's incision.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If there is a risk of heat damage, then dip the cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The true stiffness of bone when it is without a fracture or incision is like placing over the bone a plaster made from flour and chalk.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft padding over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its protrusion, if necessary.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a bandage, that is, the long cloth that the Saracens use, which should be about one palm width or slightly more.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a double strand over the padding and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a small wooden frame whose width is three fingers, and length the same.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the frame in place over the fracture and where it is needed.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the bandage over the fracture as desired, and wrap it around the neck, both over and under the protrusion, and under the healthy and weak parts, drawing it across all parts, so that you see the stiffness holding the fracture firmly, and that nothing conceals itself over your sight, or moves the frame from the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, you must examine the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever the ligament softens, and you see the fracture beginning to move, then correct it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient to sleep on their back and put a pillow under their hip near their sleeping position, so that when they turn, help is provided from their own side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Thus the fracture of the fork (bone) will be healed through the elevation of the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind the arm to the collarbone: and do not loosen the ligament unless an accident occurs from itching or detachment, until after twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the dressing if you see its face towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the compression, and leave it until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed, the fracture of the fork (bone) is tightened and comforted for the most part within twenty-eight days; and it happens in some people in a shorter time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	## On the Restoration of the Fork Fracture.
Caput VII.	Head VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The spatula rarely breaks, and if it does, it is only at its wide end, and not from the rest of it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When, therefore, it does break from that place and breaks in the middle of it, and is not known except by touch; then, according to the form of the fracture, attempt its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it according to the natural form of every possible skill to you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place a fine grinding powder with alum and a soft pad, and put over it a small piece of doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place on it a wide lattice of thin board according to the quantity of the spatula, or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed there is hollow under the lattice in some parts of the spatula, then equalize that hollow with the soft pad until the lattice descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then tie it above with long string, tightening it, and the firmness of the lattice, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the tie every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the ligament softens, tighten it, and if it is removed from its place, it should lie on its healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula will be restored in twenty days, or in forty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is complete, then loosen the ligament; and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is made from bones whose union is not to be feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If, however, it proceeds from a fragment of bone that pierces under the skin, then cut above it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we said regarding the fracture of the fork from the heat of a fever, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	**On the restoration of a fractured chest.**
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes fractures in the middle of itself, and it rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities break most often, and become crushed from their accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle part of his leg is broken, which bends downwards, and he experiences excruciating pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and perhaps spits out blood, and the fracture becomes apparent to the senses, it should be restored so that the patient can lie on his back, and place a poultice between his legs.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders and bring the ribs together from both parts or sides with the hands, gently adjusting it into equilibrium as much as possible until the bone structure returns to its natural form.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then apply a plaster and compress over it, placing a thin wooden splint made of willow or similar light wood on top, after which you cover it with a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then gently wrap it around the fractured bone to prevent movement, and apply the bandage according to its curvature towards the back several times, tightening it firmly but not excessively.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then regularly check the bandage and tighten it whenever it loosens. If it needs to be adjusted due to itching, or corrosion at the site, or pain, or swelling, then remove it, loosen the bandage, and correct any issues that have arisen during the healing process.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then remove the plaster if it no longer serves its purpose, and attach a new bandage until healing is complete.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the Restoration of the Ribs When They Are Broken
Caput IX.	**Chapter IX**
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the thick places which follow the spine, and from their ends towards the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they do not suffer friction unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from sense when examined with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done so that the fracture is equal with fingers according to possible manner, until it acquires form, as it should.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters, and tighten the broken bone with strings if it is needed.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined towards the inner parts, then it causes a severe pain, and a piercing, as the one that happens to him who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also he suffers difficulty in breathing, coughing, and spitting blood: and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients have already devised many remedies for it with their ingenuity: and among them are those who say that you should give the patient food that generates inflammation and ventilation, so as to inflame the belly, cause it to swell, and push the fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	Indeed, let us avoid it so that no hasty cause arises to make a hot abscess if it is not necessary.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	However, if it has already happened, then he should apply to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: Let a flowing thing be placed over the place, then it should be sucked with force, and it is more in line with reason.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, they fear that the flowing thing may attract excess to the place due to the weakness of its disposition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: It is necessary that the place be coopered with wool that has already been immersed in hot oil: and they should put small pieces between the ribs until it is filled, so that there is an equal ligature when the wound is closed according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person should be cured with pleurisy treatment from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the sick person is in such pain that he cannot bear it, and the bone hurts the wound puncturing it, and we fear for the sick person, then we should cut above the place, and detach the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we should place an instrument that preserves the healing on it, whose remembrance came before: and we should cut the bone with ease, and cut through itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we will close the two edges of the wound if it is large and requires stitching. We will treat it with bandages until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If, meanwhile, a hot abscess forms, then apply it with appropriate remedies and insert small pieces of rose-scented oil into it, and place it over the affected area; the patient will be cured by what is suitable for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	In the meantime, it is also necessary to turn over the patient on their side where they sleep until they are healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	§ On the restoration of fractured spine and neck bones.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, the bones of the neck sometimes suffer a fracture and rarely do they experience friction; likewise, the spine bones.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When such a thing happens to someone, and you want to know whether they will heal or not, then consider (and reflect).
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see that his hand has become soft, and weak, and dead; and he cannot move it, nor stretch it, nor contract it; and when you press it with your fingers or prick it with a point, he feels nothing and experiences no pain, then know that he will not heal, and is in a mortal condition in many ways.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If, when moved, they feel a tightness with the fingers and a point, then know that the concave part of the bone is healthy, and that the patient will be cured with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If it affects the spine in a similar way, and you want to know if it will heal, or not, then consider its feet. If you see that they have softened, and this occurs in them as it does in the hands, then when it lies on its back, a lack of strength and weakness emerge without volition, and when it turns over onto its side, weakness emerges without volition, and when it turns over onto its back again, and wants to urinate, but cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not despair in its treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing of that happens to it, then the condition is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what happens from that is, as if you are removing the heat of a fever: so, as you place only rose-colored oil on the affected spine, or when the swelling has subsided with enough probing.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Apply this several times a day until the heat of the fever subsides. Then place over the affected area one of the comforting, draining, and binding plasters, and tighten it with a bandage, and especially instruct the patient to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	He should not sleep over the part where he feels pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If this happens near the attrition of a bone that is fractured, or anything that has already become separated from it: then it is necessary to cut through the skin and remove that part.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then close the two edges of the wound with stitches if it is large.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with something incarnate, from ointments, until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the last bone of a finger is broken and there is no movement: then it is necessary to insert your left hand's thumb into the joint, and with your other hand, try to align the broken bone as best as possible.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place something over it and remove the protruding part: and treat the wound with the cure that came before until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	# Restoring the Anca (Hip Joint)
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the anca (hip) rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then their fracture is not, unless there is a comminution at the extremities; and they split along their length and bend towards the interior. This causes pain in the affected area and bruising, and the leg that breaks becomes stunned.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is that you should extend your hand over it until you rest on the fracture as it is depicted.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at the extremities of it, then equalize that fracture according to what is prepared for you from equality, until its natural shape is assimilated.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is along its length, or it has already bent towards the interior, then make the afflicted lie down on his side until a restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have equalized it, place a plaster over it, then place a splint over it made of wood or skin, and tie it tightly so that you do not fear any change in the fracture, nor removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And it should have an equal tension with that which fills it, until the binding takes hold according to equality; and especially instruct the afflicted one to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if a hot apth should occur to him: then cease from stretching it and its restoration until the hot apth is seated; and place over it what sits on it as it was before, then return to its restoration, and tie it tightly as it should be.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If a fracture or severe crack occurs in the bone, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	**On the Restoration of Fractures (by the Lord)**
Caput XII.	**Head - Chapter XII**
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The aid (or support) is that which is between the elbow and the tip of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it is fractured, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of these methods is: take a flat wood of medium thickness, according to this form that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligaments are tied at both extremes.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then, it is suspended from the elevated position, and the injured person sits on the support.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then, he extends his broken arm over the wood until it reaches the point (or edge) where a thickness of the wood is attached to it.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then, he hangs something heavy from above so that the injured person extends their body towards the lower part (or bed).
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the surgeon should apply his hands to the fracture and adjust it until it is healed as it should be.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	There is another method to help the patient lie on his back and suspend his hand from his neck with a ligature.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants to hold one of them above the fracture with his hands and the other below it, extending each towards their respective sides.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish for a stronger extension, then tighten the ligature below the fracture and another above it with different ligatures; each assistant should extend towards their respective parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is near the end of the humerus, then a ligature should be placed under the tendon and another under the fracture towards the cubit.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly, if the fracture is near the cubit, then a ligature should be placed over that area and also above the same cubit.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equalize the fracture with ease without strain until it is healed as it should be and applied properly; then tighten it if there is no risk of heat or fever.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If there does happen to be a hot fever, then allow the tightening until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place over it a cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the wound rests; then tighten it, and the manner of tightening it is to place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then apply a new cloth overlay on the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then gather the arm over the aid itself, and place his open hand upon his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and tighten it over the aid of the arm, so that the arm remains in place like the stars: if nothing prevents you from doing so, and nothing alters upon you from the fractured bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If, however, anything alters upon you from the fractured bone, then use a splint: and it is as if you place over the fracture itself an asterisk which is wider and stronger than the rest of the stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every asterisk the width of a finger: and the length of the asterisks according to the fracture, with an addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten over the asterisks the binding as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is so that your binding be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more a fracture is elongated, the less will be the contraction.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the position of the stars and the contraction, as we have said, at the hour when you restore the member immediately, then do this: and if you fear a hot apostema, then release the contraction and the stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament in all three days, so that there is no itching, or swelling, or hindrance to food reaching the member due to the contraction's position.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore correct that whole thing according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you are very confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not release the ligament, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient lie on his back with his hand on his stomach; and place under him a pillow full of equal wool.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day, so that the form of the fractured member does not open up, or the ligament soften.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore correct that whole thing with your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And then place food for the patient according to the order we have mentioned, so that the food is subtle at first, until the mouth begins to tighten; then it is necessary to make the food more substantial.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the custom of the aid and the bandage is to tighten for forty days; therefore, it is necessary to loosen it and administer a bath, and treat it with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is severe and inflamed, then do not release it from the bandage and do not remove the splints until fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	**On the Restoration of a Fractured Arm**
Caput XIII.	**Head XIII.**
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two forearm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is smaller: and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is larger, and it is that which is placed under the smaller one from below.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Therefore, perhaps only the larger bone breaks, or the smaller one; and perhaps they break at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the upper lobe of the lung is pierced, its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower lobe of the lung is pierced, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones are broken at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is fractured is the upper lobe of the lung, then it is fitting for the physician to aid in its restoration by placing an extension on the lung with ease, until it recovers.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed the large lobe is the one that is broken: then it is necessary to apply a stronger compression vigorously.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to apply the hand's form during its restoration, and also extend it stretched over the lung.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the other fingers; and the joints lower than all the other fingers, or any remaining ones: and the quadrate muscle sitting below itself, and the lung in front of it, or directly before it, at a height where it does not incur infirmity.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the assistant should extend the arm from its lower part, or with their hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant should extend it similarly above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the surgeon should adjust the bone, until it reduces to a form more favorable than before.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are jagged edges in the fracture of a bone, then try to reduce every fragment to its place with your own strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed it appears that a jagged edge has separated and pierces the skin, and you have no hope of restoring it: then find above it, and remove it according to the manner we have mentioned regarding those described previously.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	However, if the fracture is with a wound, I have already dealt with that particular chapter, so take care of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If, during the beginning of your restoration, a fever occurs, then apply a cloth with a mixture made from red ochre, white wax, and a medium between thickness and thinness: tighten the cloth over it with a delicate tension, until the swelling subsides; then remove the ochre mixture, and apply a prepared plaster from meal ground with egg whites.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place bands, and let the band placed over the fracture be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of bands used varies according to most arrangements: either there is a fracture in one small bone, or in two simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Next, place your bandage over the stronger and more firm part of the fracture, and a little higher or lower than the middle of the fractured bone: or, if you prefer, place a softer bandage around it for a short while, as mentioned earlier at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, not hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And the thread used for binding should be made of linen, of medium thickness between fine and coarse, as we have mentioned.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and the ligature after a few days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens that requires rectification, such as a itching in the member: then it is necessary to immerse the member in warm water until the itching subsides, and release the tight bandage until it has healed, then continue with the binding.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage has already become soft and the bone has already been removed, and similar things have happened: then rectify it all with your strength, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the member due to excessive bandaging, then it is necessary to soften the bandage a little for some time and release it for a few days until the flow of nourishment resumes, then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If nothing from what we have said affects the patient, then it is not necessary to solve it until after twenty days or so.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the patient should be suspended over his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And his neck should be equal [in position], and guarded by its own strength from restless movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture will heal in thirty days, or perhaps in thirty-two days, and possibly in eighteen days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this is according to the arrangements of the humors and the dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	**On the Healing of Fractures of the Hand**
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that it rarely happens that the fracture is of the tendons of the hand or the joints of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him unless there has been friction many times.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When, therefore, there occurs a fracture or dislocation of a bone, the patient should be made to lie in a recumbent position, and a seat should be placed before him in accordance with his condition.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on it, extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant should extend the broken bones and adjust them until they are healed properly.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary for him to apply a plaster and poultice, unless there is a risk of fever.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the bandage on top of it according to the amount of space required, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	However, if the fracture is around the lower part of the foot, then make a ball-like shape from cloth and especially instruct the patient to wrap it tightly with his fractured foot, then secure it with a long piece of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And the bandage should be made from leather, which is soft so that it adheres to the skin of the foot, and tighten it as needed.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	However, if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary to place a bandage above and another below the foot, and the hand should be straightened.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then he applies a bandage as required by the hand, and extends it between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If any of the joints of the fingers should fracture, then if it is the thumb, it should be set according as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it is bound with the sole: and if there be a swelling, put to it a straight, firm splint: so that the fracture may be relieved, and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If, however, the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, index, ring, or little finger, then it should be set and bound with the healthy finger that follows it; or all may be bound together according to their sequence, which is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put over it a firm splint as we said regarding the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after that arrangement of the bandage warm, and apply to it what is necessary, when something happens from it, according to its course of healing.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	## On the Restoration of Hip Fractures.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often broken, and this condition is characterized by sensory impairment because it turns towards the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is such that one ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient is laid out on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then all the assisting ligaments should be extended towards their respective parts according to equality; and this is done when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	However, if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then the ligament should be adjusted to the iliac region so that the extension goes upwards, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And likewise, if there is a fracture near the knee, then the ligament close to the knee should be adjusted so that the extension goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the surgeon should adjust the bone with both hands until it is reduced according to the natural shape, and the bone is joined with a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage if there is no displacement of the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If there is such a displacement: then leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides in the dislocated member, after which you can resume your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The structure of this condition should be such.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to cover the fracture with a bandage, that is, tie it tightly; and make two or three folds in it, and leave an excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then cover the leg with the bandage until it reaches the heel near the root of the toes.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee towards the lower parts, so that the ends of the thread come out from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap around the leg and thigh what excess is left from the previous wrapping.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the thigh at the location of the fracture small sticks, and make from them one stick that rests on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the space between the leg and thigh with soft cloth to achieve tension.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong tension from the middle of the fracture site using three or four folds (of the bandage).
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more it is elongated with the ligament from the fracture site, the less and softer your tension will be, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then turn your attention to the two ends of the thread, which you have inserted between the hip and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore, tie them together with each of the three threads that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then insert the two ends of the thread into the lower parts until you reach the foot's root.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And tie both threads tightly, at the other ends of the stars, so that the ligature does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then leave the ligature over that, as long as it remains, so that there is no corruption, ulceration, or swelling in the member, or anything similar.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something of that happens.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, with the removal of the ligature, straighten that which has occurred from it, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed there is a fragment of bone that pierces the bone, then you should do the same to it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find an alternative and remove that, and take care of it as you have remembered about the previous one until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is so severe that stars are added to it, as we said in the aid and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in restoring it in this way, no lame weakness occurs to the patient.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, except that another crutch is applied to it, then it is necessary for him who has it, to always walk with a limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip becomes stiff in fifty days, or is added or reduced a little: all of this depends on the diversity of complexions and the disposition of the rest.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	**On the restoration of a fracture of the knee-joint.**
Caput XVI.	Head XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that the fracture of the knee-joint rarely occurs, but it experiences friction many times.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed a fracture does occur, then it is either a crack or an opening in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands over that with all its senses.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that it replaces what has been broken from its parts with the fingers, until it is aggregated and joined again as much as possible in terms of equality and ease, and by means of construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then apply a plaster made of sesame flour or from the mill, with egg white: and place over it a round shield, if necessary: and tighten a suitable strain above it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements that we have mentioned in the other fractures, such as an infected ulcer and similar ones: so that you oppose every occurrence with what is appropriate to it until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	## On the Restoration of a Fractured Hipbone.
Caput XVII.	**Chapter XVII.**
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the hips are two bones, of which one is thick and is called the hipbone, and the other is thin and is called the femur.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And both species of fracture happen to the two bones of the arm: and because of this, its restoration is done like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is the same.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones are broken at the same time, the crushed crossbone extends to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the delicate bone is broken, the crushed crossbone extends to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thick bone is broken, you will find it below, and among them are those that will not be hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then apply the extension, equality, and binding of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the crossbone is a severe one with many pieces, then the extension should be smaller and your healing should be gentler.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And indeed, in the crossbone there is something like a limb from operation, and it is as when you equalize the stars and complete all your work, then take two strips of pine wood, which are used in making solar panels that are placed under tables, and they are made from palm leaf spatulas. Choose ones with a small thickness, not very thin, and their length should be according to the length of the crossbone from the knee down below.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each cloth with two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the crossbone from one side, and the other part from the other side, and they should be from the knee down to the foot below.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind two fasciae at three places from both ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when the tightness is prohibited, the cruciform tendrils bend to the right and left, and stand firmly in place.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed, a cradle should be made of wood according to the length of the leg, and the leg placed within it so that it is preserved from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed, it is most important that you do this in the fracture when there is a wound proper to it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and apply to it the same care and attention from separation, or swelling, or any other cause.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	So if something happens from those things, then apply to it what is necessary until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On fractures of the bones of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture of the calcaneus does not occur completely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot indeed suffer fracture, and sometimes the toes also; and they do not suffer fracture unless there is friction in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs and you see these bones rising above each other again, then the patient should put his foot on the prepared ground as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand up and place your foot on whatever raises these bones; then press or step on it; and keep doing so until it returns to its original position.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a plaster and remove the splint; and place under the foot a thin board with two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it tightly to the foot with a bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloth and other things it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When they have passed three or four days, then untie the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For when you find the bones equalized, or fractured, or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Therefore, the operation on them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If, however, some fingers are broken, then restore them, and equalize them according to what I have told you in restoring the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger in a splint according to the length of the finger, and make it slightly wider; then place this board under the foot as I have told you, and tie it tightly.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed what is broken consists of two, three, or more bones, then place over every finger a pad of its own size, wrapped in linen cloth, and fasten the board to the sole of the foot; let it stand on one end of the board's head outside the foot's vein, so as to maintain good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it will be for you to remember that you do not overlook but consider everything I told you about the other fractures from accidents we mentioned, and oppose every accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	§ On the fracture of the vulva of a woman, and the ribs of a man, and the penis of a man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is broken, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her slightly towards the back part of her own body, and hold her from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife should fill her vulva with cotton until it is full, and let it be as a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman should be moved, and she should raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	That bone emerges from its socket until it becomes round like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns to its original state.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a small piece of cloth over it.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When it is time to release the pressure, remove the bandage gently, then drain; and return it to its original position as you first inserted it, and then return to its own little piece.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	It should be done for seven days or so, as the bone itself restores itself.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a warm cloth, and place a tube of reed over the opening, and insert the whole cloth into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force until the cloth is stretched inside her vulva; for indeed, the fracture will heal itself.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it is bandaged and left for several days, as we have described, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the breastbone of a man or woman is fractured, then apply for its restoration, and use the same thing that we have described for the bone of Achilles.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in these close fractures that occur rarely, especially for those who are engaged in study or practice.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for the fracture itself indicates to you, in many dispositions, the right way to restore it and its tightness: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the bone of man breaks, take the neck of a goose and insert the staff into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place a bandage over it from cloth, and it is bandaged, and released after three days, or around those days, and it will be healed, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	# On the restoration of bone fractures when they are with a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is necessary for him who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone or any helper, or similar ones, to seek help immediately, and phlebotomists should be called upon at once: if you are certain of the conditions of phlebotomy, as we have instructed.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound bleeds, then it is necessary to seek help to cut it off, so that dust and debris are removed from it; if you do not have another phlebotomist available.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day; and do not postpone it unless an apothema occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed an apothema occurs with a fever, then allow the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the apothema is seated.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause him to suffer a bad complication.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	However, if the fractured bone is prominent above the skin: then it is necessary to reduce it by pressing it down with your hand, and equalize it with a little ease and extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	However, if no extension is prepared, and the equalization with your hand is not possible: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the size of seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of this, the doctor needs to take from them three or four, according to the amount needed for that treatment in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be round: and it should have a little thickness, so that it is not doubled up at the pressure upon it during the operation: and its ends should be sharp, with a margin at their ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And it should be above its thickness from the middle to its lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, it is necessary to place the sharp end of the curette over the prominent end of the bone, and push it with a single stroke until the bone returns to its original position and is aligned.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, strive to equalize the ends of the fracture anew.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its ends are broken delicately and do not accept the instrument well, then it is necessary to cut away the end of that bone until the instrument has a firm grip on it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce them at all with what we have mentioned, then cut it with what is appropriate from the scissors that we have spoken of; or saw it with any saw that is possible for you to use.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then smooth the remaining part of the bone that is left from its roughness and fine layers of cortex.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone is reduced and finds itself weak after its reduction, causing a persistent severe pain, then you know that the bone has not returned to its original position.
Fac ergo illud.	Therefore, do that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great power to the sick when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in black astringent wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And use it properly if it is suitable for summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place anything on the wound that is green or contains oil, so as not to cause putrefaction and corruption within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the stars at the hour of completing your bone restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound exposed: so that you may drill with the forceps a hole into the infections according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take every care not to tighten the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many times these stupid doctors have done this, and they have caused their patients to suffer from putrefaction, or death, or corruption, or gangrene, that is, loss of blood.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your tightness be soft, flexible, different from the tightesses of the other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad or it is a large wound, and some bad event has occurred to it as we have described, and you find pain at the suspended site, then it is not necessary to place stars over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make incisions over the hard pans at the sites of the stars, and tighten it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	However, if it is after one or two days and you see that the wound has begun to form pus, then remove the hard pan that you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply poultices and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the four-ingredient ointment and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is appropriate for you to loosen the ligature.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day in the morning and evening until it hardens and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary to prepare the member such that pus can drain from it easily downward.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If several days pass and the wound does not harden or drain pus from it, then know that there are severely damaged bones there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why it is necessary that you should inquire about a wound with care.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	Indeed, from those which are separated, remove them and extract the foreign body itself.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those which are not separated from them and pierce the member, causing pain, try to cut them off, and remove them in any way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If a wound becomes infected or gangrenous, or undergoes other forms of corruption and putrefaction, then you should treat each of these as it requires in the treatment that is appropriate to it, as discussed in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And regarding what I have said above, and when you must use your own judgment in a situation where the tongue is broken and protrudes from the member, such as the thigh bone, or other bones of similar size, do not attempt to remove it until it has begun to rot, for indeed death often follows from such injuries, so leave it alone until putrefaction sets in.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall off on its own after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	So then care for the wound if it appears to you, and otherwise, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of a nodule at the site of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	**Chapter XXI**
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This nodule often occurs at the site of healing a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially when it occurs near joints, and it disfigures the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the member from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, if the nodule is recent, apply to it drugs that have a drying effect, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, dragon's blood, acacia, and similar substances.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So, take some of these, or all of them, and mix them with astringent wine, or with albumin from eggs, or with vinegar, and place them over the nodule in a poultice, and bind them tightly to the affected area.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the poultice on, not loosening it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another one, until the nodule is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Grip the blade firmly over the entire plate of lead correctly.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead, indeed, is the property that removes all that is feared from the body.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	However, if the swelling has already turned into a lump and it is tight, and urgency necessitates its removal: then find a point on top of it from its upper part, and cut off the protruding excess until it is removed; or rasp it with certain rasps until it is removed, and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	§ On the healing process: when restoration occurs, and a member remains delicate after that contrary to its natural state.
Caput XXII.	Head XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored and the member remains delicate after that, weak; then it does not become strong unless for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of these is that the abundance of ligament solution and its binding is not according to what is necessary; or due to excess tightness of the ligaments' binding until nutrition is blocked from reaching the member; or due to excessive embrocation at an inappropriate time; or due to lack of blood in a weak body, and its debilitation.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment for it is to feed the weak, and make its body tender until blood multiplies in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer the bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place a poultice on the member: so that it attracts the leech to itself for much nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And continue to apply its frequent immersion in warm water until the nourishment flows and it recovers its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	§ On the healing of broken bones when they are restored tortuously.
Caput XXIII.	Head XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When a member, having been already restored after its healing, exhibits tortuosity or eminence of the broken bone or deformity; and it is thereby disfigured, yet does not hinder its natural function, then it is not necessary to receive again its advice, which imagines that the member will break again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And indeed there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed reprehensible, leading to death or a great fear, so that it becomes mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	If the weakness and swelling are recent, then it is necessary that he be bathed with warm water in which softening herbs are cooked, such as the leaves of the alder, and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made with a softening paste, such as a properly prepared poultice.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucilage of alder root, and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and apply it as a plaster.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or they may take plump figs, mixed with columbine clay and other similar medications that reduce hardening.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the swelling is relieved by persistent friction, old and gentle, which is done with damp hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And the movement of the limb should be applied to all parts at every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If, however, the deformity has already progressed and become strong, hardening into a stone, and intervention is needed to treat it with iron: then it is necessary to cut above it, and dissolve the continuity of the bone, and chip away what is superfluous from the swelling or bone with delicate chisels: and ease should be provided for it with caution and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On the discourse of dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	**Chapter XXIV**
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the departure of any joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is forbidden from its own motion, and the figure of the member is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes pain to the inferior part, and serious injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore any dislocation happens to anyone, then it is necessary to hasten towards its restoration; nor should it at all be delayed.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place is lost, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	For that reason, therefore, it is not necessary that it be moved, nor extended in the time of its apostasy.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it often causes spasms, and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	Indeed when that happens, then it is necessary that you should hasten to the bleeding of the wound.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	It is then released, until the ulceration rests.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	The member is then soaked with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	It is then reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And it heals every member when memory of it comes back to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocation, even according to what came before in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower parts.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	§ On the care of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Head XXXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely displaced unless struck very hard.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the jaws occurs according to one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are moved from their places with a sudden jerk, and become relaxed for a moment.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they become completely dislocated, until they relax towards the chest, until the swelling of the wound has subsided, and he cannot hold them, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is drawn out with talking.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When the dislocation is slight, it often reduces itself into several positions with a lack of much effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If it is a complete dislocation, then it must be reduced promptly and not delayed for long; it should hold the assistant by the head of the patient, and the surgeon should insert his index finger into the root of the mandible dislocation between the jaw and the mouth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or, if the dislocation is on both sides, he should insert both his index fingers at the same time.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And his remaining fingers should be outside, as he deems fit.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And specifically instruct the patient to clean his jaws and move them to all parts for chewing.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the surgeon should adjust the jaw and gently push it back to its place until it returns to its normal position.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are affected at the same time, then apply poultices with warm water and oil until it becomes easy to reduce them; do not delay the reduction of the jaws at all, as we said before.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they return and align, and the patient's mouth is closed, and they do not open, then place small pieces of cloth on them, with a paste made from beeswax; use rose oil as well.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it is bound with ease using soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	Then the patient should lie with his head elevated between two pillows, so that it does not move to the right or left, nor tries to chew anything; on the contrary, he should be given soft food, until such time as the pains subside and the jaw relaxes. Then he can eat what he wants, and do so without difficulty.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not exert himself over the operation of his mouth while eating, drinking, or speaking until the jaw relaxes and is healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of both jaws becomes difficult when they dislocate at some point and do not return to their places, then often fever and persistent vomiting occur; and perhaps the patient's belly is disrupted, and he vomits pure cholera.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	So if you see this happening, then know that it is a loss, and often he who experiences it dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	## Regarding the Reduction of Dislocated Furcula and Humeral Extremity
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The fork (ribcage) does not become displaced inward from its intrinsic lateral side due to its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	It (the rib) becomes displaced outward at times, and that is indicated by the sense of pain.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is for the patient to lie on their back and stretch out their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then, constrict the space with your hand using firm compression, for it will return on its own.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a plaster, and bandages over it, and tighten it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities following the cubitus, which continue with it, do not become displaced unless rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	Which, if it becomes displaced at some time: then it is necessary to bring it back and adjust it according to what we said, and what you have prepared.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a plaster, and bandages over it, and tighten it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And especially instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until they are healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the end of the humerus is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	**On the Reduction of Humeral Dislocation**
Caput XXVII.	**Chapter XXVII**
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus does not dislocate unless according to three modes.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of which one is that it dislocates towards the lower part of the soft tissue.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it dislocates towards the part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it dislocates towards the upper part of the humerus: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not dislocate towards the rear, because of the spatula-shaped bone.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not dislocate towards the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed, it dislocates and emerges most towards the lower part of the soft tissue: particularly in those whose flesh is scarce.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it quickly enters them and quickly exits.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	However, in those whose flesh is abundant, the opposite is true, that is, it exits with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men that they suffer a blow or a fall, and the humerus is displaced with heat, and it is thought that because of this it has already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that you experience this, until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And dislocation is known when it is towards the lower parts of the joint: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you notice a clear difference, and you perceive a concavity in the head of the humerus, and at the touch, the head of the humerus feels as if it is hollow: and the invalid cannot bring their hand back to their ear, nor move it with all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, then you will notice a clear sensation, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And this dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent, or if the patient is a weak child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is such that it raises the assistant's hand towards the higher parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under the patient's armpit and raise the joint with strength towards the upper part to its proper place; and the assistant will raise their hand and stretch it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he should place it lower, for indeed it returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If, however, it does not return as we said, and there have been many days since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and an application be made which softens and soothes, such as if roots of hemlock, fennel, and melilot were steeped in water and applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient should be turned over on their back, and under the armpit a ball and wool should be placed which is equal between relaxation and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should place their heel on the ball and raise the head of the humerus with strength, and pull the patient's hand towards the lower parts.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another assistant should hold the patient's head to prevent it from moving downwards: for indeed it returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you see fit, reduce it in this manner: and it is such that you make the present man who is longer than the patient, and stands on the side, and inserts his elbow under the armpit of the patient; and raises the armpit of the patient upwards until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another assistant pulls the injured hand towards the lower parts of his abdomen.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	However, if the patient is weak: then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him to weigh on it; for dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	It is also reduced according to another mode; and it is as if a long piece of wood were fastened to the ground, its head round like the handle of a mortar; which should not be too thick nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then soft cloths should be placed under the patient after they are laid on top of the wood, and the patient stands according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand is extended towards the lower part on the other side, and his body is stretched from the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this care: and it is as if you take a piece of wood whose length is the measure of two arms, and its breadth the measure of four fingers, and its thickness the measure of two fingers; which has a round head to facilitate its entry into the deep part.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are laid on the round head to prevent them from hurting the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Next, place it under the lower support so that the hand or arm can be extended over the wood until the lower parts are reached, and bind the wood over the helper and the arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm on top of the step ladder according to its width, and extend the hand downwards, and let the remaining body be suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The incision is immediately entered.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When, therefore, the entrance is completed in any way possible: then it is necessary to place under the support a ball of equal quantity made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Next, apply the prepared plaster from ground flour with olive oil and egg white over the whole arm as it is required above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten the support with a proper tension: and the binding is placed over the plaster above: and the hand is attached to its collarbone, and let go, so that the hand does not move for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to give a little food to the patient until the member is strengthened, for it is more expedient for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then after seven or five days, a larger one is put on and it is taken off with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it is healed and does not become worse, then it is already cured.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the joint is dislocated many times due to the moisture that has occurred or for another reason, then it should be treated with caustic with three holes, as described in the chapter on caustic.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all this is done, and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the joint is not confirmed, and the plaster and bandage are removed from it several times without becoming firm, and falls down and cannot be raised up to its original position; then you should know that the nerves attached to the shoulder blade have been cut, or stretched, or weakened; and you should know that the joint will never return to its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	In the case of a dislocation towards the chest and the nipple, or the reduction to the rear, it occurs with a blow and extension with the hands; until it returns, and the remaining bandage and care are applied, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If this happens after healing of the member, and there is a delay in its motion, then the patient should use the bath many times until that gravity becomes relaxed, and returns to its original natural state.

Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the cubitus becomes dislocated with difficulty, and similarly re-dislocates with difficulty; indeed, it dislocates to all parts, and particularly to the front or back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it falls under pressure and touch, according to any shape in which it becomes dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated cubitus with the healthy one, that becomes clearly evident.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The joint is then fixed, and the arm cannot be doubled or touched with its own humerus.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you approach and reduce the dislocation immediately, before it suffers heat from the delay.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it suffers heat from the delay, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it does not recover at all, especially when it affects the posterior parts.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	It is the worst of all types of dislocation, and brings with it more intense pain for them; and often descends with that death.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce them, is as follows: you extend your hand with both hands; the arm is expanded, and the doctor's hand is above the cubitus and under it, and he pushes the joint back using his thumb or the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	For indeed dislocation is to the front: then it returns so as to double the hand with its own hand, until it strikes the cubit that is dislocated with the root of its palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not obey and refuses to reduce, then apply a vigorous extension, a strong force: and it is as if both ministers extend the arm; and let them also hold it themselves so that it does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is revolved to every part after it has been extended above its hand with a doubled-over, long cloth or wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil so that it becomes one of those that aid the joint's lubrication with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should push the joint with a strong impulse until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be placed on it, in which there is stiffness and shrinkage with alum, and the tightness be adjusted appropriately.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be suspended from the patient's neck by a sling, and allow it to rest for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is removed.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the suture is made firm in its place, then loosen the ligature from it and release the same.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the suture is not tightly bound, then repeat the application of the plaster and ligature, and release it after a few days until it is tight.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	However, if there is a severe case after the reduction of the suture and the arrangement is in motion: then apply hydration in a bath, and gentle friction, and compression until it is lined, or place a warm compress over the ilia, that is, a pigeon's breast poultice.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is tied, and release it over it for the day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and immerse yourself in a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore it sweats, then gently friction the suture with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat over the ilia with the same compress once, twice, and three times upon entering the bath, until it is relaxed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you see, place a warm, moist, butter compress over it and tighten it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Perform that procedure several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It also relaxes and returns to its original position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	§ On the treatment of dislocation by Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Head XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Albucasis states that the hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint which connects the arm to the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that there be swiftness in the reduction of this dislocation at the moment it occurs, before the place shifts; otherwise, heat may set in and cause a deformity.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of this dislocation is such that you place the weakened hand of Albucasim on a table and have the assistant extend his hand; then the physician places his palm on top of the joint and pushes it until it returns to its place.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already receded towards the wrist: then the weakened person should place the back of his hand on the table beside the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation extends towards the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be inward over the table, that is, the inner part of his hand placed over the table so that the physician's hand may fall upon the very top of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, that is good; if not, then tighten the bandage around the wound to prevent further discharge, and release it after that so as not to repeat this process.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	But if it does not tolerate or you are unable to reduce it any further after a few days, yet the joint remains according to its own shape, and nothing harms the patient except that the hand becomes soft, and nothing can be tightened; then know that the nerves have been severed or frayed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore, there is no skill in it other than to tighten it with a dressing close to the wound.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not benefit from this.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When, therefore, Albucasis does not return, then place on it the plaster that we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is tightened and released after five days; afterward, it is loosened and released, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If, however, its movement is restricted and something serious happens to it, then loosen it with warm water and friction several times until it relaxes.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	**On the Healing of Dislocated Fingers.**
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from its joint, whether towards any part of the hand, or towards the back of the palm, or between its joints; then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns to its place.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the finger's head, and hang it towards the part where it is dislocated, and leave it thus for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang it up, and extend it until it becomes straight on that same day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	So, when night has fallen, bind it according to the aforementioned method; and do not cease to loosen it during the day; and exercise it with movement; and bind it again at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do likewise with it if it is dislocated towards the joint of the hand; bind it to that part, and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do likewise with it when it is dislocated towards other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	§ On the cure of spinal joint dislocation.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When someone suffers from a complete displacement of the spine or neck, or when many vertebrae are removed from their positions, then there is no cure for it, as death is approaching the patient.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the patient's weakness causes them to walk without willpower, and they cannot hold it: and often some of its members become weak from it, or both legs, or both arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Indeed, it often happens that it is removed so many times that it becomes detached from the four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, what is removed towards the back is called gibbosis.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment for it is to consider that if gibbosis occurs from childhood: then there is no cure for it, and there is absolutely no recovery from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	However, in cases occurring from accident, or impact, or similar events, the ancient methods of treatment have been discussed at length.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Most of which do not return with a beneficial outcome.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have indeed now shortened it from that which I had previously mentioned, of which little excuse is made for its proximity to me, in order to make my intention clear and to present the description and construction of its instrument in a different way from how it was shown and demonstrated.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore, I say that the curvature that occurs from the previous part is not a cause or cure.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly, the same applies to what is done regarding the two sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, unless what happens in the own back, as I will describe: and it is that the injured part extends its surface over an equal platform near the wall, and a moist cloth is spread beneath it, so as not to harm the chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight wooden board is placed fixed in the foul on the floor at the foot's end, approximately at its head, and another wood about its other foot's end; and the assistant should hold the board, and it should not be secured in the foul.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another assistant should hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then he should stretch over the head of the lower part, and beneath its tendons, a soft bandage, firm yet pliable; and extend the end of the ligament to the board that is near his head, and tie it to him.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tie another ligament above its edges, and above the knee of the same limb, and near its roots.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then join all the ligaments, and tie those threads to another wooden stick that is near its feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then stretch all the tools to the part of the ligament's wood, and do not remove the two woods from their places where they are fixed; however, they should not be secured as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place his palms on the spine with strength until it heals, or place a board over it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he attaches his feet over the board until it heals.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, it does not heal through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms' breadth.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And find the place in the wall as we said, which is near the weak point, where the end of the board will enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the doctor should place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And it should be tied well, until the spine is constrained, and it returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then, if necessary, perform the operation with a saw that is inserted with your hand: and it is as if you fix two pieces of wood to the ground near the patient's head on the final toe, whose length is the breadth of one arm; and near its head, two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And its length should be one palm between each piece of wood; and now a hole has been made everywhere through which the saw passes: and every piece of wood is firmly fixed to the ground so as not to move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And a round stick should be inserted; and the saw cuts through the ligament in two holes of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it, there is a hole where the stick is fixed, whose length is one palm with what it cuts; and similarly, in the other two pieces of wood, there is that same length.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then, tie the ligaments which you have tightened in the patient's chest with a saw that is near his head; and the ligaments which you have tightened on his legs with a saw that is near his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand beside each saw that is operating, turning your hand with the handle, as it turns; and the doctor adjusts the spine, according to what we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of a tourniquet that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, after the spine returns to its place and the site is equalized, you should then put a dried plaster with albumen on it.
Deinde stuppam.	Then apply the poultice.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterward, place above the plaster a star-shaped pad from wood, whose width is three fingers, or approximately that size.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length should be such that it takes up the place of the swelling and above the healthy part of the spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bound with the bandage that we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient should be given delicate food until they are healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If anything of prominence remains at the site after complete healing: then medicines that soften and soothe should be administered, along with the application of the board as we described in great detail during a prolonged period of time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now that lead sheet is administered in that place.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And whenever an eminence occurs at the very last of the spine, and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that bone already protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why should it not be that this medicine leads to her death instead of recovery? For perhaps it will indeed lead to her demise.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	**On the Treatment of a Dislocated Ankle**
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the joints of the ankle and the joints of the shoulder do not occur without a dislocation; nor do they suffer as other joints do from removal or compression.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	The ankle joint indeed dislocates in four directions.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	This is because it dislocates both forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And it is most often dislocated toward the inside; only slightly toward the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	The treatment for the dislocation toward the inside is as follows: because when you join the healthy leg to the injured one, it becomes longer; and the knee of the injured leg sticks out more than the healthy one, and the injured person cannot bend their foot at the groin; and there is a spot that follows the groin after the dislocation due to heat, because the hip joint has already reached that point.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of one who experiences a dislocation toward the outside is that it goes against these occurrences.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of one who experiences a dislocation toward the front is that it extends the healthy leg to its limit; however, it does not bend itself without pain in the knee; and if they attempt to walk, they cannot go beyond that point forward; and their urine becomes retained, their groin sticks out, and during walking, their foot steps on their heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of its occurrence in those who have dislocation towards the rear is that they cannot extend their leg or bend it twice before the hip doubles up; and his leg is also shorter on one side; and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is located at the ilium's place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation's types is such that you should consider then, if the dislocation is old and has already grown old with it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you apply the reduction and it remains according to its disposition, then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it is not necessary for a complete presumption to be made about her.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	However, in the case of a recent dislocation, which belongs to one of the four types of dislocations, then you should act accordingly, so as to restore the joint and stretch it both inwardly and outwardly, and move it with your right and left hand: perhaps it will return on its own, and no other treatment will be needed.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If, however, it does not return in this way, then you should prepare a strong assistant, and stretch his leg from the lower part; or with his hands, or with a ligature that is tied over his leg above the knee: and another assistant will extend his hand above, so as to insert his hands under his armpits.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he ties with a gentle ligature over the root of the thigh, and holds the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And its extension is either from the front part of the groin to the part of the fork, or from the back part to the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And all these extensions should be once, until the weak one is lifted from the ground with its body, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is the common kind among the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we said, it is good; but if not, then every kind of that which I say about its specific cure is necessary.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of it, indeed, when the dislocation is towards the inner parts, it is necessary that the weak one be turned back over its healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should place the ligature over the root of the thigh, at the point where it is between the head of the thigh and the space beneath the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then he extends the ligature upwards from the front part of the groin to the higher part of the body, towards the fork part.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another assistant should take a strong arm and reduce the large space of the weak hip joint, extending it to its external extension steadily.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For I return to my place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this is the easiest of the rest of the healing types, through which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	However, if it deviates from you and does not obey you in this type of healing at all, then it is necessary that both the weak feet be tied together with a strong, flexible ligament, over both calcaneuses and both knees; and each should have a length equal to the quantity of four fingers, and the infirm leg should be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the infirm one should be suspended over the head of the wooden beam, which is in the house; and its length from the ground should be equal to the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command the strong young one to strengthen the head of the hip joint; and hang another weak one with the strong; and push the other weak one, strengthening the hip joint with courage, for the connection returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In its return to its own place, when the dislocation is towards the outside, it is necessary that the weak one lies on a bed, as we described in the case of having a curvature.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And the ligament above its crucible, weak by nature, and above its chest be drawn.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two sticks are placed, one near its feet, and another near the head of the same.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a stick is placed in the middle of the foot, well fixed; over which wet cloths are laid so as not to hurt the weak part; and a stick should be placed between its thighs so that it is not drawn down towards the lower parts upon stretching.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then every assistant extends his/her own part, and the doctor adjusts the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it obeys the reversal, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place a board over it and press it equally as we said in the case of the hunchback.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the weak part lies over its healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary that the weak leg be quickly stretched; and according to this same account over the crucible; and the doctor should place his right hand's palm over the weak part's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then it ties itself with one hand and with that tie, it extends itself towards the lower parts and the portion of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the rear, then it should not be extended towards the lower parts and elevated above the ground; on the contrary, it should be placed over a hard surface, as is also the case when the dislocation is wide towards the exterior, according to what we said about its position on two surfaces. And the ligaments should be stretched over its face. As we recently mentioned.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And compression should be applied with a board over the place where the joint projects when it is reduced, as necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And you should not overlook the sign of its reduction: and it is as if you extend both legs of the injured person; and when you see that they are equal, and the injured person tightens his leg and extends himself without any hindrance, then you know that the member has returned as it should; then join the two thighs, put a plaster, and tie tightly with ropes, so that it does not move towards any part, and let the injured person rest quietly for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligament, the plaster, and compare the leg with the other; and if you see that they are equal in position, then know that the dislocation is now fixed. So release the injured person to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening (of a wound), then retreat (from direct contact) and apply a poultice to it, and bind it with your first tightness; and release it even after three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make it take its time in walking over each side for several days until it is well-healed.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	§ On the dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee joint can be dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwardly, inwardly, and downwardly, that is to say, posteriorly.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate toward the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that it causes the patient to bend his leg toward his chest.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not adhere with the thigh: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all three types of dislocation is to have the patient sit upright so that he can extend his leg if possible and adhere his back to your face; and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then attach yourself to his knee with your palms, and place them straight between your fingers on top of his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And have another assistant extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of return is that the foot adheres to the thigh gently, not forcibly.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply a poultice, and attach the foot to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with bandages for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the weak one must not walk for several days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, you cannot achieve its reduction, then administer a strong extension with the ligaments, of which the preceding narrative spoke regarding ankle cure, until it returns to its place.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	**On the Cure for Calf Dislocation.**
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus sometimes moves through a small removal, and sometimes it dislocates completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And the dislocation occurs either towards the interior or towards the exterior.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you will see the calcaneus inflated, proceeding towards the part it has dislocated from.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its removal is indeed easy: it should be extended with ease by the hands and adjusted until it returns to its place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	However, in the treatment when it dislocates completely, you should make the patient sit straight and have a strong assistant hold them firmly from the back, just below the middle of their back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold the foot with your right hand from its upper part and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the level of the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards yourself with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with your left hand, use two fingers.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then he extends with his left hand and pushes the foot's chest with his right hand, moving the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the foot's chest towards the leg in the third position, and pull out the cause.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns to the first position, or to both according to this manner, and you see the foot is even, it is good; but if not, then repeat the operation over it again: for itself it returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If, however, you are prevented from its return as we have said, then lay the sick person down on his back on the ground, and fix a very firm board in the earth between his thighs; and you have already covered him with a cloth so that it does not harm the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then the attendant should take hold of his thigh; afterwards, another attendant should stretch one foot, or with his hands, or with a bandage that he will bind around the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then every attendant should stretch against the stretching of his counterpart; and the board should stand between the two thighs of the sick person holding him so that his body is not drawn towards the lower part at the time of stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician should reduce the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant should hold the healthy leg at the lower parts.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	The dislocation returns with velocity.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When the dislocation returns and its restoration is declared sound, then apply a plaster and bandage, and firmly bind it with ligaments, and tie the foot with the ligament to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And you must be careful or afraid of the nerves that are above the heel in the rear, so that the ligament does not press on them and hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then allow it to rest for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament softens, tighten it; then release it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If indeed he tries to walk before that space is over, there will be no security but that the dislocation will dissolve and become worse, and it will not receive healing after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If a fever should come upon him, then you must administer to his sedative that of which we spoke earlier in another place regarding treatment, and apply broach until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the dislocation of the toes of the foot and its treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXX5.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what has been dislocated from them should be brought back into place with a slight extension without strain; and this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	However, if the dislocation is in some knots of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the afflicted person should make his foot rest on an equal place to the ground, or on a board: and he stands as if he were walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with force until it returns, and you perceive that it is now equal, and the prominence does not appear in place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under his foot a board which will take the whole foot, having two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten the same ligature for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is tightened and secured by reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the types of dislocation with the ulna or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens because of it and you attempt its treatment and restoration, death often follows: for that reason, one should not assume mastery over such treatment unless one is skilled in the art, merciful, pious, slow to act, not bold, nor presumptuous; and use only initial medicines that provide merely temporary relief from heat. And let the sick be released by divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you understand, or hope for salvation from destruction with the gentleness of illness, and where something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, try to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before the hot apostema occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the member returns to its previous state, according to our desire, then administer treatment to soothe the apostema: and care for the wound with what is appropriate from dried ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with fracture, and they occur in separated bones of the leg, then try to remove them, and do what we said regarding simple illnesses from what preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And because of your courage, and that you guard yourself from the entrance to the realm of fear: as I have previously told you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more beneficial to your body among them during your time.
