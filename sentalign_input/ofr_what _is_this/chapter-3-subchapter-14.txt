of the broken thigh
The thigh bone is often broken, and it is easily seen when it turns forward and back; and the treatment is to tie one bandage above the fracture, and another below.
And the patient lies on his face, then each assistant extends his bandage on his side equally; and this is when the break is in the middle of the bone.
And if the break is close to the hip joint, then one of the bandages should be towards the groin, and the other bandage below the fracture. 
And similarly if it is close to the knee, then the bandage should be near the knee, and the extension downwards; then the physician sets the bone straight with his two hands, until it is in its natural form, and then applies the plaster, and bandages it, unless a hot abscess develops there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside then return to your work and your treatment; the bandaging is done in this manner.
You must wrap a hard bandage, doubled in two or three, over the break, and leave the excess, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the base of the buttock, and put a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and the ends of the thread should come to the top; then turn the bandage over the leg and over the thigh, then place splints over the break, and place a splint over the leg bone; then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to evenly distribute the pressure, then begin to tightly tie three or four turns over the break; and the higher you go above the break, the less you tighten; then pull on the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and thigh, and tie the three splints that are on top, then go back down to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot; and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like that, as long as no abscess, swelling, or anything similar develops.
And if it does occur, untie it, and address what develops, as we have said many times; and if there are pieces of bone sticking out, they should be removed, if possible; and if not, then the area must be incised, and they must be pulled out; and treat it as we have described, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken in such a way that splints are applied, as in the shoulder and the arm; however, with the restoration done in this manner, the patient does not become lame.
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, depending on the differences in complexions.
