O you, very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine together with its completion, and I have made the end through its expositions and through its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of hands is neglected in our region and is completely estranged, the science is lost and broken, and nothing remains of it except the small descriptions in books of the ancients which the hands have changed. And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are closed and the science is alienated.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will bring together the forms of the cautery irons, and of the other instruments of the work with the addition of their declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good master of hands is found in our time, the art of medicine is prolonged. And it is necessary for him who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the judgment of the members, and their forms and conjunctions and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and veins and their number, and the movement and the moving and resting veins, and the place of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; and similarly in the art of the hand.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the things previously mentioned, let him beware lest he fall into error and kill men;
as I have seen many times many of those who meddle with this science and abandon themselves without science and without experience.
For I saw a foolish physician who cut an abscess of scrofula on the neck of a woman, and cut the arteries of the neck; because so much blood came out that the woman fell dead into his hands.
And I saw another physician who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; so he carried away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to treat him, and saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and knew that if it were cut, he would die.
And I saw another physician who took into his care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the fracture there was a wound;
and the physician, full of ignorance, pulled the fracture over the wound to the stars by strong force, and did not leave the wound any space, and left him in this state;
and commanded him that he should not unbind it;
and it remained so that the leg was completely swollen and the foot, and came to ruin.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come to unbind the leg; and when I had unbound it, he was at peace and felt no pain.
But still the corruption was already established in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was entirely lost.
And I saw another man who burst an infected abscess, and then it inflamed through the malice of its nature.
For a cancer, when it is pure of melancholic humor, it is not fitting that one touch it with iron unless it is in such a place that one can entirely remove what is corrupted.
And therefore, dear son, it is necessary that you know that the work of the hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is peril in many conditions;
and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and peril.
Therefore it is necessary that you guard yourself, so that foolish people cannot speak ill of you.
So take up your instruments carefully, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best method so that by the grace of God you come to salvation and are praised;
and leave the frightening diseases to serious physicians;
and remove your instruments from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you may pass from this world to the other in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake a serious illness unless you are called a wise physician.
I have divided this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is on fire cauteries and on cauteries of liquid medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head down to the feet;
and of the forms of the instruments, and of the cautery irons, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is on cutting and piercing, and on cupping and wounds, and on the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered, and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is on restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and it is ordered from the head to the feet, and the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of the help and harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of help and harm are the longest speech and subtle science and the secrets kept;
and of this many wise men spoke, and agreed on this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery universally helps every complexion where there is matter, except two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a complexion that is both hot and dry with matter, some debated and said that cautery is a great help; and others said the opposite: that cautery is not good for illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and a hot illness should not be treated with heat, nor with dryness;
and he who said the opposite said that cautery greatly helps a hot and dry illness that comes in the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it sometimes by experiment.
And yet, let no one meddle with it except he who has proven it, and who knows by long usage the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of the complexions of men, and the dispositions and the causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the span of time;
of the other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist diseases. And all the physicians assembled and agreed on the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and does not come forth except to the member which is cooked, and harms no other member except very little.
Burning medicines spread from one member to another, and cause the member to suffer illnesses of difficult healing; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its intensity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is superfluity.
And this I have found by experiment and by the length of service and study that I have devoted to the art, and it was based on the truth of things;
and therefore I excuse myself for the length of the speech, for I do not wish to deprive you of the secret which is contained in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels illnesses from the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agree on when cauteries should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the arising harm is overcome by the help of cautery; and especially if the cautery is for necessary pains, strong and urgent, which cannot wait until a greater illness comes to the limb.
And never think, dear son, as foolish physicians do; for the illness that is healed by cautery does not return; and they say so;
and they say so; but it is not as they believe, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is better than medicine for the speed of its effect, and for the virtue of its work and its power.
And it is possible that the illness sometimes returns according to the patient's complexion and the location of the illness and its strength;
and superfluities are gathered there by the consumption of food and similar things, unless cautery is administered where there is little superfluity and moisture, such as cautery of the teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and it is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is useful after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer various treatments for an illness and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Therefore it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish people.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is better than with iron, and they did not say this falsely, but because of the quality of gold and the nobility of its substance;
and they said that the cautery site does not become putrid, but that is not true because I have tested it, and I have found that it is true in some people;
and cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools down immediately;
and if one heats it too much; they do so in the fire; and thus there are enough impediments.
Now I have arranged this chapter from the head to the feet, so that the way may be easier to find.
This cautery is good for moisture and coldness in the brain, and there are two that are made because of an illness which is called "soda," and because of many humors which descend from the head to the eyes and ears, and because of a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and likewise for all illnesses which come from coldness such as paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be purged with purgative medicine purifying the head three or four nights, according to what the strength and age and habit of the patient can endure; and then shave the head of the patient.
And then make him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his knees;
afterwards place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and let your middle fingers be there, if it bleeds; then heat the cautery which is called "olivare", of which this is the form: And place it on the spot marked with ink, and move it downwards and inwards, little by little, rotating your hand; then lift your hand quickly, and observe the area to see if you see the bone only a little; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
Afterwards, take a little salt, and put it in water and moisten cotton in it, and apply it to the area, and leave it for three days;
Afterwards, apply cotton moistened in butter; and leave it on until the burn is gone; Afterwards, treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon," until it is healed.
And the ancients say that the longer the wound remains open, the more it purges; and therefore it helps healing.
And some of them say that one should leave the cautery on so long that part of the bone is burned, and then one removes what is burned from the bone, and it should heal.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on so long, and apply it so strongly that one burns away bone as wide as the whorl that women put on their spindles, so that the humors may issue out more readily;
and one should leave the wound open a long time; afterwards one should treat and dress it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be good at all, except in certain people where there is cause for fear;
and more it seems to me that I ought to leave it;
for the head is weakened by the continuous relaxations of nature, as we witness in other limbs;
and likewise when the patient's head is weak by nature, the first type of cautery is safer and gentler for me, and I use this method then in the same way for healing.
When chronic pain comes in the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills that are called "cochie", and head purges, and oils, and plasters; and if cautery is performed as we have said before, and it is not effective. Take care if the patient's head is of a strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize a little below that cautery which we have mentioned above. Afterwards, make a cautery on each temple of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and make a cautery in the place that is called "vessels"; and that is the place where cupping glasses are applied; and lighten your hand so that you do not go down to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the temples be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When a sudden pain comes to a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is purged by purifying medicines, and the other treatments that I have mentioned in the division of illnesses have been done, and none of this helps: then make cauteries according to two methods, that is to say, with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery of sharp medicine is that you take a slice of garlic, and remove the peel and cut it a little at the two ends, and then split the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the slice of garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, bind it tightly and leave it thus for twelve hours; and then unbind it and remove the slice of garlic, and leave the wound thus for two or three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the suppuration comes out.
Afterwards cure it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, do this with some cauterizing medicines that I have written in the twelfth treatise on cauterizing medicines.
The iron cautery is according to this manner. Heat the cautery which is of this form:
And it is called "closed" because the head is made in the form of a bell or it has a little curve, and in the middle a small opening;
and place it on the painful area, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the heart is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery does not burn, which is outside, and abundant blood flows.
Afterwards, put cotton in salt water, and apply it to the area for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery that is called "cultellare," use the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have previously described in the divisions of diseases, and it does not improve, and you see that the previously mentioned cauteries of medicine and iron are not sufficient, then you must heat the cautery that is called "cultellare" until it is white;
and bleed thus on the aching area a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and be careful that you do not cut the artery and that you do not reach the bone;
and beware of the mandible which moves when one eats, and the nerve should only move that which moves and that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of the flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or cutting brings great fear and especially to him who does not know it, and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have described in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two knives; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the earache from coldness
When pain from cold comes in the ear, and solutions and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division have been tried, and the pain does not subside, then heat this cautery which is called "points", of which this is the form:
Afterwards, prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the place of beginning; and let there be ten points around each ear;
afterwards cure the place until it is healed.
Of the torture of the mouth
A mouth injury that must be cured by cautery is only that which arises from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illness;
and do not perform cautery on similar injuries that come from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of injury that arises from phlegm, with hydragogue and purgatives, and head-washes and gargles, and this is not effective, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and place the cautery in the area that appears healthy, and make a cautery toward the top of the ear, a little below the corner of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half of the core is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it resembles the lancet that we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle and the knife should be a little thicker;
after, treat the area as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not improve, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place that is called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and it should be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, it is necessary to give the patient large herbs and pills that cleanse the brain;
after shaving the patient's head completely, and applying to the occiput the mustard plaster which is described in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the manner of the cautery: if you do it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, it is good; and if he is not, make three cauteries in the middle of the head descending to the neck, and let there be a space of one thumb's breadth between each cautery;
and cure it like the others, and if you wish to add, and the patient is able to bear it, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two temples, and cure it until it is healed;
and let the cautery be that which is called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of herbs and what we have said before;
after shaving the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each temple, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the deepest part of the flesh is burned, and lift your hand; afterwards treat it until it is healed, and let the cautery be that which is called "olivare" that we have previously mentioned.
of epilepsy
Epileptics should not use fire cautery except those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to cleanse the brain of humors and with other treatments that we have mentioned in the section when the patient is serious and suffering enough to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate it, give him gargles and mastications frequently cleansing the brain with good foods;
after raising the head in the middle, and apply one cautery according to what we have said before, and one cautery above the vessel, and on each temple; and if the patient is strong and suffering, apply cauteries as I have said for one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-sized according to the manner that I have described.
If the patient is a child, apply one small cautery according to this manner:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or the corrupted humors and thick phlegm are present, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for one who has paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities are inclined towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him something to drink to cleanse the brain, according to what is written earlier in the section.
Afterwards, shave the patient's head; then make a linen poultice, well made, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and let the patient sit cross-legged, and be well supported on all sides;
then present the liniment, and sheep butter is worth using; and warm it by the fire moderately, so that the fingers, if one puts them in, can endure it; then empty the circle inside onto the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient each week once, along with other good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, by making several points across the whole cautery.
This method of cautery softens the brain equally;
and then apply cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat.
of the water of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes, by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink something that cleanses the head, and guards it from all moisture, and make him sweat in the bath several times fasting.
Afterwards, instruct him to raise his head, and cauterize him in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is to both eyes together, or one if the descent is to one;
and with the whole cautery cut all the veins and arteries that are below the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and guard yourself against the flow of blood, and if you see too much blood flowing, then staunch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision of the cautery how you will staunch it;
and sometimes a cautery is made or applied under the two bones behind.
and one sees that it is of cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make for him the cautery that I have said in the beginning, of the water descending to the eyes: I cautery in the middle of the head, and II cauteries on the II temples, and II cauteries on the nape of the neck under the II bones; and if there is need for more, then cauterize him wisely above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
When you treat him according to what we have said in the division, and he does not improve, then give the patient three nightshade berries to drink; after shaving the head, and make a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery that is called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery that you do not cut it.
And this is the form of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery which is called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
of the hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelids are turned inwards, and prick the eye, and cauterization is done in two ways: that is to say, by fire, or by a burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then the patient puts [them] in your hand; afterwards, draw on the skin with the eyes a figure like the leaf of myrtle, and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs;
then put cotton moistened in egg white and parsley poultice on the eye, then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
After cauterize on the figure that you have marked little by little many times, so that the flesh is burned in that place;
and the sign of the success of the work is that you see the skin retracted, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it so for three days, then put cotton moistened in butter there until the burn is removed; after cure with ointment until it is healed.
And if after that the hairs come, and the skin is softened then begin again the cautery on that same place, as you did first;
and if the hairs are weak, cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf;
then take of French soap and quicklime, of each one ounce, and grind well together; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it on the form that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and put on the skin oils; and if the disease affects only one eye, one should operate on one, and if on both, likewise; and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and let the patient's head be on your lap and place your index finger on the medicine, and press it slightly and move it every time the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for it burns like fire.
When you have done this for a while, remove the medicine with your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, lift the area of water, and see if you see the membrane raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is well.
If not, put more medicine on the place where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are focused;
then put on cotton soaked in butter until the burning sensation has subsided, afterwards treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if it is necessary that you guard yourself well in your work with great care that none of the medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the skin becomes soft afterwards, and the hairs prick at the eye, repeat the medicine on that area which is softened by the skin properly, as you have done before; afterwards treat it until it is healed;
and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size, both large and small, and according to that should be your constraints;
and the right way should not be denied to him who studies this art.
Of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not help, then you must cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to put his head in your lap; and let the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that he does not move, nor shake his head;
then place moistened cotton in egg white or parsley juice on the eye;
then heat the cautery which is as follows:
and it is shaped at the head like the form of a vulture's feather, together with which is the cautery;
if you wish, let it be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, let it be like a tent;
but however, this one which is feathered is more useful for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and remove the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and remove the pus from within;
then apply the hot cautery strongly, and hold your hand on the cautery at the part of the nose above the eye, so that your hand does not falter; and put the cautery in the fatty tissue of the eye, and burn it.
If you reach the bone with the cautery at the beginning, that would be good. If not, repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need to, and leave it for three days;
afterwards put on cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, apply a corrosive watery medicine until the bone is uncovered; and treat it according to what is written in its chapter.
And there is a type of cautery for fistulas that some of the ancients described. Understand the fistula, and cut the place; afterwards put into the incision a thin tube of which this is the form: and it is made to the quantity of a .3. of lead; and hold your hand on the tube firmly, and the patient should not move at all, lest the melted lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one put on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
the lead thus burns the place of the fistula, and heals it by marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have mentioned, that is good. If not, then it is necessary to administer a hole in the nose, and to bring the fistula to the body of the nose according to what is necessary in its own place.
of the cracks in the lips Very often cracks occur in the lips which are called "chapped lips," and especially in the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the sections, and the treatment does not help, then heat a small knife cautery according to this form:
And apply it quickly to those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterwards treat the place with cerate until it is healed.
When an abscess forms in the root of the throat or in the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it festers and breaks and is old and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the divisions, and it does not improve: then it is necessary that you apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it, and the furthest point;
and do so once or twice, after treating it as we have said in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and it does not help, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery, whose form will come later in such a manner that you place a chain on the tooth;
and put the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
afterwards remove your hand and repeat the cautery according to your wishes;
afterwards let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and spit it out.
And in this manner, the tooth which was loose is fixed, and the softened gums are restrained, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
Of the toothache
When toothache comes from coldness, or there is cold or ice, and medical treatments are ineffective, then cautery is needed in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow butter, and put the end in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a tent, and moisten it in boiling butter, and apply it to the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it cools;
and thus do it often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, moisten wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron on it until the fire reaches the tip of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take an iron or bronze rod, and it should be thick so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth;
then heat the cautery, whose shape will be shown later, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter at the time of this cautery, and then rinse it out forcefully;
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whichever head you wish, and according to what you are able;
and this is the shape of the cane:
of the scrofula When the scrofula are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not amenable to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery head of which the form comes after, and it should have two openings for the fumes to exit on the other side of the cautery;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is healed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and tents until it is healed.
When humors overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be purged with solutive medicines;
afterwards apply a cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat, and not to burn the heart but just a little.
Afterwards apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the head of the spine, and let the cautery be that which is called "clavile" of which we have the form before;
and treat the place as we have said before until it is healed.
When all the illnesses of the lungs are from cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or dryness, and the illness is old, apply two cauteries on the clavicle in empty places; and one other cautery in the middle of the breast between the two nipples;
and let the cautery which is called "clavile" be according to the form which is said before.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking with the whole cautery which is called "points," of which the form is above in the illness of the ears;
and let the points be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After, cure the place according to that which is said before, and let the cautery have three rows according to this form:
And for this reason the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a stroke.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on his back and on his side; then lift the heart which is within the thorax with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated internally, heat the cautery which has two nerves, of which this is the form:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces to the side, and the figure of the cautery would come together with four cauteries;
and for this reason a cautery is made with the cautery which has three nerves, because of which the figures of cauterization are six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent peg and this is the form of the cautery which has three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to this, because of which there are eight cauteries.
Afterwards, apply the cautery with crushed poppy seeds and salt; afterwards make the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated upwards, which happens rarely, then make a cautery on the thickness of the cautery peg, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When in the stomach come colds and much moisture, so that it changes its complexion, and catarrhs are multiplied in it, and accustomed methods of cure do not help, then it is necessary that the patient be placed on his back, and extend his legs and arms. After this, make him three cauteries, one under the hollow of the breast the size of a finger, with the whole cautery peg, and two cauteries outside on the two sides, so that the shape of the cauteries is triangular, and there is such space between one and the other that they are not joined together when they discharge pus;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach the two parts of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and he who is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and bleeding on the stomach at one point according to the amount you wish to draw; then cauterize with the whole cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the cure that we have had before, until it is healed.
When pain in the liver comes from cold and moisture and great flatulence, so that it is removed from its natural complexion by superfluities; and the patient is treated with what we have said in divisions, and it does not benefit him, then it is necessary that the patient be bled on his arm; and apply three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, where the ribs of the man come;
and let there be between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be the length of a finger, and do not press your hand too hard on the whole cautery;
and let only half the heart be burned, and let the patient be upright on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him be lying down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a knife, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and beware that you do not burn the whole heart, for you would dry up the whole body; and that it does not reach boiling, for the heart is very delicate in that place, and know this for certain.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient does not feel very strong pain;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels excruciating pain.
And then when this treatment affects the eyes, it is necessary that the patient be supported on his head;
and then bleed from the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, of which here is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the flesh is burned, and it reaches the suppuration, until the puncture is completely burned;
after the treatment according to the treatment of boils until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that anyone use this cautery except those who have long studied the art of medicine, and through whose hands these diseases have run several times.
Then he can boldly work, and yet it seems to me that leaving it is better.
Of the cautery of pleurisy
The ancients said that for pleurisy one should make cauteries of aristolochia roots, and in this manner: take a long aristolochia root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and let it be as thick and as long as your fingers; and moisten it in oil, and hold it in the fire, and cauterize with the cautery between the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower down in the part that is under the chin;
and two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, leaning slightly backward; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and another on the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but act openly as if smelling.
And some ancients say that some people use a fire cautery similar to a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs until it reaches that abscess; and the pain leaps out, as we have said in the case of the liver abscess.
But in this operation there is fear that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops that cannot be healed.
of the mice
When you treat the disease of the mice, according to what we have said in the divisions of treatments, and it does not improve, then there are three kinds of cautery that are all good.
Of which one method is that you make three or four cauteries, in a line along the length of the mice, according to the figure of the liver cautery that we have described before;
and do not press your hand on the whole cautery, and let the patient often be on his back;
and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two points, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart which is in the area of the mice, or where the patient's pain comes from towards the left, and let the elevations from which you lift the heart be along the heart, along the length of the body, and the cauteries be along the width of the body.
Afterwards, put the two burning points in until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the whole cautery with three points.
After the treatment, when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this is better than the other treatments mentioned above.
Cautery is not useful for a dropsical person, except in the manner that is called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the sections, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the belly, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two on the back along the spine, and one near the breast; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not neglect the care of the patient after the cautery; and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be together with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the peg which we have previously shown; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is set forth above.
When the feet are swollen in someone who is dropsical, and are full of citrine water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the citrine water be ignited, and let the cautery be according to this form:
Afterwards, make on the two legs two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the little toe; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without cleaning, so that the water may come out;
after the treatment of the other treatments that we have mentioned.
When looseness of the bowels comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and cannot be cured by methods of treatment; and you see the patient is well-bearing and of strong virtue, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been spoken of before in the cautery of the stomach, a circular cautery; and four small cauteries around the buttocks, with one small nail cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the wrist, and one cautery on each temple, and two small cauteries on the stomach beside the large one, for the treatment is beneficial when there is good assistance.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and consist of large, cold, and moist corrupted humors, and have been treated as we have said in the divisions, and it does not help, then make cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, those which are quite outside below the shoulder blade little by little in a triangle, and one cautery below the buttock two fingers;
and if you think that his stomach is cold, and the food does not digest, and one sees the face swell, then make one large cautery on the stomach, as it is said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the whole clavicular cautery; and leave the cautery open a long time. After, cure the place until it is healed.
When you cut the althelul, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then put it, all burning, on that cut althelul; and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much althelul, cauterize each one as we have said; afterwards cure with beneficial ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on alchatim, it will have greater help.
When the patient cannot tolerate incision or opening, which we will relate in its place, such a disease comes that it cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula occurs in someone, and it is old and discharges pus and corrupt moisture, you should probe it entirely with a thin tent, and make sure you know entirely how deep the tent goes.
Afterwards, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula according to the amount that the tent entered, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupt flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the amount needed;
and beware of burning the nerves which are there, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and the intestine, beware of those places, and do not apply this fire except in fleshy places, and think that it is not penetrating;
Afterwards, treat the place until it is healed, and if the place is sealed, and the materials are removed for a long time, then know that the place is completely healed;
and if the materials are not removed, know that the place is perforated, and the bone at the bottom is corrupt; and in the same way as one of those that we shall describe in its place.
When cold pain comes to the kidneys, and great flatulence, and he does not desire women, then you must cauterize him on the kidneys on one side and the other with the cautery we have mentioned before;
and if we cauterize him in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, and they will be of greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then cauterize him in the outer part above the bladder, where the hairs of the groin begin, one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the width of a thumb;
and make one cautery on the outside of the back, or two if you need it;
and let the cautery be peg-shaped according to the form previously described.
When the womb is cold and moist, and does not allow conception, and the flowers (menstruation) are corrupted and their time is delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the buttocks, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries on the outside of the back;
and let the cautery be with a pin, as we have said.
When viscous humors descend to the hip joint, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and the place of the displacement is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient on the hip joint with one cautery resembling a circle, and bleed in front of the place around the joint as it turns, so that the joint is inside the circle;
and let the cautery be like that with which one cauterizes the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three cauteries of the size of olives, and let the cauteries be as deep as the heart;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the hip pain When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from coldness and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not effective, and the illness is old: then you must purge the patient of the gross humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. Afterwards, apply a cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is done in many ways, of which one is this:
that you cauterize on the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and wide, and have between each cautery the space of the thickness of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
sometimes a cautery is made in the middle on the head of the hip, wherefore there are four according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have described before in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle contains the whole hip, and all the tendons of the thigh are burned.
And this is the method used in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip and does not reach the thigh or leg.
And if it reaches the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers, on the left side a little;
and let the cautery be knife-shaped, and let the thickness of the flesh be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes or near them, cauterize where he feels the pain three or four points with the cautery that is called "points". And if necessary, make more for him;
and if he knows that the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make a cautery with a knife-shaped or circular cautery, and take good care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery on so long that you burn the nerves and large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have made a cautery on the ankle of the foot, and left it on so long that the leg was completely swollen, and the foot also, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted. After a bowel movement from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make a cautery in one and in the other, according to this manner.
And the wise men said in the cautery of the hip, of which this is the manner, make one such iron and let it be at the head as thick as a date pit, or a little less, and let it be between the notches and let it be from one notch to the other in width the quantity of a thumb's breadth;
and let the notches be open on two sides, and let them be also like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle;
and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws off sparks, and then put it on the hip joint that is diseased, and let it be turned towards the healthy side;
and cauterize it once with the round cautery and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use little of this cautery because of the fear of its appearance, and we see few who use it;
and however, this is one of the good cauteries, for those who can endure it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you make an instrument with interlocking parts into which the edge of the door descends, and it should be of bronze or iron with a long wall, and in height it should have two knuckles, and between each the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and they should be open outside and above, and join together according to this form:
Afterwards, place the box on the hip of the patient lying on his healthy side, and press your hand very much on the box of the hip; afterwards pour between the two circles of hot water which has been heated in the fire one pot, and leave it for one hour, and let the patient suffer the heat and burning from it.
For it causes a burning sensation, like that of fire;
and when the burning is past, lift your hand with the instrument and lift the hip from the warm water, and leave it thus for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the burn is removed; and leave it three days so that the pus is drawn out;
and this would be the last remedy after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make for it an instrument which holds water according to what you have done to the hip equally;
and this is the manner of the hot water, and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it;
where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it; and place on that pot another pot well sealed, and put on top alkali and lime and sweet water, until there is a finger's breadth above the powders when you have well pressed it with your hand;
and leave it thus until water descends and falls into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong water and is used in many medical procedures and in cauterizing other limbs.
For it does the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well, such as tesisie and honey and anacardi and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of hip pain and sciatica, and greatly praises it, and says that no other cure was made, and that he was healed at once when this cure was done, and he was bathed as he teaches below.
And he says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it very finely with one handful of fat, and apply it to the hip and thigh and leg where the pain is, and bind it;
and leave it for three hours, and according to the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is somewhat warmed, and make him enter the bed, and the pain will all go away and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps a great deal;
and the cautery should be done in this manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and put it on the pit which is between the thumb of the foot and the other which is called foscile.
Afterwards take dry goat dung, and heat it in the fire until it is coals, and put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do it again in the same way, and do not cease to do so until you think by feeling that it reaches down to the hip, and that the pain is ceased;
and this kind of cautery is called "goat cautery".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether from a fall or from a blow or from too great an evacuation, or from similar spread cold matter, in none of these cases is cautery useful, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is purged of fetid pills or other similar things, that three lines marked with ink be made on his back, where the pain holds, and in each line five cauteries or more, according to the strength and the quantity that the patient can endure;
and let the cautery be made according to the cautery which is called "points";
and if you wish, make three cauteries or four with the medium nail cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to small children, and the sign of the beginning is that they have shortness of breath when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in us the appearance which comes upon the other spines.
When you see this and you wish to cure it, cauterize it with the circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery takes each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery II or III lines, and let the points be close to one another.
After, cure the place until it is healed according to what we have said, and beware that you do not apply cautery to a gibbosity which is in a spasm of the nerve.
Of the pain of the joints.
When joint pain is from humors that are spread to each limb of the body, and when pain comes in the feet, which the physicians properly call "podagra," and when it is of cold cause and medical cures cannot cure it, then it is cured by cautery in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it is necessary that you cauterize on the face of the foot, make the cautery a whole cautery that one calls "point". And if the pains come down to the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, make cauteries on each knee, three or four on each side, with the whole olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there any longer than until the thickness of the heart is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and the back, administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist, two lines;
and if any pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the palm of the hand;
and if the pains reach the hips or the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good care to the patient and take medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the bowels descend into the scrotum and this is recent, it is necessary that when you wish to cure it, he does not eat that day; and that he uses things that loosen the bowels, so that the feces descend from his belly;
Afterwards, make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the bowels are returned, and push them back with your fingers, and make an incision below the rupture on the pubic bone, and with a whole sign which should resemble half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
until it is white and gives off sparks. Then return the bowels to their place; and the assistant hold his hand above so that they do not return back;
and open the patient's thighs well, and place a cushion underneath him and a servant on his thighs, and another on his chest to hold his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, then begin again another time until you reach the bone; and guard subtly that the bowel does not protrude when you do the cautery; lest you burn it; and that because of this the patient does not die, or other evils.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
And it is necessary that the cautery of children be subtle according to their size, and of adults also large according to their size;
after three days cure the place of the cautery with butter until the burn is removed;
afterwards cure it with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie for forty days on his back until the wound is well closed;
and it is necessary that his nourishment be light for a long time, so that his bowels do not move when he feels the urge to go to the chamber.
And after forty days, when he wishes to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and let him wear it for another forty days;
and let him have good rest, that he work little and guard against too great repletion of drink and food, and too loud laughter;
and when he has followed this teaching he is completely healed.
And I will describe the treatment of a wound in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they are not growing anymore, make a cautery with the cautery iron according to its size, and let a third of the heart be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that one should cauterize it with a three-angled cautery iron according to this form:
but first mark the place with ink and make one line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and hold your hand in the middle with the whole cautery iron.
But the first cautery is lighter and gentler.
of old pain in some limb When pain comes in a limb, whether from a fall or a blow, and that pain lasts a long time, and the treatment of medicine is of no use, then it must be cauterized with the cautery which is called "points", and let the cautery be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and its weakness and its virtue and its location of twists and its pain.
If he is healed by the first cautery, it is good;
if not, begin another cautery over that one, for such is the custom that it must move to the limb that is nearest, wherefore it is necessary that you make the cauteries until the patient is healed.
Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery with great benefit, and likewise the illnesses that come from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it cauterized, take care if the illness is at the beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend nor remain, and you fear that the corruption will overtake the whole patient, then make five cauteries on his head: one in the middle of the head at the nape, and another towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape;
and let your hand remain there until the cautery reaches the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize the mouse according to what is before.
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere; and it is manifestly apparent, then you must cauterize it with the cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and one cautery in the middle of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and another nearby, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the flanks, and two on the breasts, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one makes a cautery on the bone of the wrist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give, and the more it benefits him;
and know that the patient does not feel any pain from the cautery as the healthy do, because the body is already all corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in the various types of irons.
After, treat the place with chickpea flour with honey and other treatments until it is healed.
When an inflammation comes in a limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size of the limb;
and let the cautery be a little penetrating into the thickness of the flesh; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes a cautery is made on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the inflammation is removed;
and yet let no one meddle with it unless he is knowledgeable of the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the illness which is called "albaras" is advanced, and the means of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery somewhat deeply, according to the thickness of the heart, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then treat it with flour of vetch and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon's blood and swallow's blood, one part of each; and let it all be mixed together, and be bound with a cloth, and let it be kept in place until it is healed.
The treatment of cancer by cautery
When cancer appears at the beginning, and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the edge of the cancer.
And yet the wise men say that one should also cauterize the middle of the cancer;
and yet that does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen that happen sometimes;
and a more straightforward thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circular," as we have said in many cauteries.
When someone has an illness that is called "adubelati," and it is slow to mature either because of the superfluity it causes or because of the age of the patient when he is decrepit (that is to say, very old) and he has little blood, or because of the weather; and you want to hasten its maturation: then cauterize it around with many small, pricking cauteries; afterwards leave it thus. For it will hasten to mature.
And if you want to pierce it with the whole cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And place your hand in the middle of that illness which is called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the heart, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it externally in such a way that the course of the putrefaction is lightened.
Afterwards cure it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of illness which is called "corrodens", and it is nothing other than an eating away of a limb, for it eats the limbs like fire eats dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can withstand cautery with fire, then heat the cautery pins, small and large, according to what is appropriate for the place where the illness is;
after cauterizing on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places crushed sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
After that, cure with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good;
and if not, then begin cauterization again on what remains of the corrupted places.
And this ailment has sometimes been cured with a liquid medicine instead of fire cautery;
but nevertheless, fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the cure with liquid medicine in the section: take it when you need it.
of the swellings that come on the feet Very often it happens that on the feet, from without, a disease arises which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large, foul thing that wounds the foot.
And the cauterization of this disease is according to two methods. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is that you heat a cautery iron as if it were a goose feather, and it should be made of good iron to the measure that it can surround the nail on all sides, and that it has subtle edges;
afterwards put it, all hot, on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to shed pus; then make for him a poultice of wild mallows crushed with oil, and leave the poultice on all night, and the nail will fall and be uprooted from its roots.
Then cure the place with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if they are inverted on the outside of the body, and this often happens in hands and feet, then you must apply a cautery of hot water; and it is in this manner: take a chain of brass or iron, or a goose feather, and place it on the nail and the althelul, that is to say, warts; and place the chain so that it encompasses it entirely, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand well, and press your hand turning so that the edge of the chain reaches the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a way deep to the root;
and let the patient suffer the biting of the hot water a little for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will be uprooted entirely with its roots.
Do this one after another, until you have eradicated all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from coldness of the nerves, or from quartan fever or other, you must make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and one cautery on the foot, and one on the stomach with the olive cautery;
then the trembling will cease, and the health from the cold illness will hasten.
Sometimes there appear on the outside of the body boils, or foul pustules, which come from large corrupted matters.
then it is necessary, when they first appear, that one make a cautery on each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, of which the point is held in the fire, or of the root of long birthwort, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, according to this manner, and they cannot grow further, but the superfluities from which they come are broken up, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Often there are great flows of blood from the artery which is cut in the wound that comes from a burn, or in the incision of an abscess, or in the cauterization of a limb, and similar things; and it is a very serious thing to staunch.
And however when this happens to someone, hasten to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press it hard until the blood is calmed under your finger, and that no drop comes out anymore;
then put in the fire several small and large olive-shaped cauteries until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease doing this one after the other until the blood is stopped;
and beware that you do not burn the nerve which is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, one cannot easily stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways that we have said: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by tight binding with thread, or by medicines applied which have the power to stop blood; and let it be bound and pressed tightly.
Whoever attempts to staunch it by binding tightly with cloths or by applying burning things, or other similar things, will benefit little if at all.
And if this happens to someone and he does not have a remedy or medicine present, he should place his index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until it is staunched above the wound and above the vein; and not move the finger, but moisten it with cold water often, that it be very cold until the blood is congealed and thickened and staunched;
and then do what is necessary with cautery and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter every illness in which it is necessary to use fire cautery, or burning medicine, and the occasions and the causes and the instruments and the forms of cauteries;
and I placed that chapter from the head to the feet, and I will go in this chapter by that same way so that one finds more easily what one wants.
And before I begin this, dear son, it is necessary that you learn that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first of cauteries, and for that reason greater caution is necessary.
For in the work of this chapter there often happens evacuation of blood in opening the vein, and in the incision upon an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in the incision upon a stone, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you that you do not undertake folly. For many kinds of people come to treatments. so there come those who are so angered with their illness that they die easily because of the rage that they find in their illness, and because of the greatness of its malice; and of these one must be afraid.
And of these there are some who give you their senses, and say: Wait, I am healed"; and the illness is spiteful.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you who have this manner, but put more trust in your honor than in your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely in that which you are certain, and from which you can have praise and honor;
and use prognosis and indication in the treatment of your patients to whom salvation should be directed;
and that will help you acquire good reputation, and glory, and lasting praise.
Most dear son, May Our Lord give you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now I have ordered this chapter, dividing it into chapters, according to what is before, in the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to foot, so that you may more easily find what you need.
Know that this illness often comes to children at birth, and when the midwife pulls the child's head too hard;
and sometimes it comes from a hidden cause that is unknown.
And I never saw this illness except in children, and in all those whom I have seen, death hastened; and for that reason it seems to me that it is better for me to leave the work in such treatments.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled each day until he could not support it;
and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered under the bone above the brain, between the brain and the bone;
and the procedure is such that if the moisture is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you cut through the head a wide incision;
and let it be as long as two fingers, until the moisture runs out;
and here is the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is more extensive, and the abscess is larger, make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the signs that you see the sutures of the head open on each side, and the water spurts out when you press it from the inside with your hand, and this is not restored: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, draw all the moisture out. Afterwards, dress the incisions with cloths and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it thus until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head be bandaged evenly, and give the patient dry meat with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you observe where the size of the abscess is apparent, and the collection of water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Therefore, cut where the abscess appears, and the collection of water, and cut it according to your ability;
and beware that you do not cut the artery; and a flow of blood comes, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone has a disease called "catarrh" in the eyes or in the chest, and the disease is old, and the treatment of medicine does not help, then the last treatment is cautery, with this, that one will cut the two arteries.
It is necessary then, when you see them to be cut, that the patient throws back his head; afterwards rub the place with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens his neck with the whole cloth; then look where the vein beats, and the places of one and the other are behind the ears, and little are they hidden;
then mark the places with ink, then cut one and the other with a sharp spatula on two sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be by the width of the head.
And if you wish, put the spatula under the artery and cut it above, cutting as if with two fingers across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.
And if the artery is not felt, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut down to the bone;
and the amount of blood to be let out is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, according to what the patient can tolerate, and the fullness of the artery;
then examine the wound: if there remains on the bone a point of the membrane, cut it so that no abscess forms there, then bind the wound tightly and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine comes, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of the tears and the heat in the temples and old, raging headache and similar things, and it is treated with various methods of medical treatment and none of that helps, then we bleed the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the manner of their extraction is that the patient should move back the hair of his temples, and attend to the artery which appears in the temple, for it appears well by its beating, and is little hidden except in some men who are too cold;
and if it is hidden, let the patient tighten his neck with some cloths, then rub the area with some rough cloth, and bathe the area with warm water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula of which this is the form: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then draw it upwards with the forceps, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, then turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it from that part according to the quantity of the two ends. For if it is not cut, the blood will not flow completely.
And draw out six ounces of blood, down to three;
and if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that putrefaction does not occur before the healing of the wound, and there is a continuous flow of blood;
then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures at that very time, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery down to the bone until the ends are cut;
and this is the best method, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a warm complexion. For cautery helps to dry up the humors: therefore it is of greater help for humors.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and put on well-made tents;
and when one unties them, let it be cured with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with tents, until it is healed;
and if blood flows from the artery as long as you work there, hasten to cauterize it, or fill the place with vitriol and press it with your hand so that the blood is stopped; and if you do not have that present, put your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and sprinkle the place with cold water until the blood stops, and let it be extracted as is necessary;
And there should be a finger's breadth of thickness between the two knives, and then when you have marked the two places, and you place the burning iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and let them be distanced between the two ends because it is not completely sealed by this cautery in its entirety;
and this is the form of the cautery:
and that which is gentler and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery on two sides, but the sharp parts should be thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it retains its heat less.
of tears When the tears from the eyes are descending from the veins that are on the top of the head, and no medicinal treatment helps, and you see the patient's face redden, and he feels a throbbing in the forehead like a tremor; and his eye is swollen and moist so that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are inflamed and blistered from the heat of the tears, then this treatment is necessary. And the ancients called it "contusative treatment," and it is that you should make the patient who has this illness shave the hairs that he has on his forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contusative treatment," and it is that you should make the patient who has this illness shave the hairs that he has on his forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and let one of the incisions be like two fingers in the middle of the forehead, going down to the nose, and the other two on the two sides above the eyelids, and be careful not to cut the arteries that are on the two sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let each wound be the size of three joined fingers across;
and have prepared a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe the blood, then put the sharp spatula on two parts, of which this is the shape:
from the incision which is near the temple to the second incision; and scrape the whole scalp that is between the two incisions, all the surface that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second, and then remove this spatula. then put into the first incision the instrument which is called "cultellary", and is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is smooth, not sharp, and this is the shape:
And put the cutting side towards the flesh next to the scalp, and the smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to what appears of the scalp, and then do the same in the middle incision to the other end;
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the place for the blood taken;
then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and put on cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and guard against hot abscesses coming there;
and on the third day loosen the bandage, and apply a great quantity of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
When to some come an acute catarrh customarily, and you see the eyes weak and small, and the vision weakening, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that those humors and that catarrh do not come forth except from many veins, and the best cure that there is, is this.
And it is that you instruct the patient to raise his forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another a fingerbreadth wide. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move during eating;
and when the bone is uncovered, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, and then separate the two lips of the incision and place old cotton and linen tents there; then bind over it cloths moistened in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
When it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying things that cause flesh to grow.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow everywhere.
Of the stopping up of the ears
Whatever falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an animal, or a mine stone or something similar such as iron; or seeds, such as lentils, beans, peas; or something flowing such as water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone or other thing falls into the ear that does not attach itself to the ear, nor grow in the ear, put the ear to the sun.
If you see the stone, instill a little violet oil or oil of sesame, then proceed with extraction; and make him sneeze with hellebore, and stuff his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and stretch the ear upwards.
Often, strength returns through this treatment;
and if strength does not return, administer extraction with fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it comes out with the forceps, that is good;
if not, administer extraction with a fine probe of small diameter;
and if it does not come out by this means, make a chain of bronze and place the head of the chain into the opening of the ear firmly, and plug that which is around the chain with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the chain; then pull it out forcefully, for very often it comes out as we have said;
and if it does not come out in this manner, take birdlime, and put on the end of some pointed instrument for this purpose, and put a bit of cotton around it; then press the birdlime onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull it out.
And if it does not come out by all these means that we have said, hasten to split the ear before a hot abscess and spasm come;
and the manner of the incision is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw out blood according to the measure of his strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, at the fatty tissue or the depending area; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it as best you can, and suck it out quickly with your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin spatula according to this form: and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract it with fine tweezers and a sucker, as we have said, so that the extraction is light.
In the water then that falls into the ear, it is necessary that the patient first use sneezing powders, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on that same ear where the water is. If it jumps out because of this, it is good.
If not, take many stones according to the length of your middle finger, and light, and warm them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of his ear, and jump on it with his feet on the other side, and strike with another stone on the stone which is in the ear; and do not cease doing this with stone after stone until all the water comes out, and in this way it will all jump out;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and grasp the other end with fire until the greater part of the reed is burned;
then do likewise with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said with the stone.
In the extraction of the beast, if it is small bodied, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large-bodied so that one can feel it, administer extraction with tweezers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms lodged in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment does not help, then you must look into the ear in the sun: if any worms appear, pull them out with fine tweezers, and if they do not appear, take the candle of which this is the shape:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And put the most slender end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly on the whole candle; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey and come out, plug around the candle with cotton as I have said for the stone;
and if they do not jump out as we have said, administer distillations that the ancients have proven in the killing of worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and so distill your oils and your medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see: And let it be of silver or bronze, narrow below with one small hole, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation inside with a well-made bronze instrument for this, and if you wish take a razor and wrap cotton neatly around the point; then pour your oil or your juice, and what you wish of your medicines into the funnel, and the funnel should be in the ear;
then put in the razor with the cotton, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled or completely in the ear; and the patient feels it inside, and let the distillation be a little warmed by the fire before it is distilled into the ear; and ensure that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be as good.
Of the deafness of the ears
Some children are born who have no opening in their ears;
and this same thing happens to adults through the blockage of a wound, or of flesh growing inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear, so that one cannot see it;
and sometimes the opening is slightly obstructed, and one can see it well.
That which occurs deep inside, so that one cannot see it, is difficult to cure in many cases, and in that which one can see, you must put the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction clearly, then work with all this spatula of which here is the shape:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, completely smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
if the obstruction is of raw flesh or in the body of the ear, then hold it with fine forceps, and cut it lightly, until all that flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is deep in the ear, then take a thin, light rasp and warm it slightly in the fire, then place it in the body of the ear.
If you feel the obstruction from which the patient feels pain in hearing, pierce lightly, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear;
then place in the ear a tent according to the width of the opening, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment. Do this each day until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and sprinkle on crushed vitriol;
And if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and insert another tent moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; then treat it until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs, dip a sponge and cloths in cold water, and apply it to the ear, and use other treatments that stop the flow of blood which are in the treatment of distillations.
These styes that come on the eyelids when they are moist and dry, then you must stretch them with forceps and pincers, and cut them with a spatula from their roots; then put crushed vitriol on the place.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a thin lenticular cautery, and cauterization after incision is better;
and they often return when something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of the hail Often there appear in the eyelids things that resemble hail in form and hardness, and for this reason this illness is called "hail," and it is a collection of thick moisture in the eyelid above and below; the procedure is as follows:
the procedure is as follows: observe if the hail moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to know;
then make an incision in the width, then lightly scrape each part, then grasp it with tweezers, and cut it.
if you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it will not harm the patient;
and if the fissure is large, bring it together with a suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not use force, for ointments will quickly restore it and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone descends into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, invert the eyelid, and extract the hailstone with tweezers, and cut and press it from one side and the other;
and if the eyelid is moved by the incision, it does not matter;
and when the hailstone is cut, wash the eye with salt water, and treat the area with flesh-generating remedies until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a grease which is generated in the membranes of the eyelids, and this happens more to children than to anyone else, and it grieves their eyes very much, and they get catarrh in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because tears rush to their eyes;
and for that reason they always lie on their faces, and sleep on them, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist, as the swelling and the appearance are covered by the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the manner of the work is that the patient puts his head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity that contains exinach on each side, then put it on him; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle;
then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a cut of a certain width, and let it not be larger than the wound one makes in bloodletting;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several instances exinach comes from the cut, according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Then extract it whole with a piece of lint between your fingers, and turn your hand to the right and left until it is separated;
and be careful not to add to the cut, that you do not bring the whole spatula up to the eye, lest you injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the cut, slightly enlarge the cut a little until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and apply to the place, and bind with bandages.
And there are some who grind salt and apply it to corrupt the remaining moisture.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess appears in the place, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the testicles When hairs grow in the testicles that are not natural, and they are neglected, they harm the eyes and cause various diseases such as habitual tears and softening of the testicles and albuginea, to the point that it causes the destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by a sharp medicine according to what is before in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suture or by cautery, according to what I shall say.
It is necessary that you place the head of the patient on your lap, then turn the testicle towards your left hand;
if it is turned, it is good; if not, then put a needle with thread on it; and let this be near the edge of the testicle where the hairs grow near those hairs, and pull the thread over the testicle, and turn it around.
Then cut in the part under the testicle, under the attached hairs, with the cutting spatula, from the large tear to the small one;
then pull out the thread, and place under the testicle a small tent of cotton and cloth, then draw on the testicle a figure of an anchor, like a myrtle leaf, and however it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity that you wish to raise the testicle which is divided to all.
And if there is someone who needs to cut a large quantity of the testicle according to how the testicle is softened;
then cut with the spatula on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear down to the small one; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs in the thickness of a root, then place the onion in one of the two angles of the heart, then peel it entirely;
then bring together the two lips with a suture of a needle with a very fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and burn away the excess threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so;
and if not, then do not worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without suture with drying and constricting things, for the paper lifts at the closing of the wound and its joining, but the suture is better (as the ancients said), and this is work without fear; and there is another method:
and there is another method: and it is that you cut the paper in a shape like a myrtle leaf, as we have recounted, at three inches apart according to the shape which is here:
then cut that which overhangs with small forces equally according to the shape which is here:
And if you are not able to hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with one thread, and put it in the middle of the figure; and put one other thread near the large tear, and the second thread near the small one, and assemble the threads equally between your fingers;
then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have cut, as we have recounted, then bring together the two lips of the wound by suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, then soothe it with cerate and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the wound are inverted:
then you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the suture in one and the other is more skillful.
The treatment of the canines is according to this form: and that is that you should invert the wound and sew it inside as I have said, and then make two canines by art, and two fine threads as long as the wound and as wide as the spatula is; and cut at the two ends of the two parts where you hold the threads;
then carefully join one and the other on top of what protrudes from the wound of the eye, and tightly bind the two canines of the two parts; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin which is bound will die and shrivel and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it is slow, then cut it with some force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is healed, and the membrane is lifted, and the hairs no longer prick;
and this is the form of the two canines that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
the work is such that you take a fine needle, and put in it a soft and fine silk thread; then bring together the ends and tie them both subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the chase another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then let the patient put his head in your lap;
and let it be near the sun so that the work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then put the needle with the chase into the root of the added hair, and make it pierce the skin quickly until you draw it over the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the chase, and put that hair into the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
then withdraw your hand until the hairs come out with the chase into the skin along with the natural hair.
And if the chase is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then pull the chase downwards with all the thread that you have ordered there, until the chase comes out of the hole above and you see it with the sight of your eye;
then you will pull the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair heals in its place and the flesh grows over it;
and if the hair is small, accompany it with a long hair from the natural hair, and let it grow with that one, or leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
Of the corruption of the eye When this illness which is called "aleacrati" or corruption comes to the eye, there are two kinds of it:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens through a sudden wound, or cut, or cautery, and by similar things.
And the manner of working on it is that you split that seam, and separate its lips, and put inside linen tents, and bind it until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things that dry and constrict. For if you do that, the illness returns worse than before;
but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and rosewater or mallow and linseed boiled, and diachylon ointment melted in some oil, and wrap a tent, and cure it with that.
And the key to your cure is that you take care that it does not heal according to the way it was before;
and these operations that we have described are nothing but treatments for this illness, so that it does not return as it was before.
This illness that is below, which is truly called "axacrati," and is natural and accidental.
The accidental [cause] comes from wounds and fissures and cautery and similar things;
and the method of operating on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and you stick it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left lachrymal duct to the right, so that the thread comes out at two ends of the flesh;
then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it to a width of one spatule. And if the shape of the paper returns as it should, it is good;
if not, take a rasp and put it in the fissure, and turn the paper, and make two fissures on the inside edge of the paper;
and let the ends of the two fissures be at the two corners of the incision that you have cut, and make an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the shape of a letter which is called "I Greek";
then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its sides are sharp underneath, from that which follows the paper, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a woolen thread;
then cure it with what we have said of softening medicines, and with tents, until it is healed.
And if the illness comes from a fissure or suture or cautery, then you must make a full incision under the hairs of the wound, and according to what is above; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said;
then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master applies his skill with all his might so that he may restore the form to its natural shape;
and the patient himself, according to what is necessary in work and instruments in several situations.
When this adhesion happens to many men in such a way that the wound above is adhered to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the point of a razor under the wound and lift it up;
and extend it with tweezers, until you cut what is attached with a fine spatula, which is not too sharp nor too blunt, so that the patient may not suffer from the too sharp spatula injuring the eye;
and let your incision, with which you remove that adhesion, be light, so that the wound returns to its natural form;
and when all that adhesion is healed, they sometimes put salty water in the eye, and then wash it with fresh water and eyewash;
then place between the wound and the eye a linen tent, and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after the third day use eyewash and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the corner of the eye is according to two manners: it is nervous and similar to hard tissue, and another which is not nervous, but is similar to congealed white moisture, that when one touches it with iron and thinks to pierce it with pincers, one cannot;
and both forms begin towards the lacrimal gland, and grow little by little until it covers the whole sight and all the light and movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the growth with small double forceps, and extend it upwards; then take a needle, and thread it with a horsehair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and stick it into the growth, and pierce it with the whole needle, and tie the growth with a thread and extend it upwards, and scrape with the hair the side of the growth that follows the pupil and the silk on the hair to the head, then cut the remainder at the root of the lacrimal gland with a fine spatula and small forceps, and leave the natural flesh at the lacrimal gland, so that the flow of tears is not interrupted by the incision;
and sometimes the growth is extended only with the hook and thread, as we have said; then scrape it with a smooth spatula of which this is the form:
And take care that the spatula does not touch and break the fleshy membrane, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, put a little crushed onion and a decoction made from litharge into the eye, and leave it until the next day; then treat it as necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive, and you cannot insert the needle, and the hook cannot enter, this type of nail is often cured with medicines;
and grow as I have recounted in the division, and if you see it growing, open the patient's eye, and take a light, slightly sharp spatula in this shape: And shave the nail carefully, and if you see that it diminishes and the erosion approaches it, then drip into the eye from your mouth a decoction made from litharge and red decoction and crushed onion, and plug the eye until the next day;
If nothing is obstructing the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first treat the hot abscess until it is healed, then recommence the work as before, until it is healed.
then recommence the other work according to this same method, until it is completely removed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the tear duct harms the eye by great annoyance, then suspend it with a hook, and cut a part of it and not all, so that the tear duct is not damaged;
then drip into the eye red decoction which is made from litharge.
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows, and covers the pupil and extends over the eyelids and turns them outwards, and resembles a pomegranate rose;
and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and you grasp all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and support it firmly;
then cut the first flesh, and keep cutting with a razor to the end, and be careful that you do not injure the eye during the procedure;
and let the incision be of the spatula we have mentioned in the incision of the nail and for small forces with which one removes the sebaceous cyst, as the figure after this chapter shows;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, apply crushed celandine oil or distil red copperas and similar corrosive medicines there, and place a cotton pad over the eye with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and the hot blood overwhelms you, and you fear a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe hot abscesses;
then return to your work until it is healed, and do so whenever flesh is added to the eye in this way.
But nevertheless, it is necessary that you ease the treatment of each weak eye by natural means; and by accidental means, with iron instruments;
and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that the limb is able to withstand that operation.
There are red veins that are covered over the eye, and they take away its function and weaken the eye always.
It is necessary then first that you look if the eye, in which the sebel is, is strong, and there is no other disease besides the sebel; then treat the eye in this manner:
instruct the patient to put his head in your lap, then cut those veins with the ointment according to your wisdom, and let the ointment be subtly double according to this form:
And let there be two ointments by degrees in one body according to this form:
then that one treats forcefully those veins subtly, and wipes the blood hour after hour, until you see remove those veins from the eye;
and beware that you do not injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this work at midday before the sun, and be very fervent in your work so that you cut only those veins;
and when you have done this, then distill into the eye green and red gall to corrupt that which remains of the pus.
And if you are not able to collect all the pus at that time, then make a plaster on the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it some days until the pain is eased and the hot abscess is certain, then begin again in this manner which is before until it is healed;
and this is the manner of the treatment:
The Arabs call a fistula "arissati":
When you treat it with cautery and with burning medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, then there is a device whereby you incise above the abscess, where it should ripen, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it all away with the instrument of which this is the form;
and it is called "rough head," and let it be made of iron, with a round head, and pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the site of the corrupt bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that that corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the bone is healed, and remains so for forty days, and it does not renew and is not abscessed, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other method than to return the fistula to the hole of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered then take a drill according to this form, and let the head of iron have three angles, and let the shaft be tapered to the head as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the drill completely until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, then the matter goes to the nose; it is easier for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open and there is no obstruction or reduction in the nose, you must bind the patient;
then cleanse it, then apply cupping glasses or scarification without wounding to draw out the humor, then apply to the eye a liniment made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla, and then bandage the eye, and apply a plaster with bandages and cloths;
and the manner of the cloths is that you take soft cloths, and fold each one four times, and then place one over the other according to the amount the eye needs;
then bandage it tightly from above with a firm bandage, and repeat the cupping glasses to draw out the humor without wounding;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bandaged day and night, and if the liniment softens, you must bandage it very tightly;
then remove the liniment after a day and night, and if you see the eye repairing, it is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster and cloths and the liniment and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
Of the rupture of the uvula When disruption comes to the uvula, then it opens, and there comes forth papers like grains of resin, and it is frightening to see;
then if you see it split, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the lower part up to the upper, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear; and pierce it there, and leave the first needle in place;
then cut the double thread and tie a part of the uvula around it, and pull it well, then remove the needle and place on it wool soaked in egg white;
and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvula, then treat the area with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is constricted by the uvula on each side with a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye gives great appearance, pierce it with a fine spatula that reaches the depth of the eye, and break up the white moisture and the eye will descend, and enter at once;
then remove it until it is healed.
This illness which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a swelling which is gathered in the eye, resembling descending water, and it is not water;
and the manner of the operation is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on two sides, and move it until you see the swelling come above to your eyes; then let it be fixed, and not descend and let the light be unobstructed, and let the patient see things as he was accustomed;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the swelling is not prepared as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take a fine spatula and make an incision on the cornea with a continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the crown, until the swelling comes out;
and when it is out, then distill into the eye warm water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled and honey, then let it be treated with other treatment until it is healed.
of the waters of the eye We have here the similarities of the waters in the division, and what is necessary to pierce; then work according to the health.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and squeeze very tightly;
then put the paper of the eye to your left hand if the eye is left, or to your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the point of the instrument near the cornea by the thickness of a hair in that white of the eye at the part of the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument which is called "almagda" skillfully, and turn your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty thing;
and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's path be at the depth of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the cornea of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that membrane because of the clarity of the corneal tissue, and then place the instrument to the place where the water is, then express it from below one way after another.
if the water descends immediately, the patient sees in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
After a short rest, and if the water rises the second way, put force with the instrument, and when it is inserted and it does not rise, then extract the almagda lightly, turning your hand little by little;
and then put a little rock salt in water, and wash the eye inside. Then put on the outside of the eye tampons or wool moistened in rose oil and egg white, and bind with a healthy eye.
We, and those of our time, apply crushed cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then you must take the instrument which is called "alberit", of which this is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a small opening, then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and upon completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable sleeping place, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and let him be free from all movements, and take light foods, and do not move his head either to the right or to the left, and let him be bound according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in that same dark house, and test his sight, and make him see some things, and then put the bandage back on until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary that you do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but it is necessary that you delay this, because the water rises quickly.
If a warm abscess appears, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with something that soothes the abscess;
and when it is calmed, then unbind the sight and put on his face a small pillow to cover for a few days, and let him always be in that dark house.
And then let him go out of the house little by little, and return to his affairs;
and know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And a man came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made almond-shaped things, from which one sucked the water, but however, I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read of it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almonds, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and they should be properly of bronze: And let the heads of them be of this same subtlety, and the end in three sharp angles.
Sometimes there arise on the nose added fleshy growths, of which there are some that resemble scorpions with many feet;
and there are such where there is embedded flesh of a livid color, and there is soft flesh of good color. In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not embedded, it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands against the sun;
In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not embedded, it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands against the sun; and open his nostrils, and throw the onion on those fleshes, and pull them out; then cut that which you can sustain with a fine, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that that flesh is all removed.
And if anything remains which cannot be cut, then work it all out with subtle instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if pus overcomes you, or a hot abscess, then treat it as is necessary;
and if it is malignant abscesses, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then pour on it vinegar and water or wine. If the nose works, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that he is healed;
and if moisture does not break through as it should, know that there is dead flesh in the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut:
then you must put in a rather thick linen thread, knotted on both ends, and have a finger's width or less space between each knot; and let the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as far as he can, and pull it gently until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and often children do this at school, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it;
then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other, sawing at the knots that are on the thread.
Do this until you see that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
do this three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh;
and then put a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, then use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which one distills oils and medicines into the nose:
And let it be of silver or bronze, similar to an open lamp, like a cannula, and the conduit likewise;
and if you wish, make a closed cannula, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and have a handle at the top to hold it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh above the nose
Many times a disease called "telul" arises at the head of the nose, and grows and becomes large continuously, until it is a frightening thing to behold;
and therefore it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning, and remove it entirely, then apply the cautery or burning medicine to the place;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take care if it is hard, of a livid color, and insensitive:
then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not livid in color, and you see that it can be entirely cut, then empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the place with drying and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilaginous structures, it benefits little, except in some men.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then bring the two lips together with a suture, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, you must scrape all parts of their edges until they bleed, then bring the two lips together with a suture, and bind it, and sprinkle on powder of dragon's blood, and ground incense; and put on the powders a piece of strong plaster or another consolidating plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of suturing is that you bring together the edges: or with needles, as we have said in the suturing of the belly; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of abscesses of the lips
In many men there occurs within the lips a hard abscess, similar to vesicles, some smaller and some larger;
then you must turn back the lips, and incise each lump, and take it with forceps and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with crushed vitriol, until the bleeding is stopped;
and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the place with dry things until it is healed.
Often there grows on the gums added flesh, which the ancients call "albulus";
then you must hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and let the wound or blood run;
then put on the place crushed vitriol, or other astringent and desiccative powders;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: then it does not return after the cautery;
Sometimes there are gathered at the roots of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, crusts which are foul and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and worm-eaten, until the corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
then you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head should be on your lap, and clean the teeth or the crusts which appear, until nothing remains; and so do with the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and the other stains, until they are cleaned;
and if one removes what is there at the first scraping, it is good; if not, then begin again the second and third day, until you have cleaned everything;
and know that the teeth need various forms of instruments for cleaning, according to what the work demonstrates, because the scrapers with which one cleans the outside of the teeth have other forms than those with which one cleans between the teeth; and these and other forms should be prepared and ready with you.
It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay extraction as long as you can, for one should not do this; for it is a very high procedure, until then one has no excuse for extraction.
Then, when the patient is compelled to extraction, it is necessary that you are certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a healthy tooth, and causes a good tooth to be extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of that, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this happen to these physicians;
and when you are certain of the aching tooth, it is necessary that you scrape around the tooth with a very strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides;
then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly attach the forceps; and let the patient's head be firmly between your knees, and hold it so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out easily, take one of these instruments and insert it inside from each side lightly, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated and decayed, you must fill it with lint where the holes are; and extract it carefully with forceps, so that it does not break during extraction;
and it is necessary to work very wisely around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And I warn you well that you do not break it, and that a part remains, and that greater pain than the first returns to the patient because of the malice of the root.
And beware that you do not act as ignorant healers do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the tooth, and do not achieve what we have described;
but sometimes cause a great illness because of the roots that remain, or because of the tooth that they break, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is extracted, wash the place with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, apply crushed vitriol to the place;
and if that does not work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments with which one first moves teeth should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you extract the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And let them be of thick members so that they do not bend when pulling, and let them be of well-made iron, and let them be toothed to hold better.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains during extraction, it is necessary that you place cotton soaked in butter on the place for one or two days, until the place is softened, then place there the forceps which are called "algefri", of which the head resembles a bird's beak;
and let them be made inside like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with all these forceps, it is necessary that you uncover the flesh all around the root, and place there the instrument which is called "althali", that is to say, a small plank, of which this is the shape:
And let it be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root comes out by this means, it is good;
if not, then help yourself with all the instruments, of which the shapes come afterwards:
And one helps oneself with this instrument which has two prongs, of which this is the shape: and of other instruments which are in front in the extraction of teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large forceps, of which this is the shape:
And let this instrument be strong so that it cannot break, and know that there are many instruments for teeth; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise and subtle master finds his own instrument, according to what his work and the illness show him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of cases; and if one breaks a piece of the cart or of other bones, or if it rots, then he searches for the instruments which are necessary, which I have told you, and helps himself with gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be thick and well-holding to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but that it can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with medicines suitable for this, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it with this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to their natural course, and the shape is ugly, and especially in virgin women, then you must know if the tooth is grown after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and one cannot file or smooth it:
then scrape it; and if it is fused with the tooth, then take this instrument of which here is the form, and it is similar to a small beak, and let it be of iron, sharp at the tip:
And cut it little by little over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is apparent that one can file it, then file it with such a file as here is the form:
and it is like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days lightly, so that it does not move until it falls;
then smooth it at the end with some kind of scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, then it is necessary to file the roughness until it is even, so that it does not hurt the tongue nor corrupt the speech.
When the front teeth loosen, either by percussion or by falling, and the patient cannot press on what he eats without their falling out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and that does not work;
then they must be restrained with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes;
and let the thread be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and double it between two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you skillfully reach a healthy tooth on the other side; then begin the wrapping again to the point where you started, and tighten your hand subtly and skillfully, so that it does not move;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and place them between the healthy tooth, and position it so that it does not injure the tongue;
and then leave it thus tight as long as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread;
it will remain and serve thus its entire time, and this is the form of the teeth and the manner of arranging the two healthy teeth, and the two that have moved, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one puts it back in its place, again and again, as we have said;
and let no one meddle who is not wise and patient, and sometimes one makes a form of a tooth from ox bone, and one puts it in the place where it is lacking, and one tightens it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus a long time.
Sometimes this ligament comes from under the tongue naturally, that one is born thus; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and have their head in your lap, and lift their tongue;
then cut the nervous ligament widely, so that the tongue is freed from its constraint, and if there is hardness or a knot, and this is from a sudden wound, then put in the hook and cut widely that ligament;
and take care that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery which is underneath;
and when you have done, wash the area with rose water and vinegar, or cold water, then place under the tongue a linen tent;
and let the patient dress it each night, so that the wound cannot close.
And if excessive bleeding occurs, apply crushed vitriol to the area; and if the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize it with the lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with another treatment until it is healed,
and if you see it of a dark or black color or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is cancer;
and if it is inclined to become a whitlow, and there is moisture, apply onion, and lance it with a fine spatula, and release it on one side and the other; and if the bleeding overcomes you in your work, apply crushed vitriol until it is stopped, then return to your work until you have removed all the pus;
then raise the place with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of the abscesses of the throat Sometimes there come within the throat swellings which are called "godath," and they are properly called the two almonds, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then take care:
if this abscess is hard, small, and of a dark color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the flow of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will break by itself;
and if it is of a reddish-white color, and the root is thin, have the instrument ready for cutting, but first see if the warm abscess is settled and calmed.
Then have the patient sit before the sun, and his head should be on your lap, and the operator opens the mouth and the assistant takes it between his hands, and presses the tongue down with the instrument, of which this is the form;
and let it be of silver or of thin bronze like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out upwards as much as you can;
and pull out some of the membranes with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the form, which resembles small forceps; and both ends are curved, and one towards the other, and they are very sharp, and it is made of Indian iron or bronze:
And if you do not have this instrument at hand, then cut it with pliers, of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, let the patient gargle with warm water, and vinegar and honey, and if bleeding occurs, let the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate bark has been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two tonsils, then cut them in the same way as the two tonsils.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat, that is to say, a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained so for one or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had pushed out two veins through the two openings of the nose.
I hastened then immediately, and inserted a lancet into one, then pulled it out, and pulled out a large portion of pus;
then I did likewise in the other opening of the nose, and I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the lancet into the abscesses, and cut a part of it, and there came out only a little blood; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease cutting the abscess for a long time;
and the abscess grew again, and filled the space that I had emptied, until it was very large;
then I cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did with her after me.
of the grape
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and elongated, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is thick and round below, it is called "uvula".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the heat of the abscess is subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it;
and that which is round, gathered and not long; and it is blood-colored or dark colored or black, then you should avoid incising it. For there is great peril to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner that I have said, of its whiteness and its length, you must make the patient sit before the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention above; then insert the hook into the uvula, and draw it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And you must not cut more than the superfluity which is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you injure the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of cutting, then you must use a method of cauterization so that he feels no fear.
And the manner of cautery is with a sharp needle. And it is that the patient puts his head in your lap, and then you press his tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize with heated boiling water, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and apply the end of this instrument, of which here is the form:
And it has on the head a cavity where one puts the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and put the instrument with all the medicine on the uvula;
and the patient be lying on his side, so that the saliva and mucus run from his mouth away from the medicine inside, so that it does not descend into the throat and injure it;
then hold your hand with all the medicine and press it on the uvula, the quantity of half an hour, until you see it wither and the burning from the medicine is subsided;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around some instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton into the mouth above, until the cotton touches the uvula;
and do this often, until the cautery is perfect, then leave it dry, and it falls after four or five days.
And if you need to restart the cautery with the medicine, then restart it, and after the cautery wipe around the uvula with cotton dipped in butter, and cleanse what is around the medicine;
and let it be sprinkled with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, or cautery;
if it is treated by fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and origanum and rue and chamomile and oats and similar herbs, and mix them all or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar, and boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and in the middle of the pot have a tube fashioned in this manner: And let it be of silver or bronze, and let one end be placed in the mouth of the patient so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is cauterized;
afterwards repeat it often, until the uvula is dry, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the appearance of a hot abscess, for various things happen; and do not do this except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, take a tube and place inside the end a piece of eggshell, so that the mouth of the patient is not too hot; for the eggshell does not allow the vapor to harm the mouth, and this is a good treatment and also healing.
Often a bone or fish spine, or something else, gets stuck in the throat;
then you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue with the instrument towards the sun, so that you can see the thing move;
and what you cannot see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is cooked in the stomach; by chance the thing will come out backwards through vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it; and when it arrives at the place, it will stick, and then pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, take a lead instrument according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it may more easily enter the throat, and have the head lifted up; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest a cough comes to him, nor thrust the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient put in the instrument, because he knows better where the thing is lodged; if he pushes it down, or pulls it out with the instrument equally, until it is out.
Of the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when that does not help, then look in the patient's throat in the sun, then press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with subtle tongs that are good for this.
And if that is not effective, take a hair-rope, and put it in the patient's throat, then put a hot iron at the end of the rope, and do this often. And let the patient drink water every day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with his hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, fumigate the patient with asafoetida, using the instrument I described in the fumigation for the uvula;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals, and let the pot be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole let the head of the instrument be;
then throw in your fumigation, and the patient puts the head of the tube in his mouth, and closes his mouth so that the smoke does not escape, but comes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and sharp things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary that it come out forcefully by this treatment.
And the form of the instrument with which one pulls out the leech is, when one can see it, similar to curved tongs for easily entering the throat; and it resembles a bird's beak, and has a roughness like a file, so that what it grasps, it cannot let go;
Many kinds of abscesses exist, according to what is remembered here and there in this book, and they differ in perforation and size;
and that is in two ways, one of which is in its very appearance, and from what it contains of moisture.
And the second way is because of the places where they are in the body.
For abscesses of the head are different from those of the fundament, and abscesses in fleshy places are different from those that occur in joints, and each has its own judgment in treatment.
And there are abscesses which one should not pierce until the swelling is ripe according to its development;
and there are some that it is necessary to pierce when they are grown and do not ripen according to their development, such as abscesses which are near joints.
For when abscesses occur near joints, and one leaves them until they are rotten around, by chance the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Or if the abscess is near a principal member, and you delay perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the principal member;
or if it is near the fundament, one pierces it before it is ripe;
and it is not necessary that you pierce an unripe abscess without completed digestion, except that which is near the fundament, lest it rot deeply and become elongated inwards, and a fistula develop there; and cannot heal in a long time.
And you must know the time for perforating a ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain is lessened, and the fever departs, and the lessening of the pain and redness, and of the throbbing and sharpening of the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and you must make the perforation at the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears softened;
and let the perforation be along the body, and if the abscess is in the hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all similar places where there is no danger. In those that bend, along that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you leave the perforation until it is confirmed in completed digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the poison will be spread from it, and it is full of much filth; and perhaps the lips and depths of it will harden.
And if there is any abscess that is pierced according to the breadth of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you make small perforations in small abscesses; and in large abscesses, large perforations, and many fissures according to the likeness of the size of the abscess;
and there are such abscesses where it is necessary to reach the core, and cut; when it has become like a rag, and is mortified, it is necessary to do as one does with buboes:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some which one cuts like a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the angles;
and there are some where one makes a round incision, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those which have no head, like a superficial soft abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected much pus, and you pierce it, not to draw all the pus at that time, but to draw a part; then plug the abscess until the next day, then draw out something again; do this many times gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or small child, or an old decrepit man. For the spirit sometimes leaps with the exit of the pus, so that by chance the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore, approach this chapter with great caution, and when you have perceived your abscess, cleanse the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a full incision, apply tents of linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, it is necessary that you insert a tent into each so that they meet one another;
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have shaved it around, it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton or linen shavings without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs in your work, apply cold water and vinegar, and moisten a cloth, and apply it to the bleeding area many times.
And if the bleeding persists, administer treatment and care, and the powders that I have mentioned in other places in this book, and if it is winter, and the place where the abscess is is very nervous, it is necessary that you apply tents and cloths moistened in hot wine and oil;
and if it is summer, and the place is fleshy, it is necessary that you apply cloths moistened in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then open the abscess and clean it and treat it, as is necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be universally known in the treatment of abscesses:
Now I have told you how one should proceed in the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
In the head come small abscesses, and there are kinds that are web-like, like the honeycomb of a hen, and there are many similar ones.
There are fatty ones and others where there is moisture, like pus;
and there are some that are hard and stony to the touch, and there is no doubt if the artery does not oppose it.
And the work of the incision is such that you test with the instrument called an "entromissoire," of which the form comes later, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then lance it from above lengthwise.
And when the moisture is emptied, scrape it without leaving anything of the skin that contains that moisture, for it returns again when one leaves anything there;
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in water and salt, and apply it to the wound, and leave it until the next day; and that will draw out what remained from the night.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know well that nothing remains from the night;
then treat the wound with a suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains thick matter, cut it lengthwise according to this form; and put in your ointments, and scrape it on all sides, and put all your effort into drawing out the matter where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, then do what I have told you afterwards.
And do likewise for an abscess if it is stony, and in the cutting and cleansing as I have told you.
And the incision on a stony and moist abscess is easier, for they contain little blood. And if there are some of these abscesses on the head where there is no moisture, and of these I cut an abscess on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, and white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck it, one would have made a wound as well as from a stone.
In other abscesses occurring on the head, except those which come at the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, so that the pus may exit;
and treat them as is necessary.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they occur elsewhere on the body, and are many, and are interconnected with one another.
And each scrofula is properly within its own sheath, like a nut and the abscess of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
and the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not wish to obey health.
In that one then which you see of good disposition to the touch, and is similar in color to the body, and is soft on every side and is not close to the nerves of the neck or to the artery or to the duct, and is not deep;
then you must cut it open from above, and peel it from each side, and spread the two lips of the wound with hooks, if you need to, as we have said in abscesses of the head;
and draw it out little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let the spatula not be sharp or cutting, lest the hand slip, and do not go too far, lest you cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and that does not allow you to work, then put in the wound crushed vitriol, or some powders that staunch blood, and bind the wound; and leave it until the abscess is subsided, and the wound is softened, and begins to fester.
And when the bleeding is stopped, then return to your work, until you have completed it;
then search with your index finger if there remain any small scrofulas, cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, then it is not necessary that you cut that scrofula at its root, but tie it with a strong doubled thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then dress it.
And if you cut the whole scrofula, then you must bring together the two lips of the wound, and sew them immediately, since there is no remaining superfluity because of the size of the scrofula. then you must take care to cut its root and pull it out, and sew it as we have said.
then you must take care to cut its root and pull it out, and sew it as we have said. Those scrofulas which contain superfluity, pierce them where a head appears;
and pierce it like the one previously mentioned, downwards, then apply tents with ointment and similar things, so that it consumes what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the incision of the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the fissure of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be avoided; and that no help be given by this, because all the veins and the lung of the patient are near to those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the two tonsils.
When the illness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the loss that comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we want to cut the epiglottis, we must cut it below three or four circles a small slit across, between the two circles or by the amount of the slit of the [syfac], not in the cartilage;
and that place is suitable for the section of the epiglottis that there is no flesh, and the vessels are far away.
And if the master is fearful, it is necessary that he stretch the skin of the throat with the hook, then cut the skin until he reaches the channel; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the [syfac], as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the flow of phlegm from the channel which leaps forth through the place which is broken, and by the loss of voice;
and leave the wound open a while.
And when the hour has passed in which strangulation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound of the throat, and sew it all alone without the cartilage;
then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely swollen, and the patient is judged to be dying, and lacks breath. Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for that reason the ancients ordered leaving the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they ordered sewing the wound and healing it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young lady took a knife, and stuck it in her throat, and cut part of the channels of the lung;
and I was called to heal her, and found her as good as dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had issued from it, and I knew well that she had not cut a vein or duct except the throat, and the wind came out through the wound.
I hastened, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and nothing happened to the young lady except that she was hoarse, and afterwards returned to her normal state;
therefore I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no need for fear.
This abscess is called a "hernia of the throat", and is a large abscess the color of a yellow-green, and is very common in women;
and is of two kinds: natural, and accidental;
or natural has no remedy.
And the accidental is of two kinds, of which one is similar to a lipoma, and the other kind is similar to an abscess which comes from an artery; and there is fear, and it is not necessary to operate with hot irons except in that which is small, and prove and search with the whole probe: if you find it like a nut of fat, and it is not attached to any vein, cut it, as one cuts nuts, and pull it out with its covering, if there is any; and search well all around, and treat it as is necessary, until it is perfectly healed.
There are many kinds of nuts, of which I will describe all the similarities;
And now it is necessary that I describe all the difference that is between a nut and an issue.
I say that an issue is a persistent heat and fever, until the ebullition is past, and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and heat subside.
With a nut there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a syfac, which is its own sac and is according to the color of the body, and begins like a boil, and grows large;
and are according to two appearances, either greasy or moist, and many are in color as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of the nut, that you first examine and inquire with the instrument that is called "entromissoire", according to what its form will be in the chapter which follows.
And the manner of the examination of abscesses is that you take the moistest place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then that it be according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the entromissoire, and take care what comes out.
If running moisture flows, what color it has, then treat it as I have said of other abscesses;
and if after the entromissoire no moisture comes, know that it is hard, then treat it in a cross, and take it with pincers, and lightly scrape it on each side and guard the skin where it lies that you remove it healthy with the nut;
and if you cannot remove it whole, then remove it in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the nut returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, then fill the wound with some corrosive powders, and clean the wound, and apply soothing things to the warm abscess, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the nut is large, sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which generates flesh.
and if the beating vein is contrary to you or otherwise hastens you, and fill the place with ground vitriol, and let it sit two or three days, until the wound festers, and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to cut what remained of the nut.
Here are the forms of the instruments used, and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small;
and there are three squares which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, for encircling the abscesses of fistulas;
and they are like the needles with which one sews sores, and are of yellow brass, or of iron, or of silver, and those which are yellow are worth more, and they are better proven with black lead for encircling the curves of fistulas;
and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the hooks are very similar, as you see here:
and there are hooks which have two curves of three kinds as well;
and there are hooks which have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are hooks which have two curves, and hooks of only one curve, and are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The heads of those with which one cuts are sharp, and there are some which do not cut except on one side, with which one scrapes the knots, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these intromittors, the blades are enclosed in handles, so that the patient does not feel them in the opening of abscesses;
and they are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them only in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in the armpits, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to a fig-tree splinter, according to this form, with which one stops blood: and one sometimes places it in the place which heals by cutting veins and arteries, and sometimes round, according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, until they resemble women's breasts;
and remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, must act according to this form from this line b. down to g.: then scrape the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then join the two lips of the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops and is softened by its size as happens in women, then split it in two places above, with two similar incisions; so that one is attached to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line b. to line g.; then scrape the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about sutures and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come under the armpits are kinds of hard scrofula where there are ribs, and there are some that contain moisture.
Those then which contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line b to line g: And when all the matter that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with an ointment suitable for this until it is healed.
And if the abscess is similar to scrofula, treat it as we have said in the treatment of scrofula, and if the wound produces matter, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is broken, and the skin above is healed, many times an abscess results, and the same happens with an inflamed vein and abscess;
and one recognizes it thus when it is due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a throbbing;
and when it is due to the vein, it is round and apparent externally;
and it is folly to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and in the neck and in many other places, and is very large. It is necessary then to choose the iron cure, and the one who is in charge must also choose, and in the one who has an arterial swelling, make an incision above the skin along its length;
then make the incision with the hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is exposed;
then place a needle underneath it, and make it pierce to the other side, and draw out the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then prick the place which is between the two ligatures with a lancet until the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is emptied;
then apply the treatment that heals well, until the ligatures fall off; then treat it with an ointment suitable for it, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is due to the incision of a vein, then you must hold in your hand as much of the abscess as you can with the skin, then place the needle under the place that you hold in your hand, and make it pierce, and let there be a double thread, so that you draw it out from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, with the ligature on one of the two sides at the two ends of the thread;
and if you fear that the thread will come out, then insert another needle with a thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and draw the threads out in four places;
then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the core and leave that which is tied;
then place a cloth moistened in wine and oil on it, then administer treatment with tents and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses occur in the artery and in the vein, abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured, or by excessive work, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and it is in many ways without pain;
and when it is squeezed hard, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin;
and it moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, or down or up, and that which is in the joints should not be cut with iron: by chance, a contraction might result; and that which is on the head or on the forehead, pierce the skin with a spatula.
and that which is on the head or on the forehead, pierce the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, lift it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it happens in the belly and nowhere else, and it is a disease that is called "fungus" because of its resemblance, and the root is thin, and the head large;
and there are small ones and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly which were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had thin roots, and were split, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
I cut them and found one weighing eighteen ounces, and the other six and a half, and the procedure in the incision is that you observe if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white and moist and of thin root; if so, cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery at hand.
if so, cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery at hand. For in cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the incision of the iron, take a well-made lead thread, and tie the growth with it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the growth, and it falls off without effort;
and if the roots are large, there is fear in cutting even for the belly, but you can well cut half of it, then cauterize it so that it does not return;
then cure the wound, and take care that you do not cut the small growth which is of a livid color and of poor feeling and of milky appearance.
For this is an infected abscess, and I will come to the treatment of canker later.
When the boil comes out, If the appearance of the boil comes from cauterization of a wound or a fissure of a fistula, and is on the belly and some of the boils come out, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from flatulence;
and if it is through the rupture of the fistula and by the exit of the bowel, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a light thing without pain, and appears from diverse exits. And if it is because of the exit of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with one's fingers it retracts, and then returns, and perhaps it is scarred, and increases greatly at the entrance of the bath and through hard work.
And if it is because of moisture, it is a light thing, and appears well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrain.
and if it is because of blood, then the abscess appears through these signs: large and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity; and if it is because of flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you observe if the appearance is because of the blood of the artery, or of the vein, or flatulence.
and if it is because of flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you observe if the appearance is because of the blood of the artery, or of the vein, or flatulence. Then you must leave the cure. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, because of the artery and because of the vein.
And if the appearance is because of the intestine or bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath, and lie completely straight, then bleed from the anus all around the buttocks; then instruct him to lie often between your hands, then go around the place you have bled with the whole spatula, then extend half of the abscess above with the whole large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the binding be secure;
then open the half of the abscess extended above the binding, and put your index finger there, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the binding, then untie it, and put the intestine outside of the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it with the hook, and cut away the excess;
and if the artery or vein opposes you, then go carefully around it, then return to your work and take two needles, and thread two strong threads, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross that you make pierce;
then bind the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh falls away by itself; or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place as is necessary, and close the wound.
of the cancer We have described in the division the types of cancer, and how one should work on it with medicines, and how one should avoid the iron cure;
and we say that cancer worsens in the marrow, and there is great caution in its cure, and the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where it can be excised, such as cancer that is in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, and it must be completely removed when it is in the beginning;
nor did anyone ever heal it before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you sometimes purge the patient of black bile;
then make him bleed if he has manifest repletion, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the procedure;
then apply your ointments to the ulcer, and shave it on all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow completely, and wipe the area well with your hand or something else, and if the flow of blood prevents you from incising the artery or vein, then cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it with other treatment until it is healed.
Of dropsy We have, I have said in the division, the appearances of dropsy, and in what manner the gathering of water is made, and the signs of each appearance, and the cure which is made by medicines, and that which is cured by iron:
and one should not touch with iron in these two appearances: that is to say, tympanites and hyposarcha, for it is a mortal thing;
then when you treat this appearance of dropsy which is called "eclites" with medicines, and the cure does not benefit, then see if the patient is weak, or if he has another illness than dropsy, such as fever and looseness of the bowels and similar things; do not touch it with iron, for there is doubt;
and if you see the patient of strong virtue, and he has no other illness than dropsy alone, and he is neither too young nor too old, then you must work thus: lift the patient straight up on your hands, and administer pressure to the belly, pushing the water to the lowest part of the pelvis, then take the spatumile espinous according to this form: And let it be sharp on two sides. pointed, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestine when inserted, and cannot injure it;
then see if the dropsy is located towards the intestines: if so, you must make three incisions above the buttocks, directly below the hip; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, let your incision be on the left of the buttocks, three fingers wide;
and if it is due to the spleen, let it be on the right, and it is not necessary that the patient lie on the incision lest the superfluities flow to that weak place;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it, and lift your hand with all the spatula between the skin and the fascia, as in skinning, to the amount of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the fascia until the spatula reaches the empty place, and that is the place of the water, then draw it out, and insert this instrument of which here is the form: And it is similar to a thin silver tube, and is of bronze or light iron, and has at the lower part one small hole; and on one side, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on another;
and the head is cut like a pen, and this is the form of the incision with which scribes cut the pen:
at the top is the handle, so that when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately descends on the instrument;
empty then the half or the third part, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die because of the resolution of his spirit of the soul, or he will fall into a faint, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the virtue of the patient signify, and his pulse;
then draw the instrument and retain the water, and it is retained immediately by the heart which stops the hole which is on the syfac, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then recommence with the instrument the next day, if you see the patient suffering that, and draw out a small quantity of water;
do this every day, and be careful not to err until there remains only a little water.
And if you doubt about the patient, and you leave too much water, cure him with a warm burial or sand, and by much sweating or bath and in the sun, and let him abstain from drinking; and cure him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its place.
Then it is necessary that it be pierced immediately with a very fine spatula according to this form:
then place in the opening a fine lead tube, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days; and when he wants to urinate, let the tube be removed, and let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes out will not leave it closed.
For one whose opening is small, it is treated with the lead tube, as we have said, so it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born who have the opening at the head of the penis, wherefore they cannot urinate unless they raise their penis upwards; and cannot procreate because the matter cannot reach the testicles, and this is a serious illness.
And the manner of the procedure is that the patient lies often on his back, then they hold the head of the penis and cut it like the shaft of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as is necessary;
and beware of the bleeding that often occurs there, and if it happens, stanch it with what stanches blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Often these albathes appear on the penis, and it is an unsightly appearance of flesh;
and there are malignant and non-malignant ones;
then you must take them with a fine hook, and cut and clean them all, then apply moistened cotton with Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the albathe is malignant, of a bad color and festering, then you must apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the albathe is on the surface of the penis, and part is inside the skin and part outside, then you must remove the albathe that is inside first; and when it is healed, then treat the outside.
For when you treat it together, the penis is not assured that it will not be pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and the testicle;
it is necessary to remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from the bark of pomegranates and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs, apply the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery helps in two ways at once: that is to say, to the flow of blood, and to the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, you must insert a lead tube into the urethra, and the patient should urinate through it;
and when the skin is tight around the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or which happens due to a wound or abscess, then you must scrape it with a sharp instrument, until the constriction is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is a severe case to treat this, you must scrape it with a spatula a little from the head of the penis and the skin;
then separate gently the two parts, and place a thin linen cloth moistened with cold water between them, so that it does not constrict again.
Circumcision is not the loosening of a continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this operation of our own will, and properly on infants, it is necessary that we perform the best work, and the easiest for healing.
I say that the ancients did not describe the circumcision of their children, for they did not use it in their law, and we have nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the greater part of the masters and surgeons who performed circumcision around Idal, and forcibly, and with a whole scalpel;
the heart fled, for there are two membranes, and perhaps one cuts the upper one and the lower one remains. Now it must be cut, and the pain is doubled, and for the cleansing which is of the Idal, the tip of the member is not secure;
and in the cleansing of the nail, perhaps the iron slips, and the work is spoiled, and often they are born thus that they have no need of cleansing and I have seen it.
Of the cleansing which is done forcibly with the whole linen thread have I found the goodness of the experiment, for the forceps cut as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, you cut equally in one single time; but that the thread be well tight around the skin;
and the manner of the first operation is such that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then make him happy in every way that you can;
then make him stand straight between your hands, and place the forceps between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand to the penis and blow on the heart, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis is inside; then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then bind the marked place with a double thread, then bind it below, one little knot to another knot;
then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then bind the marked place with a double thread, then bind it below, one little knot to another knot; and hold it with two fingers for the second hour at the little finger and the index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the heart and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, for that is the best; and put powder on, and on the powder a cloth glued with a cooked egg white tempered with rosewater, prepared with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The form of the forces for the cleansing is this:
the two ends should be sharp and cutting, and the ends should be as large as the handle equally:
The error of the cleansing is when the core inside escapes during the incision;
then you must spread it with your fingernail, before the place forms an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then hold it with tongs, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and what is under the penis is swollen, leave it until the swelling of the abscess is subsided, and lightly scrape it;
cut it as much as you can move, and protect the part of the penis, this will not harm it at all.
Then treat the place of the wound with drying powders, which we have mentioned in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts beyond the core and it goes to the top, it will not harm.
then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Of the retention of urine
The retention of urine is from obstruction by stone, or congealed blood, or feces, or dead flesh, or similar things, which we have mentioned in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone which is in or near the neck of the bladder, then the patient must be bent over his knees; and his feet placed on his back, and he extends his belly from the upper part of the back, and the patient holds his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constricted to express the stone upwards, wherefore the urine is released;
and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the form:
and let it be of fine silver, lightly feathered, like a bird's feather; and let the tube be a palm and a half long, and let it be slender at the end.
And the manner of drawing out the urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a bit of wool or cotton to the end, and put the end of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut off the excess wool and put it up to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and anoint the bladder and penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then bend the penis upwards towards the belly;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it reach the empty space, and this is not done in this order except because the passage where it goes is twisted;
then pull the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out forcefully, and let the urine flow;
and repeat with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When abrasions or blood appear in the bladder, or corruption gathers there, and you want to instill waters and medicines, do so with the instrument called a “clepsydra,” and this is its form:
It is closed, and it has three openings: two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the head through which the medicine flows should be such that it well stops the penis without addition, so that one can draw out the moisture, and insert it when needed;
and when you want to pour your medicines into the bladder, put the head of the instrument into the moisture, and draw with the tube that is inside;
you will draw the moisture with the instrument, and then forcefully push the tube back inside; then the moisture will enter, and will immediately reach the bladder, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysterizes the bladder:
And it is of silver or of tin, and the head is higher;
and below there is a tube where the liquid falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you wish to clysterize the bladder, then tie it firmly between the two tubes with a good double thread, and slightly heat that liquid over the fire;
then put the end of the clyster into the penis, then squeeze your hand on the bladder with all the liquid gently, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it roundly all around; then put a strong thread in these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a bowl, and put inside what you wish of oil and liquid and water, and tie it onto the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have already spoken in the division of the types of stone, and their extraction along with medicines;
and I have described the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and which stone one should operate on by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you clearly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder happens more often to children, and it is a sign that the urine leaps from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety;
and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down many times, and then becomes stiff; and the anus often leaps with many of these.
and the healing of children is easy until they are four years old, and it is very difficult in the elderly, and it is moderate in young people, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have a large stone than for those who have a small one.
And when we come to the cure, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to remove all the feces that are in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and lift and move him downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes protrudes from the high place;
then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downwards;
then seek and touch it inside;
If you feel the stone in the space, hasten now to cut into the stone.
And if it does not fall completely to the touch, moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a fully grown youth; and put it into his rectum, and seek the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press with your finger, and push it to the outside where you wish to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to raise the testicles with his right hand, and with his left hand remove the skin that is under the testicles in the area where the incision is made;
then insert the cutting spatula, of which this is the form: And cut between what is between the testicles and the rectum, not in the middle but on the left side of the scrotum;
and it should be directly over the stone, and your fingers should always be at the rectum, and the incision should be transverse so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps press with the finger that is at the rectum, so that it comes out without difficulty;
and know that there are such stones which have angles and edges: then it is difficult to remove;
and there are some that are smooth, similar to an acorn, and round, whose removal is easy.
Therefore, for one with angles and edges, make a larger incision;
and if it does not come out, then you must pull on it with forceps which are like a file at the head, to move the stone so that it does not escape; or you place underneath it a thin instrument curved at the head;
and if you cannot extract it thus, slightly widen the opening, and if the blood flows, staunch it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, place the largest first at the neck of the bladder, then cut above, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be sawn, and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine constantly escapes because the wound cannot heal;
but nevertheless strive to pull it out, or break it with tongs, until you extract it in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it, and place over it a cloth moistened in oil and wine, or in oil and rosewater and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then raise the patient's head, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, wash the area very well with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses and corrosions occur in the wound, and blood clots in the bladder, and the urine is retained because of this, which is known in such a way that blood comes out with the urine: then put your finger in the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains there, it will run to the bladder, and rot it;
then cleanse the wound with water, vinegar, and salt, and help it in every way you know, until it is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat it, you bind the two thighs together, and apply the medicines to the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the passage of the penis, and stuck inside, and the urine cannot come out; then treat it as I said before, that you cut it many times, and one is excused from the incision by this treatment. I have already proven this so.
Take an iron drill according to this form and let it be with three angles fixed in a firebrand:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot go back into the bladder;
then put the drill into the penis lightly, until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill with your hand on the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is inside the penis. Then it is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is healed;
and if you cannot do this because of anything that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis towards the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
It rarely happens that a stone is generated in women, and if it happens sometimes, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things:
one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will uncover herself to the physicians, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-skilled in this art nearby;
and the fourth reason is that the stone in the woman is deeper than the stone in the man, wherefore it requires a deeper incision, and there is great fear. And if necessity demands it, then you must take a skilled female physician, and one hardly finds them, and if you do not find one, in no way seek a chaste, subtle physician;
and present to her a wise woman skilled in the life of women, or a woman who knows a part of the art, and instruct her to do what you command her concerning the examination of the stone; and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin:
and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, she should compress it beneath her finger, and instruct her to put her finger into the vagina of the patient, and press her left hand strongly upon the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it reaches the root of the thigh;
then cut above the stone at the root of the thigh towards the middle of the vagina, where it is usually situated, and feel for the stone in that area; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the initial incision be small;
and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the initial incision be small; then insert the instrument into the incision; if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound so that the stone may come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those which have branches.
so know their characteristics to know the outcome.
And if the blood overcomes you, put crushed vitriol on the spot, and hold it for an hour until the bleeding is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I have told you about in the extraction of stones from men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, put the powder on the spot and restrain it with tents and bandages, and do not begin that again, and leave the stone and do not extract it, lest by chance the patient die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is subsided, and the place is healed, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white humour, which is under the skin of the scrotum, that contains the testicle;
and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is properly in the membrane of the testicle, so that one thinks that it is another testicle; and that is the skin of the scrotum between the white humour that we have mentioned;
and this happens rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and that matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: or it is a color tending towards jaundice, or it is without redness, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs to know this collection, for if it is in the white fascia that we have mentioned, the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because there is moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the proper tunic, the abscess is round with part of the testicle, and therefore it is thought to be another testicle;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white fascia, one feels it well;
therefore when you wish to know the color of the moisture, test it with the entirely small probe, of which the form is shown above. According to that then which comes after the probe, judge that which is within.
And when we treat it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his strength and the repletion of his body;
then lay him on his back, on something a little high, and put many cloths underneath him;
then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart above the testicles;
then take the lancet, and cut the skin of the scrotum along its length to near the handle, and let your incision be completely straight in separating the skin of the scrotum to the white fascia, and scrape it subtly according to your ability;
then pierce the fascia full of water with one large hole, and extract all the water, and then apply your ointments, and stretch the fascia upwards;
and do not touch the testicles themselves, but only the fascia; cut all or in pieces equally the side of it subtly, for if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the testicle jumps out during your work, replace it in its place when you have completed the work on the fascia;
then join the two lips of the scrotum with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, you must tie the suspensory vessels, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle with all the suspensory [ligaments], and extract the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if pus is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil; and put on top other wool soaked in wine and oil, and place it over the two testicles, and put over it doubled cloths, and bind it all with a linen bandage which is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with lint according to this likeness and let them be joined by sewing at the waist of the breeches, and one of the ends should reach from the buttocks to the back, and the other to the part of the groin;
and the other two ends over the two thighs, and let the whole bandage be gathered in the buckle of the breeches;
and sometimes this swelling is treated with cautery instead of an iron incision, and it is that you take a small, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and it should be heated as we have said, so that the white layer containing the water is uncovered;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that layer with the awl, and scrape it with this hot, small cautery:
And cut it in every way that you can, until you have removed everything;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this procedure is safer; and more careful to prevent bleeding, and gentler than cutting operations;
and if anything goes wrong, whether an abscess forms or bleeding occurs or something else, then treat what is wrong, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful and does not want to undergo this procedure because of its horror, then perform a perforation, as I tell you, and when you are certain by the signs we have mentioned that watery humor is present, have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with a spatula as wide as possible, and make the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the water may flow out;
then put cotton on the place, and bind it, and leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound is healed;
And if the linen cloth does not allow the water to escape from the wound opening, then you must insert a feather or the instrument with which one draws water from dropsies, the form of which is shown above;
and slightly widen the wound, and know that the water returns and collects after six months or thereabouts, and when it is collected as before, and thus the patient will spend his days.
Know that in the incision of this branch there is fear in several conditions, wherefore it seems to me better that it is left;
and I will tell you the procedure and the characteristics of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come in the body, and especially to the testicles; and that is by many causes.
That is to say, by an excess of sour and sharp humor, which is spread to the testicles, or from percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it finds no pain, and is a serious abscess;
and perhaps there are serious, dangerous, and stony abscesses, and of a livid color, and sometimes it comes from an artery, or from a vein swelling.
When it is from an artery, it is known by the disposition of a hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you must not touch it.
That which is made from a vein swelling is known by its disposition upon the pressing touch of the fingers, and one can well make an incision on this sort, and on the other flesh; and it is that you cut the core of the testicles, then extend the egg upwards, and draw the force from the white tunic, and free the suspensory ligament from all parts of the egg.
If the egg is already soldered with these neighboring flesh, then it is necessary that you draw out the egg, and cut it;
and if it is adherent to the tunic, or to that which is within the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that membrane, and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the flesh is in the posterior location, then it is necessary that you cut it all, and extract the egg, as we have said.
And when your work is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
This is an abscess enveloped in a covering similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;
and the treatment of this illness is almost as frightening as the one before, and yet we will tell you how to treat it, according to what the ancients did.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat, then put the suspensory of the testicles down to your fingers, with all the vessels that are close to the penis, and let the master hold them, and stretch them strongly;
then cut with a sharp, broad spatula across the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then scrape on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples;
then insert a needle with double thread, and tie it at the first place where the pus has come, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupt humors;
then cure the wound like the others where pus gathers, so that no vessel is cut that nourishes one of the testicles;
for by this no harm comes, and if pus comes to all the vessels, then it is necessary to draw the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this hernia is by the section that occurs in the peritoneum, or the distension on the belly in the groin area, because of which the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either of the peritoneum, or of the distension of it, and these two manners come from many causes:
or from percussion, or from jumping, or from kicking, or from lifting a heavy weight, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the distension of the peritoneum, is that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscess is even until towards the depth, because the peritoneum presses on the intestine.
And the sign is when it is from the section of the peritoneum, that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscess is diversely apparent, under the skin near, and this is because of the issue of the intestine and the body outside of the peritoneum.
And sometimes the intestines descend with the intestine, and are held in there, and cause the patient to suffer great pain, especially when it is pressed.
And in these iron treatments there is fear, wherefore it is necessary to avoid them.
And the manner of the work is that you instruct the patient to push the intestine back in with his hand into the wound, if he can return it there; then let it be supported on its neck, between your hands, and raise the thighs;
then extend the scrotum upwards, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then insert into the lips of the wound hooks as much as you need to open the wound, and let it be such that the egg can come out;
then peel the fascia that is under the skin of the testicles, until the white hard fascia is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white fascia which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second fascia, and separate that which is behind the egg, and between the second fascia;
and then move with your right hand into the middle of the testicles, and stretch the white fascia upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with all the fascia towards the groin; and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards, and untie that which is behind the ligature;
and search with your fingers if there is any intestine wrapped in the hard white fascia, and if you find anything, then put it back into the abdomen below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten threads, and insert it into the back part of the fascia, which is behind the skin of the testicles; after the waist, then cut the ends of the threads that appear, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the fascia, which we have said is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong ligature of two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them firmly on two sides, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter into them, so that no abscess forms there; and put the ligature again according to the first ligature along two fingers of it, and after these two ligatures leave of the fascia which is under the skin of the testicles the breadth of a finger; and afterwards all the rest according to the roundness that the testicle has;
then cut in the part which is under the skin of the testicles, until the blood flows, and the bowel, as we have said above;
then apply wool soaked in oil, and put it in the wound, and apply the ligature that we have described. And sometimes the white fascia that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding. For this happens many times, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, let it be rinsed with warm water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with other treatments, until it is perfectly healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this branch I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is made like the branch that is next to the vein, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after cutting above or slightly below;
then cut in half, and treat the abscess with those who work, until the vessels dry up;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the angles, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend to the testicles, and if some do descend, it is little, and returns every hour;
and yet if it remains too long at this point, the wound or abscess grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens by the stretching of the sheath which is at the angles, as we have said, for it is stretched, then the place is softened and swollen and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture lengthwise to the extent of three fingers;
and then draw out the sheath which is under the skin that follows it, then take the root and put it on the apparent place of the sheath;
and press it to the depth of the belly, then sew the two apparent places of the sheath over the head of the root, and sew one and the other;
then draw out the head of the root, and do not cut the sheath nor stretch the egg nor anything else, as I have let you know in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then cure it by the treatment of wounds.
then cure it by the treatment of wounds. And when you cut the threads, then cleanse and treat the wound until it is healed.
The sheath is constricted, and there is no appearance in the rupture, and the cautery is milder in this place, and closer to salvation.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is unpleasant to see;
and it is necessary, when one wishes to cure it, that one makes the patient lie on his back, and cuts the softened skin over the natural skin;
then bring the two edges together with a suture, and if you wish, first sew the excess of the softened skin with three or four stitches firmly;
then cut between the stitches, and cure it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the thread is removed.
Of castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and for that reason I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the surgeon knows how to respond when asked, and knows the treatment;
and the other, because we often need to castrate certain animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by pulling, or by cutting.
In that which we do by pulling, we make the animal sit in warm water until the testicles are softened and hanging; then grasp them in your hand until they are retracted and you no longer feel them.
Of castration by cutting: you must hold the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut each testicle with one cut, when you have properly skinned them;
and leave some of the tunica vaginalis and the delicate membrane which is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than that which is done by traction, because with traction, by chance, some part of the testicles remains, wherefore the animal desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
Of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is, according to two manners, in men: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the figure of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other manner is in women, and she has above the vulva something like a penis and two testicles.
And the cure for the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and cure it like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men whose urine flows through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tetanus is a flesh added to the natural part, so much so that it is very ugly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the cure.
It is necessary that you hold the superfluity of the tetanus in your hand or with tweezers, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, lest bleeding occur, then cure it with another cure until it is healed;
and another flesh that grows at the mouth of the mare, and fills it, and perhaps jumps out, and is like a wart, and therefore the ancients called it "wart disease". Then you must cut it, as we have said of the tetanus, and cure it until it is healed.
Erratic is when the woman's nature is not pierced, or the opening is small; and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come there;
and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come there; or it is by added flesh, or by thin or thick scar tissue, and is made deeply in the womb, or on the sides, or underneath, or wherever it may be;
and prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps the having of flowers (menstruation);
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the vagina.
If the swelling is close and apparent, I search with my fingers or a probe.
If it is of thin scar tissue, and it is close to the two lips, hurry, and break it thus:
put your two index fingers together, and the woman should be on her back, her legs spread;
then stretch the two lips widely, until the thin scar tissue is broken, and the swelling is opened;
then take wool, and moisten it in oil, and put it on the place, and let the woman lie with a man each day, so that it cannot heal.
And if the scar tissue is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If the swelling is of raw flesh, then suspend it with a hook and cut it;
and have styptic medicines, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, together with egg white;
then administer a wide lead tube, so that the wound cannot heal;
and so it should be for a long time, and administer a tent of dry linen;
then it should be treated with other treatments until it is healed.
And when new flesh grows in the wound, it must be cut in this manner, unless it is an infected abscess. For an infected abscess which is in the wound, one should not touch with fire.
of the hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood often flows, and when hemorrhoids are old they become swollen;
and we have already mentioned in the division the similarities of them, and the signs, and I will say here those which receive treatment.
I say that hemorrhoids and the swelling, when they are deep in the wound and do not appear to the touch, are not cured by iron.
Those which are at the opening of the wound, which one can feel, are those which one can cure.
It is necessary then that you place the woman in a cold house, then grasp the swelling with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle on medicines that constrict blood, such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things;
then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then place her in cold water;
and if bleeding occurs, make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster of it and put it on her back.
And if it stops, that is good. If not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts without causing injury;
then take wool, and moisten it in plantain juice or agrimony juice with old wine, and apply it to the place.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the place with ointment until it is healed;
and that which is called "albathir" is red, and is similar to a rough head, so it must be cut as I have described the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses arise in the sea, such as cancer and stony abscess and herpes and esthiomenes and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and many other diseases that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary then that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which comes in the sea, which is not of the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you wish to know the work of iron, see if the abscess is acute at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it. Then do not hasten to pierce, but let it mature until the pain is calmed;
and then make the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats on which he leans, and rests on his back and brings his feet together towards the outer parts of the leg;
and let his thighs be spread, and put his arms under his knees, and bind them well with a good binding;
then suck him towards the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the abscess, of which the shape follows;
and it is necessary that when you see this instrument administered, that you first insert the rod to know the depth of the abscess, so that what enters of the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is larger, it is necessary to cover the depth of the abscess with cloths, so that the instrument does not harm it;
and it is necessary that he put the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess opens, and one opens it with a soft hand, then it is necessary to cut it at the head, with a spatula;
and when the abscess is emptied, it is necessary that you put in the wound tents soaked in rose oil, or in dry verdigris oil;
and put the tent deep into the wound to the bottom of the abscess, and put on the outside of the abscess and on the wound clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been cooked;
then cure it after two days with an ointment suitable for this, until it is healed;
and sometimes one cleans the abscess and the wound with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water in which lily roots and long birthwort have been cooked; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep in the abscess, then you must be careful not to cauterize with iron, but cure it as we have said in the division.
of childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife to know the form of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing downwards, and desiring to defecate:
then the child hastens to come out; then know that that childbirth is according to the natural form, and the birth is head-first, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, it is necessary to press lightly on her belly, so that the child comes out quickly;
for when it descends head-first, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its superfluities by good cleansing;
and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For sometimes it comes feet-first, and the body or the head and hands come out, or it comes on its belly, or sideways, and is turned perhaps on its neck, and by other bad positions;
it is necessary for the midwife that she be wise and skillful in these things, and guard herself from error and deception, and I will show you all the positions how one should help her.
If the child comes head-first by natural birth, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, then make her sit on a saddle, or have the women hold her;
and raise her naturally with oil or fenugreek that has been cooked, and then let the midwife put between her fingers the small spatula of which here is the form: and split the afterbirth, and cut with her nail until the moisture that is inside runs out;
and grasp the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with linseed oil;
then make her sneeze and cough with sneezing powder, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will come out immediately.
And if the two hands come out, you must gently reset them little by little; and if they cannot be put back in, have the woman sit on a seat, and raise her feet; then put the seat down on the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall when it is lowered;
and if the hands cannot be put back in, and the child dies, cut the hands with the knife that is mentioned before, and extract the child, and reset it equally.
of the delivery of the child on its feet When the child comes on its feet, it is necessary to push it upwards; and then turn it little by little, until it is even;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it comes down to the thighs, one should grasp it and make it sneeze with a suitable [substance]; then it jumps out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is according to its natural form. For then it comes out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take mallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and melted gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and put it on the woman's genitals and apply this ointment, then make her sit in warm water up to the ribs;
and when she is softened underneath, make her a pessary of myrrh, and put it underneath, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and clear her mouth and nose, and gently press her belly, for the child will come out immediately.
from the delivery of the child onto her knees When the child comes in this way, the midwife should put her hands in little by little; then let it be supported at its neck, and its feet hang down, and let it lie on a bed; and fold its hands little by little, and then take its hands onto its belly, and remove the cushions from underneath, until it is positioned downwards; and if the child does not jump, take its feet and move them strongly, then move its belly upwards, then put your hands in; and draw out the child little by little; and instruct the woman to strain until the child comes out.
of the delivery of the child who comes from the womb with one hand hanging down It is necessary to devise a way to bring back the hand: if one cannot bring it back, then have the woman stand and walk;
if she cannot walk, then have her lie on the bed, and spread her legs widely;
then administer the mucilage that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, then have her sit on a seat, then work to bring back the hand; and draw out the child according to its natural position, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes out.
of the child's exit over its neck, and with its hands outstretched, and its face turned towards its mother's back it is necessary that the midwife hold its hand, then turn it little by little, and draw it out gently;
and when they are even, then apply to the area a poultice of mallow and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, then have her sit on a seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner with all the afterbirth
in this same manner with all the afterbirth When it comes out in this manner with all the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your fingernail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs on its face and neck, cut it from the belly so that it is not retained, and the child dies;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as it should be, and instruct the woman to take herself sometimes:
Of the delivery of twins Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born; and that is not a strange thing, and it happens little. Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except few by name;
Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except few by name; I know that, that they are multiplied, and are separated by the syfac which divides them, which is attached to the navel;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single one, as we have said.
And if they come out badly, treat it as we have said, and let the dressing be subtle, and do quickly and lightly what it does; and do as it seems best for healing. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb, one or two or three or four or five or six or seven, or more up to fifteen, and are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the wise and glorious, and the dresser must know all this, for by chance similar things happen; so do according to what is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in her womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained by the work of hands; it is necessary that you know if the woman is of sound virtue, and has no accident or fear of death;
it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back, and her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised;
and the assistant hold her, or she be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled during the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mallow and fenugreek mucilage and linseed, then let the midwife oil her hands with these oils and mucilages;
then she inserts them into the womb lightly, then she seeks a place where she inserts the fingers that are suitable for this, and takes care if the child is positioned to descend head first;
then she inserts her fingers into its eyes or its neck or its mouth or its palate or under the chin or in the clavicle or near the ribs, and if the descent is feet first, she inserts them into the heel and the middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the finger with his right hand, and place the curvature between the fingers of his left hand, and insert it with his whole hand gently, and insert the finger into any of these places that we have mentioned, until he reaches the empty thing;
then insert another finger opposite, or a third if you need it, so that the extraction is even;
and then extend it equally, moving from one side to the other, to allow the thing to come out, and let the fingers be toothed to hold the thing, as the shape is here:
And if a part remains, let him lubricate some of his fingers with oil, and insert them into that part, and pull out the other part;
and if some still remains, put this finger in a higher place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and he cannot bring it back because of the tightness, then you must wrap it in a cloth, until it all comes out; then cut it at the joint of the sole or at the heel, and thus you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
And if the head of the child is large and it is narrow at the exit, or it has an acute collection of fluid in the head, then you must put the spatumile espinous between your fingers, and split the head and draw out the water; or you round it with the instrument that is called "almidach", the shape of which will be shown with the instruments in the chapter that follows this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with tongs, and if the head jumps out and is extracted with the forceps, let it be split, until the moisture that is in the worst part comes out;
and if it cannot come out, then cut it into pieces as best you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it until the moisture flows out.
And if the child is on its feet, the extraction is easy, and the straightening at the mouth of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or chest, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and slit the belly or chest until the moisture that is there flows out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the midwife puts her hand into the depth of the womb, and draws it out to the mouth of the womb; then puts in one or two fingers, and pulls it forcefully;
and if the mouth of the womb is constricted because of a hot abscess that has formed there, then one must not work there, but rather apply moist and greasy things; and apply plasters, and sit in softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it straight, then apply what we have said in the case of a living child;
and if one cannot, then pull it out forcefully piece by piece, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then apply what we have said for hot abscesses that occur in the womb;
and if a flow of blood comes, let it be placed in astringent water, and apply other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had been dead, then another was conceived on top of that one, and the other was also dead. After a long time, an abscess came to her in the groin, and it swelled until it opened, and began to greatly fester.
I was called to treat it, and I thought about it for a long time, and I could not heal the wound.
I applied a plaster of strong attraction, and a bone came out, and after some days another. I was very surprised, because there are no bones in the womb.
So I thought that it was the bones of a dead child.
I cleansed the wound, and extracted more bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time like that, and a little pus always came from the place;
and I have only included this chapter because, when a master finds something strange, he should know how to provide help.
Then comes the form of the press, with which one binds the books;
and with two turnings at the two heads of the two bands. However, the horns should be finer than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the shaft should be one finger wide, and the edge of the branches one finger, and one and a half palms long; and between the two bands should be two additions of this same wood, which are fastened in one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the trepan to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar but finer and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, similar to tongs; and have at the two ends two additions, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you wish to open the trepan with the whole instrument, make the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down and her legs open, then insert the two additions fitted together into the trepan, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then work your hand with the whole instrument, as you did with the tongs equally, according to the amount that you want to open the mouth of the trepan, until the opening does what it should.
These instruments are all surpassed, and their forms are multiplied; and when the surgeon has prepared them, the work is so much faster, and more useful to men because of their quantity.
Do not disdain the instrument until you have prepared it, for its necessity is not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained in childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a potion, and press your hands to her mouth and nose; and if she expels it thereby, it is well.
If not, take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia lignea, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in water in the pot over the fire;
then put one end of a tube in the hole of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the womb, and hold it until the vapors enter the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. If the secundines (afterbirth) come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to moisten her left hand in sesame oil or in mallow poultice, and then put it into the vagina, and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, let her take it and extend it little by little gently, so that the womb does not fall during extraction;
but it should be moved lightly to the right and to the left, and then pulled out; then it will come and will be delivered.
And if the mouth of the womb is too constricted, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing, and of herbal fumigation;
and if it does not come out from all that we have said, be careful not to be hasty in pulling;
but it is necessary that what is at the mouth of the womb, you tie it to the thigh of the woman, then clysterize it with tetrafarmacon ointment; then it will rot and soften, and come out.
However, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Then suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
Some of the ancients have tested a fumigation of cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is of glass, similar to a funnel, and one puts the thin end into the vagina, and the wide end over the fire;
and let the fumigation be on the coals, and burn it until it is consumed, and begin again with another.
Many children are born who do not have the rectum pierced, but it is stopped up by a thin membrane: therefore it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and guard the wound so that she does not touch it;
then put on wool moistened in wine and oil, then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will close up again, put a lead tube in the opening, and leave it there for several days, and let it be removed when the child wants to go to the toilet.
And sometimes this blockage comes from a sudden wound or abscess; then it is necessary to cut that blockage: then it should be cured, as we have said of the lead tube.
Fistulas which come from under the fundament are knots and swellings which come near the fundament from the outside, or in the space between the two parts, then there is one fistula or several;
and when that knot is old, it works, and moreover moist, white or subtle pus oozes out, and sometimes these fistulas are perforating;
and are known because from them there issues pus or flatulence when the patient evacuates, and by chance a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas which pierce as far as the bladder, and as far as the middle of the penis; and reach as far as the joint of the thigh, and as far as the buttock.
And thus one knows the perforating fistula at the fundament, and not the non-perforating: and it is that you insert your index finger into the fundament, and insert a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, then insert a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or the hair with your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and there is no excretion, flatulence, or worm coming from the opening, as we have said: know that it does not perforate; then hasten to cure it.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary duct, urine escapes from it, and it cannot be healed by medicines.
If it is pierced as far as the hip joint, the tent is placed reaching to the location; if there is no tortuosity and the origin of the pain is around, it is so that pus constantly comes out of it, and neither medicine nor healing by ointment helps;
and in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure except labor, and the vanity of foolish physicians who meddle with them.
In that which is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope of healing by iron, as I have experienced, and it is so that the patient lies on his back between your hands;
and raise his legs up to his thighs, and have his thighs inclined towards his belly; then insert a tent of bronze, or of lead if there is tortuosity, until you know where the tent goes.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, then you must put your index finger there, if you then feel that the tent has pierced it;
and it is uncovered where you feel between your finger the pus or the flesh, then know that it is penetrating; if you do not work at it, it cannot be healed.
It is said however that some can be healed, but this happens rarely;
and the help that is done there, is that one heats the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as it is said before; and puts it very hot into the fistula, until it reaches near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that the rotten flesh is burned, which is similar to a bird's feather;
and then treat it with tents moistened in butter, until that rotten flesh comes out, then treat it with ointment that generates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, it cannot be healed otherwise;
and if the tent enters, and does not pierce to the finger which is in the bottom, and there is between your finger and the tent a thick covering of flesh or of a membrane, and you see the fistula at that which follows the covering of the heart; then cut from the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward, and then cauterize afterwards, until it reaches the end of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and will fall;
then cleanse those rotten fleshes that resemble a bird's feather, and let nothing remain.
And if the blood overcomes you, and runs between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
For fire cautery combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added fleshes, and the stanching of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat it with tents moistened in butter or in crushed herbs, until the place throws off pus, and the burned flesh comes out in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that suppurate,  healing hard flesh, and the medicines are dry.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula goes down to the bottom of the fundament, and is far from the body, put your finger in the fundament and search for it.
If you feel the tent, and between the two is the web or the membrane or flesh, or it is about to pierce, there should be no fear but hope and confidence, through the use of one of three methods:
either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, put tents there and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the ligament that holds the fundament, and an evacuation occurs against the will. Then treat it, as we have said;
Then treat it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it after it is cut near the fundament, either with a tent or another pointed instrument; then cleanse that corrupted flesh which is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound, and to leave the fistula in the part outside the fundament:
then strive to restore the wound, and to leave the fistula in the part outside the fundament: that will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are in this manner: and it is when you place the tent in the fistula, and it is on the side of the fundament near the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the end according to this form: And put a twisted thread in it, and put the tent with the thread into the fistula until it reaches the end.
If it is perforating in the margin of the fundament inside, then pull the thread from that hole, so that you put your finger into the fundament;
and pull the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and pull one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between the two, and they come together;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in every way that you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to cut so deep for the laceration, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spinous spatula with which one cuts the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are inside the fundament, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they constantly bleed, and there is one or more, and they are outside the fundament and at the end of the fundament;
but those which are outside have little moisture, and constantly a little citrine water or a little blood, and have the color of the flesh;
and the cure of those who have them inside the fundament, is that you instruct the patient to strain to go to the chamber, until the fundament comes out, and the threads appear; then hurry, and grasp it with tongs, or hold it with your nail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, then take them with a cloth, or cotton, or a piece of camlet; and extract them with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle on some hot powders which are in place of a cautery; or you cauterize them as is said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed;
and if the matter cannot come out, then give the patient a clyster of a biting and harsh clyster to wash that which is in the fundament, so that it may come out clearly; when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy;
when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy; and it is that you take them with your fingernail or with tongs, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and that it avoids incision by iron. Then you must administer the suture according to this manner:
Then you must administer the suture according to this manner: take I twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then draw the thread above and make the needle pierce on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and pull the thread tightly, then knot the thread, and withdraw the needle, and do so for all the others, and leave I to drain the excess blood;
then place on the wound a cloth moistened in rose oil or in cerate, and place it on the wound, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they have fallen off, then treat them with ointment and other treatment, until they are healed.
of the drying of the fistula or wound Often there is drying of the fistula in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the disease is old and medicine is of no use. Then you must scrape with the point of a spatula or your nail the surface, so that it does not leave it moist; then treat it until it is healed as it should be;
and if it cannot heal, then begin scraping more strongly than before, until it is very healthy, and is scraped; then treat it until it is healed.
of the trembling Formication is a small, crawling sensation around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes it finds it cold, and it is felt as if dead from trembling, and it comes in the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and put that quill on the trembling, until the circle encompasses the trembling entirely; then turn your hand with the entire quill until you cut all around the trembling, and put it deep, and pull out the trembling from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a quill of bronze or iron according to this form, and let it be thin below and thick above: not pierced, to better hold with the finger, and better press.
And if you wish, cauterize the trembling, as is described in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or of pewter, or of molten or hammered bronze;
and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those then which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small.
Those then which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is wider above, where the belly is tied in this manner:
and there is a release where the belly is tied, as you see, and the end is pierced within;
and has on one side two holes, and on the other one;
and let the belly, where one puts the medicines, be of an animal bladder or parchment, and let it be pierced all around with small holes, and let there be one finger's breadth of space between each hole, then put in these holes one strong thread of raw thread twisted in an X or around, and gather the belly like a goat's; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then clysterize;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the minister presses it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then withdraws the clyster, and the patient raises his legs against the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps a whole night, it is greater help.
And if you clysterize him for a disease of bowel looseness, and the medicine hastens to come out, repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as fine as for a child;
and this is the form of the fine clyster on which the skin is stretched:
We have already said in the division the treatment of wounds;
now we will tell the cures by hand and by medicine, according to the completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and from what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throw of a stone, and the cut of a sword and of a knife, or of a lance or of a stick or of an arrow, or of similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the foot, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the cure of each wound, and I will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, then take care if it is from the throw of a stone or similar things, and the skin is still broken and the wound is large, and you doubt the rising of a hot abscess: then make it bleed at once from the cephalic vein, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side from the injured part;
and let the patient avoid repletion of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be lessened, and let him drink no wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if hot abscesses come there, cotton moistened in rose oil only, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not moved by the air, the powder, which I will describe a little later;
and if the burning has moved it, put on some ointments, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, such as from a sword cut and similar, and the lips cannot be brought together by tents, bring them together by suture, as I will describe for wounds of the belly, of the suture.
If the wound is laid open to the bone, and hangs, and holds only by a little, cut it; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat strong foods, such as heads and cooked wheat, also such as poultry, and similar things.
And if you find corruption in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, cut away all the corruption, and throw it away, then treat it;
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, seek the artery, and if you find it loose, tie it with a thread; and if that does not help, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the cure is easy: and it is that you put in this powder which heals before the fire has moved it.
And the manner of the powder is: take incense, one part; dragon's blood, two parts; quicklime, three parts, and powder it finely, and apply to the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it untied, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one uses only lime, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but that the burning does not move the wound.
And if the burning has moved the wound, especially in summer, then one does not put this powder there;
but apply some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it throws off pus; then cure it with other cures until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, extract it with fine forceps;
and I will tell you later about head fractures.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and one on the head, but if the neck nerve or artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it to heal, and not to apply anything constricting, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and not to put anything cold on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their connection is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be warm, such as warm washings in fresh water, and mixed with rose oil, and cooked herbs also washed in fresh water, and other minerals in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, pierce it in the lowest place;
and if the artery is cut, and a flow of blood comes from it, tie it off, and bind it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the gullet is cut, or the heart, and the passage is guarded, by which the flesh goes, sew the heart to the gullet, and do not touch the gullet but restore it according to its natural shape; and then bind it properly, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, search it; and if there are pieces of bone, pull them all out if you can, and those that you cannot reach, leave them until the wound festers, and the exit is opened and cleansed;
and if the wound is fresh, sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a blow from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, see if wind escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not apply powder at the first hour, nor bind it up, lest the blood remain within, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you have no ointment, put old cotton in the wound to soak up the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; thus there will come no spasm, nor tremor, nor evil heart-constriction, nor shortness of breath; and when you see good signs, know that the wound is healed. Treat it then with tents and other treatments, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and festers, know then that there is a fistula;
then treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, whether on the breast or back, treat it as one would treat the front; if it is large, with sutures;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it has reached the bone, and has cut pieces, clean the wound, and draw out splinters if they are detached; and if they are not detached, let the wound fester, this will ease extraction;
and for other wounds in other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are large, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, protrude, causing their insertion;
and the suture is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in, unless they are put back in immediately;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, they are more difficult to put back, and therefore the medium wound is better, because one more easily puts the intestine back in its place than the others.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common sutures occur in the suture of the belly, and the suture of other wounds of the body and two other proper sutures are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more proper with the suture of the belly, and I will describe each one and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put it back, this is by one of the two manners: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or boil it in water with squill and cypress and spikenard, and bathe the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes astringent wine does this, and is better than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling depart, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea and mallows have been boiled, for by this the entry is easily closed;
and if it cannot enter, then slightly enlarge the wound with the instrument with which one cuts hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, which one should not do without great necessity;
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
cut inwards into the curve and not outwards, and see here the form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, replace it according to its natural form in its proper place, if you are able, for this is worth much.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, then you must make the patient lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the lower part of the belly, place the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, then direct your attention to that the injured part be higher than the other;
and thus you must manage what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, place what you have prepared, then have in your hands a pitiful minister who holds the entire rupture with his hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common manner of sutures, and it is that you take one needle or more, according to the quantity of the width of the wound, then leave from the head of the wound one inch of space, and there stick a needle where there is a good strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the siphac, which is beneath the skin within, so that you make it pierce from that part, and bring together the two edges of the siphac, all four together;
then strain a double thread around the needle from two sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound evenly, and then leave one inch of space, and there stick another needle;
then tie the thread as you did the first needle, and do not cease doing this according to what you need of needles, until the entire wound is constricted;
and let the needles be medium, between fine and thick, for fine needles cut all the flesh, and the too thick ones cannot enter well: therefore it is necessary that they be medium;
and it is not necessary to push the needles too far from the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before the closing;
and then cut the ends of the needles, that they may not injure the patient in sleep, and put tents or small cloths at the ends of the needles to hold them, and leave them until the wound is closed;
and this method of suturing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles suffice.
The second suture is common, and is that you bring together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the muscle with a needle on which there is a strong medium thread;
and when you have pierced these four edges together, then return the needle to the part where you began, in the manner in which cloths are sewn;
and place between each suture the thickness of a little finger;
This suture is used by men, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm wide, and the intestines protruded well two palms wide, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I returned the intestine after it had been twenty-four hours outside, and the wound was healed until fifteen days, and I treated it, and it was healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle;
and I did not treat it with ointment, because I was in a place where one found none, nor any medicines; and I put clean cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper methods of suture:
Take the needle, and put it from the outer part to the inner;
when it has pierced straight through the heart, leave the head of the thread where you inserted the needle, and make it pierce from the other side, from the inner part to the outer;
and the method of this suture is that you sew as the furriers sew furs, and that you leave the thread on one side, and take it up on the other, until the suture is completely finished.
The second method of suture, which Galen properly describes, is as some do, who join the two parts together naturally, and apply one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle at the nearest end of the wound, and make it pierce that place only, and leave the two ends of the thread; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outer part to the inner, at the two ends of the thread;
then make it pierce each from the outer part to the inner, at two other ends of the wound which are on the other side;
and this is the easiest and most common method of suture.
Galen says this, and some testify to it, that one should sew the belly with two needles, with thread in each;
and one should insert one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the suture is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is like the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the heat has changed it, then replace the intestine, and sew it;
then put on the flesh-generating powder, and if the heat has changed it, then put on any ointment that is present, until the wound heals; and the threads are cut, and the membranes and the muscle are joined; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you do not have medicines, then put on, as soon as it begins to produce pus, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need other medicine in many cases when the wounds are simple;
and if you fear that the wound will affect the principal members, then you must moisten light wool in oil of temperate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the armpits, and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or corruption in the bowels, and this often happens, then clysterize them with warm red wine, and especially if the corruption reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small.
The intestine which is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is injured, and this is because of the abundance of veins that are there, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the intestine protrudes from the wound, put it back as with the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become green or black, then you must bind the area that is black, so that a flow of blood does not come there, for there are veins and arteries;
then cut what is between the ligature, and hang the two ends from the part below the wound to the outside to facilitate extraction when the intestine falls, and the wound heals.
Of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is broken, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly with a lance;
and the wound was on the right of the stomach, and was infected and became a fistula, and the excrement and wind issued from it;
I applied a cure according to my ability, and did not cease to refine it until he was healed, and the place was closed.
And when I saw it closed, I feared that the patient might have harm in his belly; and there was no harm, but he remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be tied in this manner: Take threads with large heads, then bring together the lips of the wound, and when the thread has opened its mouth, place it over the two lips, so that it tightens its mouth over;
and then cut off its head, and this holds so that it cannot come undone, then put another thread afterwards in the same manner as before, until the wound is completely closed; and sew the wound.
These ends are burned in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestine with a fine thread which is cut from the intestine of a beast, in this manner:
take the end of this intestinal thread that is very clean, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then put the thread in the needle, and sew the intestine, and return it to the rupture;
and this method of sewing with threads is not false except according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no device or knowledge, except subtlety.
of a fistula wherever it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes old, is universally called a "fistula", and especially when it is haired and discharges pus.
And a fistula is, in truth, a hard and white false knot, where one feels no pain, and is as hairy as a bird's feather;
and sometimes it discharges clear pus, and sometimes thick; sometimes little, and sometimes enough;
and I have spoken of it in the division of wounds, that every wound which is not healed, and there is no flesh, is only because of one of the nine causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the lips, which does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much swelling; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the cure; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because by the property of the region, digestion is slow, and healing is slow, and it swells by nature; or there are veins or bones there;
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Now it is necessary that I make you know the cure of a fistula which is made by the work of hands.
Know that a fistula occurs in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that occur in the large veins, and in the arteries, and in the nerves, or in the syfac, or in the intestine, or in the bladder, or in some of the ribs, or in the spine of the back, or in some joint of the hands or feet; and so there is one that comes to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this manner are of difficult healing, and there is nothing but labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not come to the place that I have said, and you have confidence in the cure, and you wish to know it, then take a tent of bronze or iron, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a thin tent of lead, for the lead bends easily around the tortuosity;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot search it well with tents, then irrigate it through one of the openings, for the moisture runs from one opening to another, and cleans it;
then search it wisely to your ability, that you may know if there is bone or nerve, and is it deep, and ask the patient well about the pain that he feels at the pressure of your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove the rotten matter and the corrupted flesh that are inside;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep and straight, then you must cut deeply, as much as you can, then put in moistened tents in healing medicine, and push them to the end of the fistula, until the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not hinder you in the principal members, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then remove it until all the corruption is gone, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns as before, know that you have not gone to the bottom:
then uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, it is well. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; then there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it out with tongs, then extract it with a suitable instrument for this, and if there are many bones, then extract them all, and leave not one;
and if the moisture hinders you, and there is no risk or fear, then cut away the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, then put something on the wound that induces putrefaction, and leave it until the area is rotten around the bones, and then the bones will come away more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, then only remove the corruption until all the blackness is gone, then restore the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; then it is necessary to cauterize and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take example from it and help in your work.
He was a young man of about thirty years, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that originated within the body, so that the materials came to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no external cause to open it;
but the physicians, through their folly, worked on it so much that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed from it, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared from which all expelled pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians treated it for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of surgery until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which he was treated, and what flowed through the holes in great quantity; and the young man's flesh became red, and had a yellowish color.
I placed a tent in one of these holes, and then I searched all the holes, and found that one led to another from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered part of the bone, and found it corrupt and perforated, and the corruption reached the bone inside;
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupt bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except that which I removed;
and I began to treat the wound with cauterizing medicines for a long time, and it would not heal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continued in the bone, and I probed it, and then removed it, and I strove to heal the place; but I could not, so that I cut around a hand's breadth of the bone, and removed it entirely with its marrow, then I treated it with medicines; and it was healed and closed quickly, and it was not necessary to begin the work again except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure it, and for the fear of death that I had for him. For because of the evacuation, he bled often, but he was healed entirely, and in place of the bone grew hard flesh, and it was of good disposition and had no harm or ill in any way, neither in walking nor in coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, then it must be treated in this manner: take a linen cloth, and bind it to the end of the bone which is exposed, and instruct someone to pull it upwards; and place another linen bandage, thicker than the first, and bind it over the flesh which is above the bone, and extend the head, so that you draw the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the flesh above the place where you wish to sew, so that the sewing does not injure the flesh;
and place a burning coal or a hot iron under the bone to cut away the corrupted flesh;
and it is necessary to sew as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and sew again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not appear, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then place a burning coal underneath, and then sew from one part to the other the corruption, and let the length of the sewing be a little longer than the corruption, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and sew the bone where it is held on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, then there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, this is a very serious matter, but nevertheless you must investigate this corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way that you can, but so that the vein or the nerve do not hinder you;
and know that the cutting instruments and the threads for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and their thinness, and their size and their smallness, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare for each type of work its instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the types of illnesses; so consider the instrument you need according to what is necessary.
The head rots either from an internal cause, or from an external cause;
and when you have treated that corrosion with the cure of medicines, and they do not help, then it is necessary to cut off that member up to the place where the corrosion comes, so that the patient escapes death by this, or by the greater harm of the loss of the member;
and the sign is that the member becomes black, so that it seems to be burned by fire, and rots after the blackness, then that corrosion goes from member to member, and takes over the whole body;
so hurry to cut, and if it is by the sting of some venomous beasts, such as sea scorpion and viper and the like, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it off, and do not give it space to come to the hand.
And if it comes to the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it comes to the arm, cut it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no remedies are of use except the quantity of its [the poison's] power;
and do likewise when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends in the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die;
and the manner of cutting or sawing the limb is that you bind it above and below, and one assistant stretches one of the bandages down, and another assistant the other bandage up, and you separate the flesh that is between the two bandages to a width of one finger, until the bone is uncovered;
then cut or saw, and place on each side a linen cloth, so that the saw does not touch the healthy area, and another lesion and abscess occurs to the patient.
And if profuse bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some styptic powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man in his foot:
a blackness befell him which resembled a burn from fire, and this corrosion first appeared on his toe, until it affected the whole foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off his foot, and was healed;
and a long time afterwards the corrosion returned to a finger of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied repelling things after the cleansing of the body, and the corrosion could not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hope of repelling the matter; and I also doubted that if I cut his hand, that he might die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have recounted this only so that one may do likewise, if one has need.
Sometimes an abscess comes in fleshy tissue, and remains so long that it forms a large collection of pus; and then it breaks and bursts, and the pus leaps out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin that is above is as thin as a fine cloth, and does not reach down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an ailment is called "Sain," and is not called "fistula";
but if it is so deep that it reaches the bone, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you cut that skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not heal because of its corruption.
And if you have confidence that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with a clyster thus:
see if the swelling is large, and the pus that comes from it is foul-smelling, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put it to cook in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and mix it in water and honey, and clysterize the swelling, and extract the pus; and leave the medicine inside for two hours, then extract it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the swelling is reduced, and the pus is removed;
and sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present, and it is that you take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over it, then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you know that the swelling is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey in which there is a little crushed litharge; or you clysterize it with honey and mead, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine makes the blood rise;
and when you have done this, and you have confidence that the swelling is well cleansed, then clysterize it with that which causes flesh to grow in it, and it is that you take diafinitis plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you clysterize it with certain medicines and ointments, of which I have spoken of the properties in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small, and the tube of the clyster cannot enter, then widen it with a little iron, and put in a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too wide, then sew it and leave only the place where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is above, then cut it in the lowest place that it is.
and if you cannot cut the swelling below as you wish, then prepare it in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest place that it is, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there and if you cannot cut the swelling below as you wish, then prepare it in this way: that the pus flows easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus flows easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidative medicines to put on the swelling, and extend over it a linen cloth that covers the whole swelling; then cut with force at the opening of the swelling a little larger than the first, then spread soft ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and place it over the opening of the swelling to drain the pus, and do not remove the large cloth outside except after many days once;
and the one that is over the opening of the swelling, remove often to remove the pus, and know what flows from the pus, if it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take care if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has spread in this way and you see the nature that rises above the opening of the swelling, know that the swelling will heal, and health is approaching;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health approaches.
For there are men whose flesh grows slowly in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
and if undigested pus bursts from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling will not heal;
and if the swelling is slow to heal, and is prolonged, add drying medicines moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as diaphinite ointment, for it contains a large part of vitriol, and this is the last medicine;
take diaphinite ointment, and it is made with rose oil, and rose of old wine equal in substance;
then cook it and use it;
and this same thing cooked thicker is better, when diaphinite ointment is not present, or you take myrrh and aloes and incense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey while it is over the fire;
and then glue a cloth to it, and spread it on the swelling, and sometimes aristolochia longa is administered, and roots of lily of the valley, which is like bean flour and centaury; and use it of simples or of compounds: grind them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey that I have mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this cure, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard members, or on the ligaments; then cure it with the cure of fistula, as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the little finger of the hand, or of the foot, or by chance arises in other fingers;
and when it is neglected, and one does not take care of it, then there comes a hot abscess, and it runs and throws pus until it reaches the root of the nail, and perhaps it destroys the whole nail;
and the corrosion reaches the bone, until there is foul-smelling pain, and the head of the finger is swollen, and the color is livid.
When you treat it as we have said in the chapter, and the treatment does not help, then you must cut away with an iron instrument all the excess that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is a great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses on the flesh and begins to prick and wound it, you must place a thin blade under the nail where it pricks the flesh, and lift it up, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly, and apply to the rest of the flesh burning and corrosive medicines to remove everything; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it and draw it out, for as long as the corrupted bone remains, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger corrupt, cut it at the joint as previously mentioned, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is wounded and swollen, and it causes great pain, you must first heal it;
then cut the nail of the whitlow with a sharp instrument by cutting across the top, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it does happen, apply something that soothes.
The extra fingers that grow on the hands of some men by chance are all fleshy, and by chance there are some in which there are bones, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or their origin is in some of the knuckles of the fingers.
That which grows on any knuckle of the finger does not move, and that which grows at the joint of the finger, by chance, moves;
the treatment of that which is fleshy is light, in this manner: cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
That which grows at the root of the joint is difficult to cure: therefore be wary of cutting.
In that which grows on the finger at the last joint, it is necessary that you first cut the flesh roundly to the bone, then cut the bone with a saw suitable for this, then cure it until it is healed.
The joining together that occurs in the fingers comes from birth, or from the joining of a wound, or from a burn by fire, or from similar things.
Then it is necessary that you cut that joining, so that the fingers return to their natural forms; then place between them tents or cloths moistened in rose oil, that they not join together; or you place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as is necessary.
If a joining occurs to any of the fingers with the palm, then cut that joining as is necessary.
Varicose veins are large swollen veins full of melancholic superfluities, which appear in many parts of the body;
and it happens more in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
It is necessary, then, that you sometimes administer a purging of bile, and then bleed from the basilic vein.
The treatment with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out; and the other method is that you open the vein, and draw it all out.
The incision is according to this method: first bathe the leg in very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one place, or in two or in three, with a wide cut, then raise and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear;
and then bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile;
and resume the evacuation and the healing when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The raising of him is according to this manner: raise the leg of the patient, if there is much hair, then put it in the bath, and pour warm water over the leg until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, then heat it by the fire, and then cut it towards the vein lengthwise from the head of the knee, or in the lower part at the ankle;
then open the skin with the lancet, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when one feels it;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it seems like a white cord;
then put the instrument underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then pierce it lightly with the lancet, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then raise it with the instrument, as you have done, and pierce it with another lancet, as you have done before;
then make another cut, or several if you need them, then raise it, and cut it at the toe, then pull and raise it to the second cut;
then pull it out cut by cut, until it is all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull it out and raise it, then put a needle with a strong double thread into it, and tie it and pull it, and put an instrument underneath, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it comes out; and be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, then one cannot pull it out or raise it, and it causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, put on the wound wool moistened in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the intestine is constricted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must forcefully split it, but not cut it; and pull it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the intestine is curved, and it does not cut, lest it cut the vein;
and is of a large curve, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the form:
This vein is generated in legs, in hot places where no herbs or trees grow, and in earth where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the corruption that comes from under the skin, just as serpents and worms are generated within the body, between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very great inflammation comes in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead of one and a half to two fingers' breadth, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging from the leg, and every time that a point comes out, wrap it around the lead and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root, until it is entirely emerged; for if you cut it, it returns into the flesh, and causes an abscess and corruption in the place, and a serious illness;
because of which it is necessary that it be drawn out little by little to the end, and that nothing of it remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when it is drawn out, is five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a probe into the hole, and probe it to the bottom, so that all of it comes out;
and let the matter which is inside be emptied, and apply to the place medicines preventing corruption for some days, then cure it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many roots, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many holes come from it, and from which roots emerge;
cure it then as we have said before.
of the worms which are born between skin and flesh This illness is called in our land "ox disease", because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm which is born between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body rising and descending, and one feels it well in going from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and bursts forth;
and is engendered by the corruption of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and earthworms and ascarids come in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it goes through the body, and it rises to the head, and it comes to the eye, perchance it enters, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you see it to cure and draw, then one can only draw it out when it moves:
then it is necessary that you bind the place above and below with a strong bandage tightly, then cut above and draw it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you do not find it, then cauterize it with fire, until it dies;
and the greatest harm that it does, is that it corrodes the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, then press down firmly on the eyebrow below it, then cut above, and draw it out;
and it is necessary to treat the patient with bodily cleansing and purgative medicines for the putrid humors, and to abstain from foods causing putrefaction.
Of the pain that comes from flatulence This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in certain limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and a little later, I saw it climb like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from one place to another;
the pain departed from that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran through the whole body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it constantly circled around her body, as I saw it.
I greatly wondered how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this manner. However, I had seen many who had felt pain move from one place to another, but I had not seen it as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought that it was because the woman had a dry body, and the veins uncovered, and therefore that constrained windiness appeared;
and it does not appear for the same reason in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears as we have said, bind it above and below quickly, and then cut above until that constrained windiness escapes from the place; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, treat it with things that expel windiness, such as fetid pills, and pills of serapinum, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they lodge.
Their diversity is that there are some with large points, and small, and barbed, and blunt; and some that have two angles, and some that have tongues, and some that are broken;
and that which lodges in a limb lodges in two ways: or in a principal member, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it then lodges in any of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you later, appear: then you must beware of extracting this arrow, for death follows in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not very deep, then I draw it, and treat the wound.
And the signs in the brain when the arrow lodges there and pierces the bone, and the dura mater which is above the brain is injured, are:  scotoma and sweating and dizziness and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood flows from the nostrils, or from the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and there comes from the wound a white moisture resembling pus, and also something like a shred of flesh;
and if these signs appear, abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not embedded.
The signs that the arrow is in the heart are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were stuck in something hard, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like pus, and dark blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat, and syncope come; know then without doubt that death approaches.
And the signs that the arrow has injured the lung are that frothy sputum comes from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs deeply and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow falls into the covering of the breast, it is near the small ribs; and produces great shortness of breath and great pain and sighing; and all the limbs from the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, perhaps something of the undigested food comes from the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the belly, and a point of dung comes out through the intestine, there is no hope of cure, nor of extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out and flows, and the patient feels severe pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other members, such as the face and the neck and the throat and the shoulder and the arm and the spine of the back and the breastbone and the thigh and the legs, and similar members, are safe according to various dispositions. When the arrow is in the nerve or the artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow fell into his tear duct at the root of the nose: I probed it, and drew it out from below the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I drew out an arrow for a man which had fallen into the fat of the eye below the eyelid, and the arrow was embedded, and I could only reach the point towards the shaft, and the arrow was as large as a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs;
the man was healed, and no ill effects came to him.
And I drew an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was an Arabic one with barbs:
I cut the barbs, and worked so subtly that I drew it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I drew an arrow for a man, which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, his condition did not change; I cut upon the arrow, and I grasped it, and drew it forth, and there was no bad accident.
And I saw a man into whom an arrow fell in the back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural dispositions, nor did he find harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whom an arrow fell in his face, and the wound was closed; and it remained so without suffering great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen into his nose, and was slightly leaning towards the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had fallen in three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I searched it entirely with a slender probe, and did not feel it; and he felt pricking and pain beneath his right ear.
I thought that it was from the point of the arrow. I applied to the place an attractive and digestive plaster, so that the place would not swell; and the location of the arrow appeared to me.
and the location of the arrow appeared to me. I put the plaster there many days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained thus a long time, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose;
and he told me so. I put a corrosive watery medicine on the wound for many days, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow which was sticking in the place;
then I added to the opening of the wound with that watery medicine, until the head of the arrow appeared visibly to me;
and the time passed well for about four months, and then I widened the wound so that I inserted the forceps, and moved them from one side to the other, and it could not come out;
then I did not cease to refine and devise methods of instruments, until I grasped it one day with well-made forceps, according to what its form will become at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it, and healed the wound.
And the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely cured.
Now I have told you the quality of the extraction of some arrows, so that you apply your care to what I do not say, for the book cannot encompass everything;
but the wise master considers even a small thing well, and from what is present and lacking, finds new work, and a new instrument, in dealing with the strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not come out of the limbs where they are fixed except according to two ways: either through the place where they entered, or through another part;
and that which leaps out through the place where it entered, that is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes leaping out immediately.
And if it does not leap out immediately, leave it until the flesh is rotten around it, and the exit is eased;
and also if it is fixed in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it thus for some days, and move it each day;
and then it will leap out, and if it does not leap out, pierce around it with a thin drill, until the place around is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is hidden in the body so that one cannot see it, then search for it with a tent. and if you feel it, then pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot [do so] because of the narrowness of the wound, and because of the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then enlarge the wound so that it is large;
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs by which it holds, then remove the flesh which is stuck in from two sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can pull it out;
and be careful that you do not break the arrow, for you would pull it out more difficultly.
And if you cannot [do so] at once, then leave it until the surrounding flesh is rotted, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood hinders you, then use what we have said about its treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can best pull out the arrow without danger, whether quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently;
and position the patient according to the way he was when the arrow entered him, for that is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then position him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes from another direction, where something of it is visible, or the skin is swollen where one can see or feel it clearly:
then cut above it, until the forceps can grip it, and then pull it out: if it jumps out immediately.
And if it is lodged in the bone, rotate your hand round and round until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it for a while, and then resume the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, remove it with the whole shaft;
and if the shaft breaks, and you wish to administer a pull, use a suitable instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the head of the instrument;
and then pull it out, and if the arrow is broken, use an instrument with a point entering inwards, to facilitate the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must cut away all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as necessary.
And if the arrow lodges in the foot or in the belly or in the bladder or in the side, and it is near the surface, and you can cut over it, cut it;
and be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which arrows are extracted is similar to a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the pushing head is like a bird's feather, to push at the point of the arrow, as here is the shape:
There are 31 veins from which one is bled, of which there are 16 in the head, that is to say: Two behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein which is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two jugular veins which are in the neck; and the two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth, and these are the veins which are called "augeherich"; and two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the lay people call it "the vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "fast", and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it "the vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the lay people call it "the vein of the belly", and it is on the fossa, and it is that from which one bleeds, which appears manifestly on the wrist.
And the salvatory is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and in the foot there are three veins: one is under the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second saphenous which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein which is called "nase", which is in the ankle on the other side;
and in the other leg there are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with old catarrhs and migraines;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the head of the patient, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient tightens his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging down from the head: then prick them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed from there;
then take the lancet, and put it under the vein down to the bone, then lift your hand with the vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well two fingers breadth across, and let the blood flow as much as you wish;
then constrain and bind it, until it is healed;
and I have already spoken of incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for chronic migraine, and toothache, and habitual ophthalmia, and for the flow of watery tears from the eyes;
and the quality of the bleeding is as I said: and it is that the patient should constrict his neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed from there;
then lift the skin above the vein up to your index finger, and put the lancet underneath, and lift the vein up, and cut it, as you have done in the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your needs;
then untie the patient, and put your finger on the vein for an hour, then put on cotton; and then bind it firmly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for old facial diseases, and for migraine, and for redness;
and the method is that the patient twists his neck, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called a "fossor", of which this is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press down with your hand, or something else, and let the blood flow according to the quantity that you wish; then untie the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed, and sometimes the work is done with a wide blade.
However, it is not necessary that the blade be too sharp; and cut across, for the bone is near, and perhaps the blade will break when it is thin.
Bleeding from the two veins that are in the two temples helps the eyes, and ringworm, and redness, and hordeolum in the eye, and the diseases of the face;
and the quality of their bleeding is that the patient constricts his neck by twisting it with some linen, as before;
then bleed, and let the bleeding be across, a little of the length of the blade a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the blade is thin, perhaps it will break;
then make the blood flow, as much as you need, and then bind on cotton, and bind it well.
Bleeding from the vein of the nose is good for fever, and for raging thirst, and for facial illnesses, such as migraine and redness that comes in the face, and especially when it is chronic;
and the manner of bleeding is that the patient constricts his neck, then holds his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin blade, and insert it into the lip in the space that is between the two nostrils, because the vein does not appear very well there, and the blood will begin to flow immediately;
and do not go too deep, and make the blood flow according to your need, then bind it for one night, because it is very quickly restored;
Bleeding from the two temples helps with shortness of breath, and the beginning of leprosy, and many illnesses, and impetigo, and toothache, and herpes, and fistulas;
and the manner of bleeding is that the patient constricts his neck on both sides, as we have said;
and let the master stand over the patient's head, and let the patient sit on a seat, then open the vein along a little widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is needed;
then do likewise in the other vein, then untie the ligature, and bind both veins moderately, so that the patient does not strangle; and leave it until morning, that the wound may be healed.
Of bleeding the lips Bleeding the veins of the upper lips helps with bile in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and around.
And the method of bleeding is to have the patient sit before you, and constrict his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is at the right lip and the other at the left, and they are known by this that they are black, and by this that around them are small black veins:
then cut one and the other, and if you do not know them, and you are in doubt, then cut the larger one on each side, and do the same with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
Of bleeding under the tongue Bleeding from the veins that are under the tongue helps after bleeding from the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient sits between your hands before the sun, and lifts his tongue, and looks underneath on each side for a black vein:
bleed then one and the other, and do not go too deep, for underneath are the arteries.
The veins of the neck from which one commonly bleeds are bled according to two methods:
either by piercing with a flat, broad lancet, or an olive-shaped, slender one, like a cutting knife, and it is called "anesil"; and are broad and slender according to the breadth and narrowness of the veins. The form of the broad lancet is very renowned, and is broad as you see:
And it is necessary for opening hairy veins full of thick, apparent blood, and which contain thick and cloudy blood; and this is the form of the olive-shaped lancet:
and is more slenderly pointed, and is for bleeding the slender veins, where there is thin, citrine blood.
Bleeding from the basilica vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the abdomen;
and it is necessary for the bleeder that he bleeds wisely, and that he avoids the artery which is underneath. And if he cuts the artery, and a great flow of blood comes, then it is necessary to stanch it, as I have said; and the lancet should not be pointed, but cutting like a chisel.
And if the basilica vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary that you seek it out, and choose another; or you seek a branch of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut with the lancet-chisel, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of the bleeding, it is necessary that you extend the arm, that you touch the place until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then bind the arm, and cut the vein with the lancet-chisel; and beware that you do not injure the artery when you see the place swollen, for that is the artery: wipe it then.
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery: hurry then, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; if not, bind the arm, and leave it so, and let the patient not move it;
and let him be careful, and not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and medicine is not present, then cut the artery if it is visible, for the head of it retracts; and stop the blood.
And take a piece of bark from a fig tree, and split it, and take one of the halves and bind it on well until the next day;
if the blood stops, it is good; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and the staunching is not difficult in many cases because of the small size of the wound, and the power of the ligament of the arm.
The bleeding from the vein in the middle helps because it draws blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the surgeon to be careful for the nerve which is below, and if he probes too deeply, and he finds the nerve, and it swells and the bleeding is difficult, and perhaps cannot heal;
and this nerve is often visible, and if it is not visible in some men because of its subtlety, then you must bleed it with a lancet; and avoid the nerve to your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, because it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking at the olivary vein or the myrtle vein, for this is the safest of all the veins, for beneath it there is neither nerve nor artery. However, one should seek the easiest place, and it matters not if one fails the first time, and one begins again; and perhaps the place swells in some men, when one fails the first time, but it matters not.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your judgment.
The first thing you must know about bleeding is that bleeding is not administered except to preserve health, and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bleeding be done in one of the three veins that are in the arm: that is to say, cephalic, median, and basilic; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring fasting, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear;
and one should bleed on the first day or the third, after two or three hours of the day.
Bleeding which is administered for illnesses has no determined hour, but when there is need, by day or by night, at all hours and at all times;
and one should not bleed children until fourteen years, nor a woman carrying a child except from the fourth month until the seventh. Nor should the old who have passed sixty years be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary that he cleanse the intestines with a light clyster, if he has much retained fecal matter, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members;
nor should one bleed him who is too full of food, nor who is drunk, until he is sober, nor those with dropsy;
and one should beware of bleeding after colic, vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse with women, and labor, and wakefulness and fasting, and anything that weakens, either through something of the mind or of the body;
then thin the humors, if the blood is thick, by foods and drinks and medicines, if you have the power to do so;
then enter the bath, if nothing forbids it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the vein of the arm near the third [joint], as we have said;
and on that day guard yourself from work, and pain, and lust, and similar things;
and be cheerful and happy, and let the bleeder be higher than the one who is bled, and let him rub the arm two or three times, then tie the ligature above moderately, for when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the place with the hands, until the veins swell, and one feels them;
then the bleeder moistens the lancet with a little old oil, then places the finger of his left hand on that vein below the place a little where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and fail when it is struck.
For there are veins that flee like strings when being bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when one puts the lancet on, it withdraws from the lancet, and the vein cannot be opened, and so it is with those; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bleeder must be skilled in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, it is good; if not, he begins again a little below or above that place quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave it for one or two days, and do not bind the arm: by chance an abscess will form there;
nor enter the bath, then resume the bleeding if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you doubt that enough blood will come out as you wish, strike into that same opening with the whole blade straight;
and work somewhat quickly, before the place is swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not resume the bleeding, and put on a little oil of lye, for it lightens the body of blood, and lye is softer in this place than oil;
and thus administer the oil of lye in each bleeding when you bleed the veins, to staunch the flow of blood;
and the same does theriac and ox-gall, when one puts it on the place; so it thins the blood and separates it when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess develops there, which happens many times, especially when it is not bled except at the time when the opening of the vein is small, hasten, and put on the place a sponge moistened in water and a little hot salt, and hold it for an hour;
and you must do this after the flow of blood from the vein, and if there remains in the place after some days some blackness or greenness, it does not harm; and if you wish, put on something of aloes or myrrh dissolved in juice of calamint, or mint, or similar.
And many times an abscess and swelling appear at the bleeding of the basilica vein:
then put your hand on, and if you find the place soft at the compression of the hand, then that swelling is bad. Avoid then that you put on nothing of what we have said, for perhaps it would cut off the artery;
but make for it a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with another treatment, until it is healed.
And draw blood from each one according to the quantity of his strength, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, that a larger wound be made for him, and the lancet be wide;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and he should be bled little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bleeding is safer from the flow of blood and the cutting of nerves, and is better than bleeding lengthwise or across.
And to one whose body fails during bloodletting, one should give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is feverish, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of a cold complexion, let him eat before bloodletting bread soaked in spiced syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during bloodletting, after the release of much blood, he should drink broth of meat, and subtle scented syrup, and use the other things that we have said in the section or chapter on syncope, for the opening of a vein.
And if he wishes to bleed his arm, and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his strength continuously.
And whoever wishes to bleed his arm after the first bleeding, and he has a strong body, let him bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wishes to bleed from another part, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body which is already heated, and causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a great quantity, and widen the opening until it falls into a faint; then you should observe all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand on his pulse while he bleeds, lest death come instead of fainting, and this happens many times, when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not necessary when you wish to untie the arm, and cause blood to flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor if it is bent, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but leave it until it bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of a flame, until the blood which is congealed in the opening of the vein flows out freely, and put on it a little salt mixed with water, and press lightly upon it.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not bind it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if there is need to draw blood a second time, bleed him in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the arm is bled in place of the vein in the head because it is well-composed.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the vein is red;
then it should be bound moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it immediately across, not across the width or length;
and let the opening be wide, and bleed very near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for it is put in more in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is neither artery nor nerve there.
Bleeding from the vein of the right hand's salvation is good for all liver diseases, and this is the method:
constrict the hand, and put it in warm water until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if it bleeds across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, completely bare of flesh, and then return the hand to warm water, if the blood is congealed in the wound and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as is needed, put oil and salt on the vein to quickly cauterize, and do so for each vein.
Bleeding from the left hand is good for the disease of the head, and do just as I have told you for the right.
Bleeding from the saphena vein is good for all the illnesses that are below the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and the retention of menses, and illness of the kidneys, and of the thighs and old legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs the vein until it swells, and binds above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and many veins go above the foot;
bleed then from the largest vein, or at the ankle, which is more effective.
And if you bleed it above the foot, beware of the nerves that are below, and bleed across as if cutting;
and let the blade be sharp.
And if the blood cannot come out, put the foot in water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, start again a little higher up the second time, for the place is salty;
do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the ankle, and its bleeding is good for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is such that the patient enters the bath, and squeezes above the ankle with four fingers twisting, because otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, bleed it in every way that you can, and across; and it is better that you cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very plentiful in many men.
and it is better that you cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very plentiful in many men. And if you do not find it, bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and make as much blood flow as you wish, and then untie the ligature, and apply cotton and bind it; it is now healed.
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass;
and venesection is done in two ways: either by cutting and drawing blood, or without cutting.
And this venesection which is without cutting is done in two ways: either it is with fire, or without fire;
and venesection which is done by cutting and by extraction of blood is done in fourteen places of the body, of which one is at the very top of the head; and the other is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping glass below the chin; and the cupping glasses on the two shoulders; and the cupping glasses on the buttocks; and the cupping glasses in the middle of the two arms; and the cupping glasses on the two legs; and the cupping glasses on the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw blood except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not weaken one, as is done with bloodletting from a vein; and it is not necessary that it be administered, either with fire or without fire, in any illness that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if, by necessity of illness or custom, it is necessary to cup, then let it be administered every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between, and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are some who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is mid-month, we order them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting of the temple helps the headache... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bloodletting of the cephalic vein, and it is not necessary that one who is of cold complexion use it, or who has a catarrh, for it does them much harm;
and therefore it is not necessary that the elderly use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And he who is often bled, becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping a little lower because of the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bloodletting of the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for tightness of the chest, and for the splitting of the windpipe, and for cough, and for repletion;
and it should be applied lightly, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness in the stomach and the heart.
Cupping at the two ribs of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia, and migraine, and for strangulation, and for pain at the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bloodletting of the basilic vein;
and you must instruct the phlebotomist to extend the arm when he makes the incision, so that he does not cut the artery, and a great flow of blood does not result.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth diseases, and for corruption of the gums, and similar diseases which are in the mouth; and is in place of bloodletting of the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is good for illness that comes from heat and fullness.
Cupping of the elbows is as good as three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from those large veins;
and instruct the phlebotomist not to go too deep, for the place is bare of flesh, and has nerves and arteries underneath.
The cupping glass which is on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament, and for the illnesses below, and it is necessary that the cupping glass be large, and be of brass, that it needs to draw well; and by chance, if it were thin, it would break; and it makes large wounds.
The cupping glasses of the legs are manifestly healing, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the loins, and of the marrow, and of the bladder, and they restore the complexion;
and are placed on the two shins, and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause faintness in many dispositions.
The manner of applying the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and place it quickly, and move evenly, and do not cease doing this, until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears;
then heat, and replace the cupping glasses, and take care in the disposition of bodies, for there are some who have tender flesh, and clear pores: it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and somewhat deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to refine the path of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we wish to draw blood little by little, one time is sufficient. And if we want a lot of blood, we begin again often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is that the heart be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with aperitive and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the excess is thick and cold, take marjoram oil, or balm oil, or dill oil, and the like.
And if the one whom you treat has tender flesh and large pores, then it is not necessary to apply any oil, but it should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And the one who has much moisture, should rise with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick excesses rise with old wine, or beet juice, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not bleed with cupping before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath one or two hours;
and do not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary that he be warned, when he is to be cupped and when he has been cupped.
And beware if the one who is bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things; and eat young chickens, and capon flesh, and moist meats.
and eat young chickens, and capon flesh, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion, should take honey syrup, and moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat young chickens and small birds and pigeons;
and on the day that he is bled, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before or after bloodletting, to strengthen the principal members; and let the blood be thinned, but it is not necessary that those who are hot drink it.
The cupping glasses that are applied without incision are those that are applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the groin and the kidneys and the hip, for those members do not tolerate being incised, and it is done only to draw blood from member to member, just as we apply them to the breasts when the milk flows;
to remove the viscosity that is in the member, just as we apply cupping glasses to the belly and to the groin to soften the member;
and removes the pain, when there is an obstruction or stone, it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and so it does when it is applied to the liver and to the spleen when there is retained flatulence, and these cupping glasses are administered empty to only suck; and sometimes they are administered with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a way that one fills the cupping glass with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping glass administered with fire is this:
And let it be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and let it have on the side around the middle a small hole, as if to insert a needle, and let it be of bronze, smooth in front so that it does not injure the patient when placed on the limb;
and let it have in the middle a crossbar of bronze or iron, to place a burning candle in, and let there be both large and small ones according to the diseases and the age of those who receive them;
for the cupping glasses of children are different from those of old people, and of thin people from those of fat people.
And one should thus place this cupping glass on the limb:
take a candle of wax or a liniment, and put it in the cupping glass across the crossbar which is in the cupping glass, so that the flame is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then put it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the hole that we have mentioned, so that when one wants, the vapor goes out, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the liniment as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass then, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with sharp pain, there is no crossbar or hole, and it is not administered except when it is full of water, and it is placed on the limb only;
and this is the method:
Leech applications are administered only in limbs where cupping glasses cannot be applied because of their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and others similar;
and the quality of the leech is that when you find leeches which are in clear fresh water without decay, you should take them;
and put them for one night in fresh water, until they are hungry and have nothing in their bellies; and then having bled the patient with a vein incision and cupping, then rub the limb until it is red, and apply the leeches;
and when they are full and fall off, if it is a place where one can apply a cupping glass, apply it, for this is very beneficial afterwards.
If not, raise the area with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then wipe it.
And if the place bleeds too much after the removal of the leeches, soak a linen cloth in cold water, and apply it until the bleeding stops;
and if the bleeding is profuse, apply crushed vitriol, or galls, and similar things, until it stops;
or you may put on the place halves of peeled beans, and leave them until they become warm on the place, this will stop it immediately;
and if you need more, take other leeches.
And if the leeches will not attach, rub the place with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until blood flows, and then apply them, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
and when you see that they fall off, sprinkle a little aloes and salt, crushed, or ashes, upon them, and they will immediately fall off.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish people avoid this chapter, because they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read any letters of them;
and for this reason the science is estranged in our land, for I never found any good one;
and I know nothing, except through the science of the ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have drawn the science from them, and by experiment, and by the custom of my life;
and I have described to you in this chapter what is contained therein, and have abridged it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is necessary then that we say in the prologue of this book the sums of the speech and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or sprain or bruise comes to someone, it is necessary that you hasten to bleed the patient on one side and the other, if nothing prevents you, such as weakness of body, or infants, or old men; or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold foods, that is to say cold meats, and the flesh of birds and of kids, and let him not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and let him not fill himself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you have no doubt of a hot abscess, or of the spread of matter in the limb;
then let the patient return to his former regimen that he had used.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that one nourish the patient with foods that provide strong nourishment, or that have viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and tripe of cow, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the flesh mends and the fracture heals more quickly.
And know that the broken bones of the old and the decrepit cannot be well mended or healed according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of small children;
but there is a cure, reset the broken bone with thick bandages that support and join the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not remove it from its work, and for this reason it is necessary to nourish him with strong foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the breast, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes across, and another lengthwise, like the cutting of a quill for writing.
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another lengthwise, like the cutting of a quill for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small fissure.
And each type has its own device and its own instrument for restoration, according to what comes to mind in its place;
and a fracture of the bone is known because the place is twisted, and it appears clearly by swelling, and it sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture;
but there may well be a twisting, or a fissure, or a small fracture. Then you must not move it by hand, but apply the medicines that follow, and then carefully straighten it immediately.
And know that for a fracture that is spiral, and the two parts are disjointed, they must immediately be set evenly, before abscesses form there;
and if hot abscesses form, leave it for a few days, until the abscesses are calmed;
then set it evenly so that you can easily and wisely move it, and know that the restoration of this is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces;
then straighten it, as is necessary hereafter.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, then extend it from two sides, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and place the limb according to its natural form, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, bring back by all means the additions to their places as much as you can, and ensure that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain;
and join well the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well:
then straighten it nicely, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do who cause by their work a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have seen many times.
And when the limb is in place, instruct the patient well that he not move it, neither waking nor sleeping, nor turning, nor in any other manner; and ensure well that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and ensure well that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and take care that it is placed straight, that no crookedness comes when it is restored;
and the qualities of the broken limb are as I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in greatness and in form.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar: then it is necessary to wrap it with soft and fine linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thigh and leg:
then it is necessary to wrap it with a wide and strong cloth, for the wide cloths embrace the whole large limb, and bind it equally on all sides, so that there is no space;
then bind around light tow, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little around the whole cloth, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture may then move the fracture a little;
and soften the cloth little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy place, then take another cloth, and turn it again over the broken place;
then return to the part below the fracture, and bind it moderately, neither too tightly nor too loosely, as we have said in the first book above;
then place between the cloths linen tow or cloths, until it is all even, then bind all above with a bandage, and then apply your well-made splints, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then apply something that soothes a hot abscess, and which removes the swelling, and leave it so for a few days;
then bind on your splints, and let them be half of a wide, wisely cut cane, or of wood from which one makes wedges, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint that one places on the fracture be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and let it also be as long as is necessary for the limb, small or large; then bind on the splints as you did in the first binding, then bind over it a suitable thread, as in the first binding over the fracture; tighter above, always less so;
and it is necessary that the threads be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bandages from twisted linen cords, and this is a great error, for the bandage cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not necessary that there be less than the width of a finger between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after the binding in healthy places, place under them linen, or carded wool, so that he is not wounded.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment afterwards.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all the broken limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to apply splints except after five days or seven, or more according to your certainty of a hot abscess arising;
And here is the manner of ancient plasters to restore fracture, dislocation, and torsion:
and it is that you take the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill, and you mix it with plenty of egg, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common way of the plaster restoring the fracture in many situations, and especially for women and small children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another manner of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and torsion: Take 3 drams of labdanum and enula and asafoetida and gum arabic and myrrh, each 10 drams; myrrh and aloes, each 5 drams; elecampane 9 drams; and make them into a powder, and mix them with egg white; If the man's complexion is hot, use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is beneficial to many men.
Another kind of plaster that is good for sprains: take comfrey and mallow, each 10 drams; myrrh and aloes, each 9 drams; gum arabic 6 drams; Armenian bole 10 drams, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply it.
Another type of plaster for joints and bones dislocated from their place, and it soothes the resulting pain, and the splintering and breaking of the bone: Take new wool, and soak it in vinegar and boiled oil, and apply it to the place.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and it properly removes the pain.
Another type of plaster which restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of henbane, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another type of plaster for the restoration of a broken bone and for reducing the remainder of an abscess. Take mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, vetch flour, one part of each;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water, or with water, and use it.
Another type of plaster stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take mallow roots, and flaxseed, balausta, melilot, and  comfrey, and violet and chamomile flowers, of all equally one part; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its condition.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on a broken limb for restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on the broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and mix them equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and bind it.
And then unbind it a little afterwards, and take care if the patient feels no pain, or if the bone has not moved from its place; if not, unbind it in several days. And if pain or itching comes to the place, without rest or swelling, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately;
and take a light cloth, and a wet sea sponge, and dip it in water, and lift up the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is appeased; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind on a nut, until you are sure of a hot abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb will subside, and the pain will be removed, then recommence the subtle binding, and a little of the plaster, and do not bind it so tightly as before; and continue until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess and redness and pain and swelling are completely removed, and you need a plaster and a bandage, then recommence it, as you did at first equally.
And if nothing comes of what we have said to the limb, then do not unbind it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes leave it twenty days, according to what one sees, until the fracture mends, and the joining of the flesh approaches;
then restrain it more than before, and it thickens its flesh, as I have said before;
and if you see the place drying out more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come to it; therefore bathe it with warm water, every time you unbind it, and let this be every third day, and loosen the bandage a little;
by this work then nourishment comes quickly to the limb, and it quickly amends what foolish physicians do, who restore the limb badly:
that is bad, and it is dangerous work, and I see nothing else but to leave it and to work correctly.
Many kinds of fractures there are, and various forms, and the causes are different;
for there are fractures that are made by the blow of a sword, and the neck breaks all the bone down to the periosteum which is under the bone, as an axe or club does; and for this reason this kind of fracture is called "hachure".
Or the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing, and this kind of fracture is called "absolute";
and the wound of these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a blow with a blunt object, or a fissure from a stone's edge, or from falling on a stone, or from other similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which reaches down to the membrane which is under the bone, or which is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound which is a crack in the bone as fine as a hair, and the fissure is small, and for this reason this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound which is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and drives a piece of the bone inward, and the place is swollen as do cauldrons when they are struck on the boilers; if the stone enters inside.
And this happens more to those who have soft bones in the head, such as the head of a child;
and it happens in all these manners of fracture that small pieces are separated like stars; and I will speak in its place.
And we recognize all manners of fractures by the pulling on them, and the probing with probes, and by the corrupted flesh which is on top.
The hair-like appearance is known by this, that when one has uncovered the bone, and one rubs a cloth on it, the black fracture appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, take heed of the accidents of the patient, and if you see any bad accident, such as vomiting of bile, and loss of consciousness, and convulsions, and swooning, and acute fever, and the eyes protruding and reddening, and other similar things in various dispositions, then it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you see no frightening accident, and you hope for salvation, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded man first comes to you, and it is in winter, it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day at most that you can.
And if it is in summer, then hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the flesh under the bone is corrupted, and the accidents that we have mentioned come.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane that covers the brain, then it is necessary that you split the split part thus:
and it is that you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way that you can, and over the surface of the wound as smoothly as you can, and if bleeding occurs upon uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, help him with what is necessary, and it is that you fill the place with cloths moistened in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and you are assured of the cessation of bleeding; then begin around the bone to remove it, and this is done according to two methods of work:
one method is that you cut with a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then make another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and they are of tempered iron;
and work lightly, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must pierce it around, before you administer incisions with chisels, not so deeply that it pierces through the skull bone, and it should have a margin or circle above the point, which prevents the point from passing beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each comes into its place on the thickness of the bone, so that you have chisels for the whole head;
and this is the form of the three types of chisels:
The method for piercing around the fractured bone is that you place a chisel on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then put the chisel elsewhere a little afterwards, and thus do it all around, then cut with the incisors the thickness of the bone which is between the holes, and do this as subtly as you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you draw out the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments that you have such as forceps, pincers;
and be careful that you do not touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and drawn out the bone, it is necessary that you remove the remaining fragment of bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other incisors;
and if any small bones or scales remain, remove them lightly with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with tents and ointments as we have said.
And the other method of operation is that which Galen described, which is safer; and he praises it very highly, and that is his word. First, you must uncover a part of the bone where the broken part appears moved, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will place under the head of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the form:
And it does not cut on one side, and the part is sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet above, so that you cut the bone lightly all around, and take good care of the membrane which is underneath;
if it is attached to the bone, remove it lightly, for one removes it well without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not reach the membrane, and the bone is only cut on top, and there are small pieces, then one must remove that roughness, and remove the splinters with a fine rasp of which you should have various sizes, to apply in each place the most suitable, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
So begin with large rasps, and then with finer ones, and do not cease doing this until it is well.
In each of the other hairline fractures and subtle breaks, you must apply a remedy according to its condition;
and this is something that is not unknown to one who has applied himself to this art.
And if the fascia is uncovered, you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth doubled over two or three times, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so that you do not injure the fascia, then apply another bandage on top, and do not bind it tightly except to hold the wound in place;
and leave it thus for one or two days, until the swelling of the abscess is reduced, then unbind it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and bean flour, and incense powder, and birthwort, and similar things;
and of these things make a powder, and put it on the wound, and constantly apply cleansing medicines without biting.
and ensure that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave ointment on it, nor allow pus to accumulate, for when pus gathers on the brain membrane, it corrupts and rots it, and great harm comes to the patient;
for when something biting is applied to the fascia, it shrivels up above. Take heed then, if any bad accident befalls the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly doubtful.
And if blackness comes only because of the medicine that has been applied, that has such a property, then you must take one part honey, and three parts rose oil, and glue one cloth to it, and put it on the fascia; then treat it with the necessary treatments, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two parts of the nose are broken above, or one part by itself, for they are two bones;
and that below is cartilaginous, and does not break, unless it is bent or twisted, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, then you must put your little finger in the hole of the nose, and set the fracture even with your index finger inside and your thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and take care that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, then you must set it even with the head of a slightly thick rod.
And if the fracture is in two parts, do likewise, and hasten to restore it the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the swelling of the abscess has subsided, then put into the head of the nose tents of linen cloths, if the fracture is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side, if the fracture is there; and let the tents be so large that they fill the openings of the nose.
And some restorers say that one should moisten the tents in butter, and change them each day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they must be moistened in a confection of egg white and mill dust; then leave the tent until the bone is strong, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes one puts goose feathers in the nose instead of tents, and a soft cloth around it, and it holds the fracture, and the patient blows through it; or do what you wish.
And if hot abscesses come to the nose while you are working there, put cerate or cotton moistened in rose oil, or in a little diachylon.
And if hot abscesses do not come there, put a plaster outside, of barley flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then put on light lint, and do not bind the nose;
and if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract it with instruments suitable for this, then sew the fissure, and treat it with things that generate flesh and heal, such as plasters and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead rings there, until it is healed.
When the mandible is broken underneath, and there is no wound outside, and the fracture is only outside, and it is not broken in two, except for splinters inside, one recognizes it easily.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left mandible, put your index finger of the right hand, and gently put the fracture inside, and adjust it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the fracture of the mandible is separated in two, it is necessary that you administer extension from two parts, until they are equal.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or breakage, restrain them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then place cerate on the broken mandible, and place a double cloth over it; and place on the cloth a well-made large star, or a piece of even leather, long and wide according to the mandible, and bind it as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, unbind it on the third day, and then readjust what has changed; and apply a plaster, of powdered millstone with egg white or bean flour, after you have removed the cerate;
and place light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster dries, and the condition of the patient does not change, leave it until it is healed; often it is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses appear, administer what we have often said.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, observe if any piece of the bone is removed; then carefully remove it with instruments suitable for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a blade according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew the wound, if it is large, and apply suitable plasters to it, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
The clavicle breaks many times in front, towards the shoulder, and the fracture is in three ways:
or it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure is, when the fracture is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken clavicle; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then set the fracture with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor shortening.
And if you need to extend further, then place under the patient's shoulder a round sphere of cloth, or of wool, and let it be large according to your need; and extend and lift the clavicle, and pull the sphere with your hand, so that you set the fracture evenly, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the clavicle outwards, because it is deeply impacted, then the patient must often lie on his back, and place a medium-sized pillow under the shoulder, and the assistant lowers the shoulder, until the bone of the clavicle is raised.
And then set the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken, then you must cut it open;
and pull the pieces gently apart, and if the bone cannot join because of some overlapping, then cut it with one of the knives that you have; but that you place this instrument under the clavicle, to protect the viscera:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not pointed, and should be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the demands of the operation;
and it has two ends, as you see, one wide, and the other narrow, like the opening of the wound that you have made when you pulled the bones apart;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, cut the wound, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with cloths and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses appear, soak a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The reduction of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you apply to the bone a plaster of ground powder and egg white, and place light tampons over it, and place a splint under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very wide bandage, a palm wide, then place a double cloth over the tampons and the plaster; then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage is hanging; and place the splint on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the affected armpit; and bind it from each side, and when you see that the binding holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the splint does not move on the broken bone, then examine it each day, and when the bandage loosens, then tighten it;
and make the patient lie on his back, and when he sleeps, place a small pillow under his armpit to raise the shoulder; this will lighten the fracture of the collarbone by the elevation of the shoulder, or you bind his arm to his neck, and do not unbind it unless a bad accident occurs, up to twenty days;
then renew the plaster, if you see that it is necessary, and bind it and leave it so, until it is healed;
and it is healed in at most twenty-eight days, and in less for some men.
Of the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks either in a wide place or in the middle, and one does not know it except by touch;
then set it according to the shape of the fracture, and reset it according to its natural form, in all the ways that you can;
then put on the place mill powder with egg white, and light lint, and put on a double cloth; then put on a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the splint there is hair in any place on the shoulder, then fill that hair with linen lint, so that the splint sits evenly;
and then bind it all with a strong bandage firmly, so that the splint does not move from its place, and examine the binding each day;
and every time that it loosens, then bind it, and set the splint evenly if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on their side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five.
And when this number is complete, then unbind it, and be sure, for it is not a bone that easily dislocates.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes, and points below the heart, then incise, and remove it, and do what we have said in the fracture of the clavicle to soothe a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the breast
The breast is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks on the outside.
And when it is broken in the middle, it inclines downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and immediately, and perhaps vomits blood, and the hair appears in the broken bone, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and a cushion is placed between his shoulders, then press the shoulders, and bring together the ribs of the two sides with your hands, and subtly put it equally in all ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put on plasters and lint over the subtle star of salt, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and tie it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the bandage round the back, and tighten it properly, and check every hour the bandage, and if it loosens, then tighten it;
and if it is necessary to untie it, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the place, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and untie it, and remove the plaster, and address what has come there in ways of treatment;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs only occurs in the large spaces behind the back, and in the front, and they only break because they are slippery; and one feels it well on examination with the fingers.
And the restoration is that you set the fracture equal, as is necessary. And then apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need to.
And if the rib fracture is inward leaning, the patient feels very great pain, and a stabbing pain, like pleurisy, because the bone pierces the lung; and breathes with difficulty, and quickly vomits a great deal of blood, and this is a serious condition, and the ancients have applied great skill to it.
And some say that one must administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, that hot abscesses do not come, if they have not already come. And if they have come, then heal them.
And some of them said that one places cupping glasses on the area, to strongly suck, and this seems reasonable; however, there is doubt that the cupping glass does not attract superfluities to the area due to the disposition of weakness.
And some of them said that one should cover the area with wool soaked in warm oil, and place tents between the ribs to evenly distribute the bandage around, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot bear because of the bone that pierces the flesh, and the patient is in doubt, then it is necessary to cut open the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place an instrument underneath to protect the viscera;
and then one must cut the bone, and pull gently, and then sew the two lips of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses appear, then apply cloths soaked in rose oil to the area;
and treat the area in the meantime as is necessary for an abscess, and let him lie often on the side where it should be, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, see if you see his hands softened and swollen and dead, and he cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, he does not feel it.
Know that he is mortal in many ways, and if he moves them and feels well when they are pulled and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is saved, and that the patient will be cured, if care is given.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, see if the feet are softened, and if the symptoms are there which are in the hands, and on the back there is flatulence and involuntary defecation;
and when he is turned on his belly, there is involuntary defecation. And when he is turned on his back and wants to sit up, he cannot. Know that he is mortal. So do not labor in his cure.
And if these symptoms do not occur, the matter is easier.
And the cure is that you observe if there is a hot abscess, then apply rose oil or egg yolk oil to it until it is calmed;
then apply one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on the part where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh, until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "cow's head", if you put your little finger of your left hand there, and set it even with the other hand as well as you can, then apply the plaster and the splint, if you need them;
then pull it out, and if there are separated bones, cut above them and remove them, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it does happen, it is only a slight diminution at the head; and it cracks lengthwise, and inclines inward, and the patient feels pain at the site, and pricking, and swelling where it is broken.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above, until you are above the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its form;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then set the fracture evenly, until it is of natural form.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it inclines inward, then make the patient lie on his stomach, until the setting of that fracture is prepared for you. And when you have set it evenly, then apply the plaster, then place a splint of wood or horn, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space under the ribs, until the binding is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on his healthy side, or on his back.
And if hot abscesses appear there, do not touch them until the hot abscesses are calmed, and apply what we have said before; and then return to the reduction, and bind it as is necessary, if there is no bad accident;
Of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder joint is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, then one must restore it according to one of two methods:
one of which is that you take a straight piece of wood of moderate thickness, according to this form:
And tie two straps to the two ends, and hang them upwards, and the patient sits on a seat;
then throw his broken arm onto the wood, until it reaches the armpit, and there is a curve of wood in the middle, then hang some heavy thing or the attendant stretches it downwards;
then let the doctor put the fracture even with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other method is that one supports the patient on his bed, and ties his hand to his neck, then instructs two attendants that one holds that which is above the fracture with his hands, and the other holds below with a strap, and each stretches at his part.
And if you want the traction to be stronger, then pull one strap below the fracture, and above the fracture, and each of the attendants stretches on his part.
And if the fracture is close to the head of the shoulder, then you must put one strap in the middle under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, below the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, then you must put a strap lightly, without effort, until the fracture is even above the place, and above the elbow;
then set the fracture evenly, as is necessary, and pull it, if no hot abscesses come.
And if hot abscesses come, then do not pull it until seven days, and apply wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot abscesses are calmed;
then pull it, and the manner of pulling is that you put the plaster on the fracture, then assemble the arm to the shoulder, and put your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and put the cloth, and pull on the shoulder and on the arm, so that the arm is in its proper place, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not moved.
And if you doubt that the bone will move, then use splints, and put on the fracture a splint larger and stronger than the others, and let there be one inch of space between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it passes the fracture three inches on each side;
then pull on the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, more strongly and less by moving away.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, at the time that you restore the broken limb, and you fear a hot abscess, then let it be left to heal until the seventh day, as we have said;
then examine every three days the bandage, that itching or swelling does not come there, or that nourishment cannot come to the limb because it is too tight. If so, redress it, as we have said.
And if no such accident occurs, then do not unbind it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, and have his hands on his stomach;
and place under the shoulder a cushion full of wool evenly, and check every hour of the day or night, that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bandages are not loosened;
then redress it by the power of medicine, and give him the food that we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is at first subtle; and when he begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be completely healed in forty days; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and ointments to heal the place.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it remains unbound for fifty days or two months.
of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "foscile," of which one is small, and it is the one that follows the elbow;
and the other is large, and it is the one that is below, towards the little finger;
by chance the large foscile alone is broken, or the small one, and by chance both together.
When the small foscile is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is difficult, and more serious than when both are broken together.
If it is the small foscile that is broken alone, then it should be slightly extended and set even.
And if it is the large foscile, then it should be pulled more strongly;
and extend it on a cushion, and hold the little finger of the hand higher than the others, and the little toe lower than the other toes, and let the patient be crossed over himself, and a cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient suffers no discomfort;
then let the attendant extend his arm to the part below his hand, or to a sling, and another attendant to the other above.
And then let the physician set it even, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture there are pieces, then put each one in its place, and if there is any separated one that touches the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut it and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in a separate chapter; then take care of it.
And if at the beginning of the resetting, hot abscesses occur, then apply a cloth of cerate made of rose oil and white wax, which should be neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the cloth on subtly, until the hot abscesses are calmed.
And then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster of the mill's powder with plenty of egg, then apply the splints, and let the splint of the fracture always be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several positions: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two;
and bind more tightly above the fracture than elsewhere, and always less tightly as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the cloths that are over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the cloths that are over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the binding after a few days. And if any bad accident occurs to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must irrigate the limb with warm water until that itching is calmed;
and do not let the limb rest tightly bound.
And then recommence the binding, and if the binding is loosened and the bone separated, and similar things, then correct it.
And then see if nourishment cannot reach the limb, because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it so for a few days, until nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not unbind it until twenty days.
or around, then hang his hands around his neck, and let his shoulders be even, and beware of movement and fidgeting, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-five, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the compositions and complexions of the virtues.
Of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and in the knuckles of the fingers, few fractures occur, and only bending happens many times.
And when the palm of the hand is broken or bent, it is necessary that the patient sit cross-legged, and sits straight in front of him equally;
then he puts his hand on the stretched cloth, and the minister stretches the broken bones, and puts them equal with the ruler, until they are well joined;
and puts the plaster and the lint, if no abscesses come, then he puts a splint according to the size of the place; and let it be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the inside around the belly of the palm, he makes a splint of cloths, and instructs the patient to bind it to his broken palm; and then binds it with a long cloth, and let the splint be of soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as is necessary.
And if the fracture is on the outside, then you must put one splint on top, and another underneath on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and tighten the binding between the fingers.
And if the fracture is in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the thumb, set it straight as necessary; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, put a small straight splint to lift the fracture, and it will not move;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index finger or one of the others, set it straight, and bind it with the healthy finger that is next to it; or you bind them all together in an I shape, whichever is better, or you put on a splint, as with the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and the treatment of a hot abscess, and help what comes from it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and one sees it well when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is that one binds one linen above the break, and another below. And the patient lies on his face, then each attendant extends his linen to his part equally;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is near the root of the thigh, let one of the linens be towards the groin, and the other linen below the fracture.
And similarly if it is near the knee, then let the linen be near the knee, and let the extension be below;
then let the surgeon set the bone straight with his two hands, until it is according to its natural form, and then apply the plaster, and bind it, if no abscesses form.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside, then return to your work and your treatment; The bandage is made in this manner.
It is necessary that you wrap around the fracture a hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the buttock, and put a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come to the top;
then turn the bandage over the leg and over the thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the bone of the leg;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to make the tightening even, then begin to bind firmly three or four turns over the fracture; and the higher you go above the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then take the two ends of the thread that you put between the leg and the thigh, and tie the three splints that are on top, then go back down to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it thus, until neither an abscess nor swelling nor anything similar appears. And if it happens, then unbind it, and treat what appears there, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that protrude, it is necessary to remove them, if one can; and if one cannot, it is necessary to cut open the area and pull out the splinters; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are applied, as in the shoulder and arm;
nevertheless, in the restoration thus made the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in L days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of complexions.
Know that in the kneecap there is little breakage, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is only a fissure, or a hole, and happens with a wound, and without a wound, and this one feels well.
And the restoration is that one puts what is round to its place, as much as it can be assembled;
then put the plaster, and put a round splint there, if you need it, and bind it as is necessary, then observe all the provisions that we have said in other fractures, such as a hot abscess and other similar things; then apply to each accident what it requires, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is rightly called "mustelz", and the other is called "foscile";
and the same fracture occurs as in the arm, and therefore the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is the same. And if the two bones are broken together, then the leg turns in all directions.
And if the thin bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, one feels great pain, and one sees it well; and it turns underneath.
Then administer extension, and set it straight, and bind the splints evenly;
but however, if the fracture is bad, and there are several pieces, the extension must be smaller and lighter; and ease it according to your ability.
And when you have completed your work, take two wooden splints that encompass the leg on one side and the other, and are the length of the leg from the knee down;
then wrap in two places one bandage above and below, and bind it in the middle also, and with this binding the leg cannot deviate to the right or to the left, and so it is well;
and some administer a splint the length of the leg, and it is of wood, and in it one places the leg to prevent movement, and properly this is done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other complication; then cure it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle, no fracture occurs, but at the bones of the foot, fracture sometimes occurs and at the toes also, and there is nothing but a crack in most instances.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping each other, then have the patient put his foot on the ground, as if he were going to walk, and then immediately put your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their place;
then apply the plaster and lint, and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two full sides, then bind it to the foot firmly, after you have wrapped cloths around, and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether they were broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then place on the broken toe a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot that board that I have mentioned, and bind it firmly;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, then place on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it be resting on the top of the board over the instep, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have said about other fractures, as we have said; and treat each complication as is necessary.
of the fracture of the bone of the wrist
When the bone of a woman's nature is broken, make her sit upright, then incline her to the back, and let her be held from behind;
then fill the patient's vagina with cotton, and put in as much as it will hold;
then stand the woman up, and lift her back little by little, and then the cotton will jump, until it comes to the entrance of the vagina, and the bone will return with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back, and do this for seven days or so: the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a chain to the opening, and put the whole bladder into the vagina; then blow strongly into the chain until the bladder is inflated inside: the fracture will return to its place;
then it should be filled with cotton, and leave it like that for a few days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the man's or woman's wrist is broken, restore it as we have said for the hip bone;
and these fractures are not hidden from one who studies and practices, and understands my book.
For the fracture shows in many ways the right way to restoration: Understand this then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's gullet and put the penis inside it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it like that for three days, and it will be healed quickly.
Of fracture with wound
It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as a bone of the thigh or shoulder or similar, that it be healed immediately, so that the healings which we have mentioned show.
And if the wound heals, then staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin again to restore the fracture at that same hour, or that day, if hot abscesses do not come.
And if hot abscesses come, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscesses are subsided, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause bad accidents.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the uncovered heart, it is necessary that you put it in place lightly with your hands, with slight extension.
And if extension is not sufficient to put it in place with your hands, then reset it with this iron instrument, which is seven or eight fingers long, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the surgeon to have three or four, according to what he needs for each fracture treatment;
and let it be round and somewhat thick, so that it does not bend under compression on the limb during your work, and let it be pointed in front, and thick from the middle forward, thus:
And it is called a "palainche," therefore it is necessary that the curved head be placed on the head of the apparent bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and is even on both sides. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot easily grasp the bone, then you must cut the head of the bone, until the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot reset the bone, as we have said, then cut it with an instrument suitable for this, either an incisor or a saw, as you are able;
then remove what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reset, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place.
So do this until it is in its place, then moisten a cloth in black styptic wine, and properly if it is in summer; and do not put on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption;
then apply lint when you have reset the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted with the fracture;
and many times foolish physicians have done this, and have brought upon the patient either death or sometimes corrosion; and let the bandages be softer and gentler than for other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that a bad accident may occur, as we have said, and you find pain in the place, then you must not put on lint; but wrap around, instead of lint, hard cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming at the wound, remove what you have put on with wine, and apply an ointment that heals wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is necessary that you unbind the limb twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, until it is healed and sound.
And it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but continues to produce pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, wherefore it is necessary that you probe the wound with a tent, and remove all those separated pieces that cause that pain.
And if a fistula forms at the site, or another kind of corruption, then it is necessary that you cure it, according to what is said in the chapter above.
And when the bone is broken, and is open on the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or of the shoulder, and others similar of the large limbs, then do not extract it, for many times death results, but leave it until it festers;
by chance it will fall out after twenty or thirty days, then cure the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
Many times after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, and it is a dreadful thing to see the shape of the limb; and perchance the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take care then if the bone is fresh: then administer styptic medicines, such as aloes, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocol, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and apply them to the wound on tampons, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days;
and apply them to the wound on tampons, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days; and then unbind it, and begin another, until the inflammation is removed;
or you bind on a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the inflammation is already converted into hardness like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut it, and remove the apparent excess; or you scrape it with a razor, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb which is weak after healing
When the fracture of the bone is healed, and the limb remains weak and thin afterwards, this happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of excessive washing; or because of too much movement, and not at the right time; or because he has little blood in his body, and is weak.
And the cure is that you make the patient eat, and make the body soft, until the blood is multiplied in him; and administer a bath, and give him joy and happiness;
then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch draws great nourishment to it, and often water it with warm water, until the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
of the limb twisted after the healing When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bones are exposed, and the shape of the limb is ugly, nevertheless it does not lose its natural function:
do not believe the fools who say that one must break the limb anew, and many foolish physicians have done this in our land;
and this practice is condemned, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
however, if the knots and the twisting are fresh, then they must be bathed in warm water, or softening herbs should be cooked, such as mallow leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon, and you take the mucilage of mallow, and you mix it with chicken fat or linseed oil, and make a plaster on top;
or you take fat figs, and crush them with pigeon dung, and similar medicines that reduce swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with wet hands. And let movement be given to the limb every hour.
And if the tortuosity is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut to the bone, with a sharp, light incisor; and put care and diligence into the treatment.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, which prevents it from moving, and the limb is misaligned, causing the patient great pain and injury.
When a dislocation occurs in someone, it must be reduced immediately without delay.
For if one delays, the place swells, and perhaps one then reduces it with difficulty;
therefore one must not move it when it is swollen: it often causes spasms and other pains;
however, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave him until the abscesses are reduced;
then bathe the limb in warm water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as it comes back into place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
It happens that the jaws are dislocated on both sides, and the dislocation of both is according to two ways: or they are a little removed from their places, and softened a little; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the breast, and the saliva runs from the mouth so that he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is entangled with speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns by itself in many dispositions.
And if it is complete and accomplished, then you must reset it quickly, and not delay;
and in such a manner that the assistant holds the head of the patient, and puts the middle finger of one of his hands into the root of the dislocation of the mandible inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on two sides; and the other two fingers of the hand should be outside, to make it even;
and instruct the patient to soften his jaw, and move it in all directions. And the middle finger puts it even, until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if it is the two mandibles together, then bathe them with warm water and oil, until they soften slightly;
and do not delay in the reduction, as we have said.
And when they are equally reduced, and the patient's mouth closes well without softening, then apply cloths moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on his back, and his head be placed between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or to the left, nor does he strain to chew, but let him take light food, until the pains are removed, and the mandibles are knit;
and then let him eat what he wants lightly, and let him not exert himself in opening his mouth to eat and drink, until the mandible is well knit and healed.
And if the two mandibles cannot be set at once, and are not returned to their places, then there comes fever and accustomed swelling, and perchance looseness of the bowels, and perchance vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is destruction; and many times he who it happens to dies within nine days.
The clavicle cannot be dislocated inwards towards the continuation of it and the breast, and it is sometimes dislocated outwards, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and extends his arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then apply the plaster and bandage it, and bind it tightly;
and the head which is towards the rib cannot be dislocated; except perhaps a little, and if it dislocates sometimes, then reset it to its place, as we have said;
then apply the plaster and bandage it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and in the same way is the head of the shoulder reset, when it is separated from its place.
Of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated only in three ways:
one is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and by chance it dislocates upwards, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind the shoulder, nor does it dislocate inwards because of the nerves;
and many times it dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in them it jumps easily;
in those who have enough flesh, it jumps with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And by chance it happens to some men that there is a percussion or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and it is thought that it is dislocated because of this.
It is necessary then that you test it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is lowered towards the armpit, and it shows a difference between the diseased shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a manifest difference between them; and you will find at the head of the shoulder a hollow, and under the armpit, on touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move it in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it manifestly on touching;
and this type of dislocation is not difficult to reset, when it is recent, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the attendant raises the patient's hand upwards, then puts his thumbs under the armpit, and raises the joint forcefully upwards into place; and the attendant raises the hand and extends it upwards, then puts it underneath; it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then the patient must be bathed in warm water; and the attendant should apply a softening and soothing poultice, such as a decoction of mallow and fenugreek and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
then let the patient be placed on his back, and place under the armpit an even wool pad, neither too soft nor too hard, then let the physician place his heel on the pad, and raise the head of the shoulder skillfully, and pull the patient's hand;
and another attendant should hold the patient's head so that it does not move downwards; that shoulder will return immediately, and if you wish, reset it in this manner:
and that you have present a man who is larger than the patient; and let him be positioned towards the side, and place his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and raise the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another attendant pull the patient's hand downwards towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, let him hang with some heavy thing, and the dislocation will return immediately.
And it is reset also in another manner:
and that is, one thrusts a long firebrand into the ground, of which the head should be as round as a pestle, and neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but so that he has soft cloths above, and the patient is standing along the length of the stick;
then his hand is pulled down forcefully on the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return for all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a firebrand two spans long and four fingers wide, which has a round head to enter easily deeply under the armpit, according to this form:
then tie soft cloths to the head of the stick, so that the stick does not injure the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm along the length of the stick, and tie the shoulder to the stick, and the arm to the head of the hand, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder of suitable width, and let the hands hang down, and let the body hang down on the other side: the joint will return immediately.
And when it is in, in whatever way it may be, you must place under the armpit an even layer of wool, then apply the prepared plaster of mill dust, with incense and egg white, over the whole shoulder and around, then bind it firmly under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and embrace the hand to the neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And it is necessary that he eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal more quickly;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place because of moisture that has come there, or for another reason, you must administer cautery to three points, as it is described in the chapter on cautery.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is towards the breast, and the nipples, or the back, is caused by impact and stretching of the hands, and another treatment is administered there;
and treat until it is healed.
And if after healing there is stiffness in the limb, and slowness in movement, let the patient use baths many times, until that stiffness is lessened, and returns to its original nature.
of the dislocation of the rib
Know that the joint of the rib is dislocated with difficulty, and returns with difficulty;
and it is dislocated on all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not hidden, for one sees it well and feels it well; and dislocated according to each form. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is broken, and he cannot bend his arm, nor touch his shoulder at all.
And you must reset it before hot abscesses come, for if hot abscesses came, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps it cannot be completely reset at all, especially when it is at the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is more painful, and sometimes death results.
And the restoration is, when it is such that it can be reset, that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arms are spread, and the hands of the patient according to the length around, above and below, and put the joint to his knuckles together, or to the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pushes from the root of the palm along the length that is dislocated.
And if it will not return to its place, administer strong extension;
and it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm on each side, after you have wrapped a long and wide double cloth;
and when the physician has joined the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly, until it returns;
and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm around the patient's neck, and leave it for some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, unbind the bandage, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not hold well, redo the plaster and the bandage, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly set; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the resetting of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is relieved; or you place on the joint a poultice of fat mutton, then leave it one day and one night, then remove it, and have him enter the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint moderately, then replace the poultice, and then enter the bath; and thus do it two or three times, until he is healed;
and if you wish, put on warm, moistened cow dung with butter, and bind it on;
then it will return to its proper place.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its reduction is easier than other joints. However, it must be returned to its place quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the place is swollen, or a hot abscess forms there.
And the reduction is that you place the afflicted hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and you place it evenly, so that he places his palm on the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, it is necessary that you look to see if it is well in place; then the patient places the back of his hand on a table for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient places the back of his hand on the table, and the physician places his hand on that appearance of the joint.
If it returns immediately, it is well. If not, restrain it with soothing plasters, warm poultices, and leave it thus without restarting.
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it in place after a few days, the joint remains twisted;
and it harms the patient not at all except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerves are severed, or the arteries;
then there is no other remedy except to cauterize near the case, and perhaps nothing else helps.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have described, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it so.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, moisten it with warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
Of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly;
Then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then set it even on that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and bind it at night;
and do this often, until it is tight, and do likewise if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed;
and do likewise, when it is dislocated elsewhere.
Of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or of the neck is dislocated, or there are several dislocations, there is no cure, for death quickly claims the patient.
And the sign is that the excretions leap forth without will, nor can he retain them, and often some limbs are softened, either the two thighs or the two arms or one.
And many times the spine moves in four directions;
That which moves to the rear is called "gibbosity":
The cure is that you observe if the gibbosity came from infancy: if there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from a fall or from blows or similar things, the ancients described methods of cure with great words, where there is not much profit in all;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have devised instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gibbosity that comes to the breast in front, there is no device or remedy;
and also that which comes straight on two sides, and one cannot cure except that which properly comes to the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient be laid on his face in one even place, and have a bolster under him, that he not be injured;
then stick one firebrand firmly in the ground at the head, and another at the feet, and tie one rope across the armpits of the patient, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants hold the ropes, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two firebrands;
and they should be well fastened, the firebrands as we have said, and the physician place his palms on the spine firmly, until it returns.
And if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and the patient be on his side, and place the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician put his feet on the other end of the board, and press well, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with a lathe that turns by hand. And it is that you place two firebrands at the head of the patient of a great arm's length, and towards the feet two others, and there should be between each firebrand, above and below, a palm's breadth of space in length;
and let there be in each firebrand one hole where the lathe runs, and let the firebrands be firmly in the earth, so that they do not move;
and between each two firebrands let there be one turning firebrand, upon which the ropes turn, and let there be on the two turners two small firebrands of a palm's length, to turn the lathe;
and then tie the rope which is through the armpits to the lathe towards the head, and the other rope towards the feet to the other lathe, and each of the assistants turns his lathe with all the rope, and the master places the spine evenly as we have said.
And when it is even, he puts on a drying plaster with egg white, and then the lint, and then a splint of a tablet three fingers long, which covers the place of the gibbosity and the part of the healthy spine, then binds it with a rope, as we have said, and the patient uses light nourishment, until he is healed;
and if anything comes at the end of the healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned above; and sometimes one administers a piece of lead, and sometimes the appearance comes in the posterior spine of the back, and one thinks that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone which appears, wherefore one should not be presumptuous: by chance it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and at the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations occur, not as in other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated according to four parts: inwards and outwards, and forwards and backwards;
and more inwards than elsewhere, and slightly dislocated forwards and backwards.
And the recognition of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the diseased leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the diseased knee appears more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his knee to the fire; and the place which is nearby is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of that which comes outwards, is that these symptoms are contrary to those above.
And the signs of that which happens in front, are that he extends his leg well according to its length; however, he does not bend his knee without pain, and if one wants to make it go, it cannot go forward, and he retains his urine, and the groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.
And the signs of him to whom it happens behind, are that he cannot extend his knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place under the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you observe if the dislocation is old, and if it remains according to its disposition, then there is no cure; and it is not necessary that there be presumption.
And in one in whom the dislocation is fresh, and this is of the four types of dislocation, hasten that you turn the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; by chance it will return, and there is no need for other treatment.
And if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a linen cloth tied above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand above in such a way that he puts his hands under his armpits, then binds him with a soft cloth above the thigh; and another holds the head of the linen;
and they extend upwards and downwards all at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to the four similar cases, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is well.
If not, then it is necessary to apply treatment to its likeness.
When the dislocation is inward, you must place the patient on his healthy side, then place the linen on the root of the thigh, and the place which is below the groin, then extend the linen upwards towards the groin, and towards the hip joint;
then let another assistant take his arms, and embrace the large part of the affected thigh, and extend it outwards strongly; then it will return to its place immediately;
and this type of dislocation is easier than others.
And if you cannot set it in the manner we have described, you must bind the patient's two feet together with a strong, soft linen, above the two heels and above the two knees, and let the affected leg be extended two fingers more than the other;
then let it be hung from the top of a beam, and let it be two arm-lengths above the ground;
then instruct an assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who firmly embraces the thigh, for the joint returns immediately and quickly.
And when the dislocation is reduced, let the patient lie down, as we have said for someone with gibbosity, and tie a linen bandage tightly around the affected leg and also the foot;
then place two firebrands, one at the head and another at the feet, then place a firebrand between the patient's thighs in the middle of the groin; and have moistened cloths placed around so that it does not burn the patient, then let each assistant extend towards him, and the physician should equally set the dislocation with his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, place it on a table, and press it as we have said in the case of gibbosity, and let the patient lie on the healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the affected leg quickly, and as I have said; and let the physician place his effort on the affected angle, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the affected limb downwards, nor to raise it from the ground, but it should be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said concerning lying on the two hips; and let him be on his face, and the limb extended as we have said above, and one must press on the joint at the table; and it will be right when the patient extends his legs, and they are even; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and let it rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster again;
and if you see that they are even, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and have him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
Of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forwards.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not bend to his thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend his leg if he can, and put your back against his face, and put his foot on your feet;
then take his knee in your palms, and pull it between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he bends his leg easily to his thigh;
and put the plaster on, and bind the leg to the thigh, and bind them together tightly for three or four days, then unbind it;
and let the patient not work or walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not straight, administer strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes moved, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inwards and outwards.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and tense towards the part where it is dislocated:
The reduction is easy, and one should extend it gently with one's hands when it is only moved.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and hold him firmly by the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left twice, then extend it upwards, and gently place the foot upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot;
If it returns, it is well;
If not, then begin the process again, for it returns;
and if it cannot return thus, then have the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly stick a stake in the ground between his thighs, and tie cloths around it, so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a rope, which he ties above the ankle; then let each assistant extend equally, and the stake should always be between the patient's thighs to restrain the patient when he is extended;
then let the physician set the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, apply the plaster and lint, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves that are on the ankle behind, that the binding not be too tight;
then leave it two or three days, and if the binding loosens, tighten it;
then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if hot abscesses occur there, you must soothe them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently extended without force, and that is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any of the bones of the back of the foot, you must have the patient sit on a flat surface or on a completely straight table, and place your foot on the exposed part of the joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
and when it is even, and nothing appears there, place a two-legged stool under the sole of the foot, then bind it tightly, and leave it for three days, then unbind it; and make him rest until he is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound occurs with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
therefore do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not patient and merciful and slow, not rash;
and use at the beginning soothing things for a hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands, if you see no hope of healing; and when you see hope, then immediately restore the limb to its place, before the hot abscesses come there;
and when the limb is in place, administer things soothing to a hot abscess, and treat the wound, as is necessary, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then remove them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses;
and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, according to what I have said, for it is worth more to you according to your Creator, and for the salvation of your soul and your body.
