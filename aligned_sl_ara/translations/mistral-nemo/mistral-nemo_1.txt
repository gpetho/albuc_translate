I composed this book for you, my sons, having completed it in its entirety as a part of the science of medicine. Having achieved clarity and explanation in it, I have seen fit to complete it for you with this chapter on manual surgery, which is a part of practice.
Indeed, the art of manual surgery in our land and time has become completely absent such that its science was nearly lost and forgotten. But there remain only a few rough sketches in the books of the ancients, obscured by hands and erased by errors and confusion such that their meanings are concealed and their usefulness is lost.
Therefore, I have seen fit to revive this art and compose this chapter on it with clear explanation, detailed description, and summary, and to include illustrations of surgical instruments and other tools used in practice.
The reason why there is no skilled craftsman of this art in our time is because the practice of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must first be proficient in the science of anatomy described by Galen. So that he may know the functions of organs, their structures, humors, connections and disconnections, the bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers and outlets, and the veins and arteries with their exits.
Therefore, as it is said, 'there are many physicians in name but few in deed,' especially in the art of manual surgery. We have mentioned this briefly at the beginning of this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned regarding anatomy will surely fall into errors that kill people, as I have often witnessed many who claim to practice this art without knowledge or skill.
I once saw an ignorant doctor cut into a woman's neck to remove a swelling, damaging some of the vessels in her neck and causing her to bleed to death in his hands.
I saw another doctor who attempted to remove a large kidney stone from a man who had suffered abdominal stabbing, but in his haste he removed a piece of the bladder along with it. The man died three days later. When I was called to remove the stone, I saw its great size and understood how he had come to such a state.
I saw another doctor who earned his living among some lords of our land in medicine.
The doctor quickly, due to his ignorance, set the fracture on the wound near the heel using bandages and splints tied tightly without allowing any space for the wound to breathe.
Then he released him to his desires, left him for days, and ordered that the bandage not be loosened until his leg and foot swelled and approached ruin.
So I went to him and quickly untied the bandage, relieving his pain. But the corruption had already taken hold in the member, and I was unable to restore it.
Thus corruption spread throughout the limb until it perished.
I saw another doctor cauterize a cancerous tumor on someone's buttock. He performed the operation after several days until the patient's condition worsened, for if a cancer is purely from black bile, it should never be treated with iron.
Except when the entire member can be removed.
So know this, my son: work with the hand is divided into two categories - that which is accompanied by safety and that which is accompanied by harm in most cases.
And I have warned you throughout this book about operations that involve danger and fear, so you must avoid them and reject them.
So that the ignorant may not find an opportunity for speech and criticism. Therefore, be cautious and careful in your treatments, and gentle and steadfast with your patients.
And choose the safest and most preferable method leading to safety and favorable outcome. Avoid dangerous and difficult diseases that you cannot treat.
And keep yourselves away from what you fear may cause doubt in your religion and worldly life. It is better for you to leave it alone, as it raises your status in this life and the hereafter.
As Galen said in some of his advice: 'Do not treat evil diseases lest you become known as evil physicians.'

The First Chapter
On Hemorrhoids
Before mentioning its use, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms and in what constitution it is used.
I say that the discussion on the benefits and harms of Kîy is lengthy, subtle, precise knowledge, and many wise men have spoken about it.
And they differed in their opinions; I have summarized a little from what they said to avoid lengthening.
I say that Kîy generally benefits all bad constitutions, with or without matter, especially hot constitutions without matter and dry ones without matter.
As for dry constitutions with matter, they differed about it. Some said that Kîy is beneficial in it, while others said the opposite, that Kîy is not suitable in a disease resulting from heat and dryness because fire's nature is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to treat a hot, dry disease with a hot, dry remedy. The one who said the opposite claimed that Kîy can benefit a hot, dry disease occurring in people's bodies because of fire. For when you add moisture to fire, you make the body cold.
And I say that because I have experienced it many times, but it is not appropriate for anyone to think this way except those who are experienced and trained in the art of Kîy. And he stood on the variety of constitutions among people, the conditions of diseases within them, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for other constitutions, there is no fear of them for you, especially cold, moist diseases; all physicians agree on their benefit from Kîy and do not differ.
Know, O sons, that the secret of treating with Kîy by fire and its superiority over Kîy with a burned medicine is that fire is a simple substance whose effect does not extend beyond the part cauterized, and it scarcely harms any other connected part.
The application of burning drugs may extend its effect to nearby organs, and it might cause diseases in the member that are difficult to treat, or perhaps even cause death. Fire, due to its nobility and precious nature, does not do this unless one has been excessive.
And we have verified this through long experience in the practice of surgery and careful attention to the facts.
Therefore, I have omitted lengthy discourse; otherwise, it would not befit this book of mine to conceal from you the secret and mysterious nature of fire's action on bodies and its expulsion of diseases, lest I should perplex your understanding with philosophical arguments.
And know, O my sons, that physicians have disagreed about the appropriate time for cautery, and they considered the season of spring to be the most suitable time.
I say that cautery may be performed at any time because the harm caused by time is outweighed by the benefit derived from cautery. Especially if the cautery is for a severe, urgent and persistent pain that cannot be delayed, lest worse consequences follow than the slight harm caused by time.
And do not think, O my sons, as the common people and foolish physicians imagine, that cautery which cures a certain disease is a definitive cure without any recurrence.
For cautery is merely like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries up the humors that cause pain.
However, cautery surpasses medicine in its swift effect, powerful strength, and forceful control.
At times, the disease may return depending on the temperament of the patient, the severity of their condition, and the strength of their constitution, as well as factors such as their diet and other causes.
God forbid that cautery should be used for a light disease or in an organ of little importance and humidity. Such as the cauterization of a toothache, which may not return, especially if it is minor.
And the saying of the common people that cautery is the last resort of medicine is correct, not because they believe that no treatment will work after cautery has been performed.
And indeed, 'The Kye is the last resort of medicine' means that when we have used various remedies in treating an illness and they did not help, then we use the last resort of Kye and it works. Henceforth, Kye is considered the last resort of medicine. And not according to the meaning that has been understood by the common people and many ignorants among physicians.
It was mentioned by earlier authors that gold Kye is better than iron Kye. They said this because of the warmth and nobility of gold, claiming that it does not cause inflammation at the site of cauterization. This is not true.
Because I have tested it and found that it does not act equally on all bodies. Gold Kye is indeed better than iron, as they claimed, except that when you heat the cautery in fire made of gold, you cannot tell exactly when it reaches the desired temperature for its warmth.
Because it quickly cools down, and even if you increase its heat in the fire, it melts and the smith becomes confused by that. Therefore, iron Kye is quicker and more accurate for use, if God wills.
I have arranged this chapter on cautery into sections ordered from head to foot to make it easy for the student to find what he needs, if God wills.
Chapter One.
There is one type of Kye for the head.
This Kye is useful for excessive dampness and coldness in the brain, which are causes of headaches, frequent congestion in the head reaching to the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and sore throat. In summary, it is used for all diseases caused by coldness such as paralysis, epilepsy, and shivering, etc.
The shape of this Kye is that you should first order the patient to evacuate using a purgative laxative suitable for the head, three or four nights in accordance with the patient's strength and age.
Then, order him to shave his head with a razor, then make him sit facing you while squatting, placing his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your hand on the bridge of his nose between his eyes. Where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the copper cautery that is of this shape.
Expose bone to the size of a chickpea or a grain of barley, then raise your hand and do not hesitate; prepare another spatula or use another one if it has cooled down. Until you see the bone as mentioned earlier, then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a cotton pad in it. Place it on the location and leave it for three days.
Then place a cotton pad soaked in oil on it, leaving it until the crackling sound stops. Then treat it with the four-element plaster until it heals, God willing.
It has been said that the longer a wound remains open, the better and more beneficial it is for the pus to discharge.
Some have mentioned that they cauterize the skin until it reaches the bone and keep the cautery there until some of the thickness of the bone gets burned. Then they scrape off what has been burnt from the bone, after which they treat it.
Others have stated that one should exaggerate cauterization until it strongly affects the bone, causing a portion of the bone to collapse like a small ring or button. They claimed that this releases the headache's vapor from that location and leaves the wound open for an extended period.
Then treat it until it heals, but I do not find these two types of cauterization beneficial except in some cases. The safer option is to leave it alone; when the natural connection breaks, as we have seen in other parts of the body, inflammation occurs.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak; the first type of cauterization is the safest and best in my opinion, so use it and be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
On cauterizing the head.
If persistent headache occurs in the head, lasting for a long time without improvement despite using remedies, poultices, fumigations, ointments, and bandages – especially if cauterization with the single cautery described earlier did not help – then examine. If the patient's head is strong by nature and not weak, but feels extreme coldness, cauterize it with another cautery slightly above the first one. Then burn each corner of his head with a cautery until the skin thickens and the bone underneath is exposed, as described (before). Burn him with a cautery on the back of his head at the spot called the "nape" and be gentle in this, without exposing the bone, for he finds this cautery very painful unlike other head cauteries which I will mention later.
The cautery used for burning the corners of the head and the nape should be milder than that used for the middle of the head, and this is its shape.
Chapter Three.
Treating non-chronic headaches.
If pain occurs in a head wound accompanied by headache and the pain extends to the eye, evacuate the patient with diuretics for the head and use other treatments mentioned in the chapters on diseases. If this does not succeed, cauterize him on two sides (of the head). Either by cautery with a hot drug or with iron.
As for cauterization with the hot drug, take one garlic clove, peel it, cut off its ends on both sides, then make an incision on the painful side of the temple with a wide scalpel until a space is created under the skin sufficient to accommodate the garlic.
Insert it under the skin until it disappears, then tie it with a linen bandage and leave it for about fifteen hours. Then remove the garlic and allow the wound to heal for two or three days before dressing it.
Then dress it with cotton soaked in oil until the wound becomes inflamed, then treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If you wish, you can do this with some of the cauterizing drugs mentioned in the eighteenth chapter on cauterizing drugs.
And as for cauterization with iron, it is done in this manner using an iron of this shape:
It is called the "mismariyya" cautery because its head is like a nail with some swelling and it has a small groove in its center.
Then place the cautery on the painful spot and hold your hand steady while you turn the iron slightly, burning to a depth equal to half the thickness of the skin. Raise your hand so that you do not burn the artery that is below, and thus cause bleeding. Then immerse a bandage in saltwater and apply it to the spot, leaving it for three days. Then remove the bandage with fat, then treat it with ointment until it heals, if Allah wills.
If you wish, cauterize this ulcer with the sharp end of a glowing coal from the fire, taking care not to cut the artery in this non-chronic ulcer.
Chapter Four.
In treating chronic ulcers.
If the treatment of ulcers that we have mentioned does not prove effective, and you see signs of the illness that are not covered by what has been mentioned regarding cauterization with fire or cauterization with medication. It is necessary to heat the pointed iron until it becomes white, then apply it on the spot of pain with a line about half a finger's length or similar, and leave your hand once while pulling it so that it cuts the artery and reaches close to the bone.
But you should be careful not to touch the movable jawbone while biting, so as not to burn its muscle or motor nerve and cause stiffness.
And beware of the bleeding from the artery that you cut, for in cutting it there is danger. Especially for those who are ignorant and have not practiced this craft, leaving the task to others.
And the method of treating sudden bleeding from an artery on the face will be mentioned in its place in this book, if Allah wills. If you see signs of the illness that are not covered by this cauterization.
And if you find the patient's body tolerating it, perform cautery in the middle of the head as described and treat the wound until it heals, if Allah wills.
If you wish, you can use the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on tying off an artery with a double-pointed iron; it is better and more effective than this one.
Chapter Five.
In treating earache.
If an earache occurs due to cold, and it is treated with laxatives and other treatments mentioned in this section but the pain persists, heat the iron called 'al-Nuktah' which has this shape.
Then prick it with this after heating around both ears entirely as it rotates, or around them all if the pain is in both. Then keep it a little away from the root of the ear after marking the spot with ink, and let the cautery be about ten points in each ear or thereabouts, then treat the spots until they heal, if Allah wills.
Chapter Six
In cauterization.
The phlegm that is treated by cautery is of the type that occurs as described in the sections on diseases.
And avoid cauterizing types that result from concavity and nerve spasm.
If you have treated this type of phlegm with remedies, syrups, and decoctions but found them ineffective, then it is permissible to cauterize the patient three times. Once at the root of the ear, second below it slightly near the cheekbone, and third at the meeting point of the lips.
Make your cautery on the opposite side of the affected area, for relaxation occurs only on the healthy side that appears sound.
The form of cautery should be two cauteries facing the tip of the upper ear slightly below the vertex of the head, and another on the cheekbone, each about the length of a finger joint.
Lower your hand with the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin, and this is the form of the cautery, which is a type of spatula that was previously depicted, though it is somewhat smoother as shown. The spatula should have a blade slightly thicker than the rest, then treat the spot with what has been mentioned until it heals, if Allah wills.
Chapter Seven
In cauterizing chronic ulcers.
If the ulcer has become chronic and you have treated it with what was mentioned but found no effect, and there is no fever in the patient, then cauterize four times. Once on each temple, once at the crown of the head as mentioned earlier, and once at the back of the head as previously described.
And the recipe for cauterization as mentioned earlier; also, you can cauterize once on the stomach's mouth and apply more ointment, then treat with what has been mentioned.
Chapter Eight
In Forgetfulness
If it is due to phlegm, it is advisable that the patient first be given large quantities of diuretics and brain-purifying drugs.
Then his entire head should be shaved, and a poultice of mustard plaster written in the chapter on ulcers should be applied to it repeatedly, for this is one method of treating forgetfulness.
And do this on the precise spot mentioned earlier; for it will cure him, God willing. If not, then perform cupping three times at the back of his head from the top to below the neck.
And place between each cupping a finger's width apart, then treat the forgetfulness as previously mentioned. If you wish to increase it and the patient is able to tolerate it, perform an additional central cupping.
If you wish to increase [the treatment], then perform cupping on the ears also, and treat him until he is cured. The cups should be made of brass, as described previously.
Chapter Nine
In Paralysis and General Weakness of the Body
It is advisable to begin by purging the head with diuretics and other treatments mentioned earlier, then shave the patient's head and perform cupping once in the center of the head, once on each ear, and once at the back of the neck.
And three times on the nape of the neck. If you need to perform more cupping for a case of general weakness and the patient is able to tolerate it, and the illness is severe and well-established, then perform four cups on the backbone. Inform him about the cupping until it burns more of the skin, then lift your hand and treat him as previously mentioned until he is cured, God willing. The cups should be made of brass.
Chapter Ten
In Epilepsy
Only perform cupping on an epileptic whose seizures are due to phlegm. It is advisable to first purge his brain with large diuretics and other treatments mentioned earlier if the patient is able to tolerate taking drugs.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate drugs, then use the brain-purging gruel and syrup for many days before cupping, along with improving his diet.
Then he shaves his head and applies the first cautery iron in the middle of the head as mentioned earlier, and another cautery iron at the back. And on each horn of his head, cautery irons are applied. If the patient is strong and can withstand it, cauterize them as mentioned in "The Paralytic". Relax the body over the cervical spine and thoracic vertebrae. The cautery iron should be oily as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery iron mild like this.
Chapter Eleven.
On Melancholia.
If the cause of melancholy is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, cauterize with the irons mentioned in "The Paralytic".
If the cause of melancholy is an inclination towards black bile and the patient's body is moist and corrupt, then cleanse his brain as previously mentioned in division.
Then shave the patient's head, make a tight cap of linen like a crown, and place it on his head while he is sitting cross-legged, holding it from all sides. Then take one spoonful of old sheep fat.
Heat it gently over the fire until it can be tolerated by touching with a finger, then pour it into the cap on his head and leave it until it cools. Repeat this process once every week along with other good treatments until he recovers, if Allah wills.
If you wish, cauterize him with many small punctures without holding the iron in your hand, but rather touching lightly. This type of cautery moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply to him a linen cloth soaked in sheep fat or chicken grease.
Chapter Twelve.
On Cauterization for Watery Eye Discharge.
If you find that watery eye discharge has begun with the signs mentioned in division, hurry to cleanse the patient's head and warm him up from all humidities. Wash him in the bathhouse on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head, cauterize him with one iron in the middle of his head, and two irons on the temples if both eyes are affected. If only one eye is affected, cauterize on that side alone.
Then cut with the scalpel all veins and arteries that are under the skin, let the incisions be long in width of a fingerbreadth on both cheeks, and take care not to cause bleeding.
If you find any of it, then cut it off at the point with whatever treatment is available to you. We will come later to the wisdom in tying the vessels and cutting them while taking care not to cause bleeding.
You should make two incisions under the bone on either side of the spine.
Chapter Thirteen.
On Chronic Weeping.
If the tears from the eye are chronic and continuous, and it has been ascertained that this is due to cold humors rising from the brain through the veins and arteries on the surface of the head, then cauterize with the iron that I have described at the beginning of the descent of the water. Make an incision in the middle of the forehead, two incisions on either cheekbone, and two incisions under the bone at the nape of the neck. If more is needed, make additional incisions on each side of the eye's tail at the edge of the eyebrow using a small scalpel.
Chapter Fourteen
On Cauterization for Epistaxis
If the treatment mentioned in the section does not prove effective, then hasten to apply a plaster made of wax for three nights. Then shave his head and cauterize the middle vein on the forehead using an oil-soaked scalpel. Then cauterize with the red-hot iron two incisions above the eyebrows slightly beneath the hair, taking care not to cut the artery. Here is an illustration of the smaltery:
Chapter Fifteen
On Cauterization for Drooping Eyelid
If the eyelid droops due to disease or dampness, cauterize the eyelid with one incision using this crescent-shaped scalpel.
And if you wish, cauterize slightly above the eyebrows on both sides, two incisions each, keeping away from the cheeks. Let the length of each incision be equal to that of the eyebrow.
Do not exaggerate in cauterizing, let it only burn a third of the skin. The shape of the scalpel is like this:
Chapter Sixteenth
In eye cupping
If the eyelids turn inward causing entropion, then there are two kinds of eye cupping. Either by fire cautery or by drug cautery; as for cauterization with fire, the patient should beforehand stop pulling at his eyelashes if he does so that they may grow long and even.
When the lashes grow back and become steady, bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they have grown. When they have grown and become even, place the patient's head on your lap then mark with ink an outline resembling the shape of an almond leaf onto the eyelid.
Begin marking at the base of the lashes, then place beneath the eyelid a pad soaked in egg white or sparrow's saliva. Then heat an iron cautery with this shape.
Then cauterize according to the shape you have marked, a little at a time many times until the skin surface burns like the entire almond leaf shape. A sign of your success is when the eyelid has shrunken and the lashes have risen away from the eyeball.
Then raise your hand and leave him for three days. Then apply a bandage soaked in butter until the lashes fall out, then treat with ointment until it heals God willing. If any hair returns later and the eyelid relaxes again...
...repeat the cauterization as before. If there is hair on the lower eyelid, cauterize until it returns to its natural position and does not turn inward again. As for cautery with burnt drug...
Then make a paper shape resembling an almond leaf. Take equal weights of common soap and un-slaked lime, about one pound each, grind them together quickly without letting it dry. Then spread this mixture onto the paper shape you made, place it on the eyelid or both eyes, and put a pad soaked in egg white under the eye. Place the patient's head on your lap.
Place your index finger above the medication and press it slightly while moving it whenever the patient feels pain due to the sensation of the medicine being like fire. Continue until the sensation subsides, then remove the medication and wash the eye with water.
If you observe that the eyelid has risen as it does when burned by fire or cut, then apply more medication to the unaffected area until your task is complete and the eye is healed. Then place cotton soaked in oil onto it until the burning sensation subsides.
Then treat it with the yellow ointment or other similar remedies until it heals. When performing this procedure, be extremely careful not to let any medication fall into the eye, as if the eyelid relaxes after several days and some hair enters the eye.
So repeat applying the medication to that relaxed eyelid area, especially as you did initially. Then treat it until it heals, and this is the image of the date leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size from one another, so adjust your cautery accordingly. There is no fixed method for those who have experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen
The treatment of styes which appear at the corner of the eye.
If after treating a sty with what has been mentioned in the sections on diseases, it does not improve, then cauterize it as follows:
Order the patient to place their head in your lap and have a servant hold their head firmly between their hands so that it does not move or shake.
Then place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or spittle on the patient's eyes, and heat the cautery, which has this shape:
The cautery should be shaped like a hollow tube resembling the shape of an eagle's feather at one end, which is used for cauterization. If you wish, it can be open at the other end or closed like a reed, although this hollow tube is preferable for your work, if God wills.
Then squeeze the sty if it is open and remove its contents, or if it is not open, cut it open and extract its pus. Then place the heated cautery on it while holding it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
Move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose so that your hand does not err nor disturb the patient, lest the spatula fall upon the eye's membrane and spoil it. If you reach the first sinus of the bone, proceed; otherwise, prepare the spatula again if necessary.
Leave him for three days, then apply a linen cloth soaked in butter and treat him with dried ointment until he recovers. If forty days pass and he has not recovered, apply the sharp medicine that consumes until the bone is exposed, as mentioned later in its chapter, if God wills.
Another method for treating the nasal sinus, as mentioned by some early authors: approach the location of the sinus and make an incision there. Then place a thin funnel into the same cut; this is its appearance.
Pour into it about the weight of a dirham of melted lead and hold the funnel firmly with your hand, ensuring that the patient does not move so that the molten lead does not flow into their eye. It is preferable to place a wet cloth soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye.
For the lead burns the location of the sinus and heals it with a wonderful healing. If the sinus is healed by what we have mentioned about the cure and treatment, otherwise, it is necessary to use nasal cautery and restore the sinus to its proper position in the nose, as will be discussed more specifically later on.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the Treatment of Cleft Lip.
A common occurrence is the cleft lip, known as "the hair," especially in children. If treatment of this cleft by what was mentioned earlier does not prove effective, then prepare a small, thin spatula shaped like this:
Make its hollow like the edge of a blade, then place it heated with embers into the same cleft until the cautery reaches the depth of the cleft. Then treat it with tartar ointment until it heals, if God wills.
Chapter Nineteen
On the Treatment of Nasal Sinus Located in the Mouth
If a swelling appears at the root of the teeth or in the gum or at the roots of the jaws, then it becomes inflamed and bursts open to become a nasal sinus from which pus flows. If treatment proves ineffective, then heat a spatula according to the size that fits into the sinus.
Then, introduce it through the hole of the nose, protecting it with gauze until you reach the depth required. Repeat this once or twice then treat it as mentioned earlier until it heals, if Allah wills.
If the matter is cut off and healed, then no incision is necessary; otherwise, it is mandatory to expose the site and remove the rotting bone as will be described later, if Allah wills.
Chapter Twenty.
On fractures of the jaws and loosened teeth.
If the gums have softened due to moisture and the teeth have become loose, despite treating them with medication without success, then place the head of the clamp in your palm and warm the bellows whose image is shown below by placing the tube on the tooth.
Then insert the bellows protected with tinder, holding your hand for a moment until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth. Then remove your hand and repeat this process as desired. Then the patient should rinse their mouth with saltwater.
He holds it for a moment then releases it; this will stabilize the loose tooth and firm up the relaxed gums, drying out the rotting moisture.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On toothache.
If the toothache is caused by cold or has decay, despite treating it with medication without success, then there are two options for treatment: either cauterization with butter or cauterization with fire.
As for cauterization with butter, you should take some cow's butter and melt it in an iron spoon or seashell. Then take a piece of cloth, dip it into the melted butter, wrap it around the tip of a probe, and apply it to the painful tooth with haste, holding it until it cools down.
Repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. Alternatively, you may dip a wick or cloth in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth while placing the heated iron above it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, you should use a copper or iron tube with some thickness to prevent the heat of the fire from reaching the patient's mouth. Then warm the bellows whose image is shown and place it on the same tooth while holding your hand until the bellows cools down. Repeat this several times.
If pain goes away either on that day or the following, then after that it is necessary to fill the patient's mouth with good clarified butter and hold him for a moment before expelling it. This is an image of the mold.
Mold can be done on whichever side you wish and at whatever size is possible, and this is an image of the funnel.
The Twenty-Second Chapter
Regarding the Molding of the Pig's Snout
If pigs are affected by phlegm and cold dampness, and do not improve with medications, and you want a quick improvement, then use the hollow mold whose image is shown here with both ends open.
To let smoke out at the other end of the mold, place it protectively on the same tumor once or twice if necessary until you reach the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the mold to fit its size.
Then leave it for three days, and apply a cloth dipped in clarified butter until what was burned by the fire goes away. Then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, if God wills.
The Twenty-Third Chapter
Regarding Molding for Hoarseness of Voice and Shortness of Breath
If phlegm has taken hold of the trachea, especially if accompanied by coldness of temperament, it is necessary for the patient to first use laxative medications, then apply a mold to the hollow of the neck at the base of the larynx.
Be careful not to reach the larynx with the mold, and do not burn more than a small amount of skin. Then apply another mold at the junction of the neck with the shoulder, making it conical according to the size mentioned.
Then treat him as mentioned earlier until he recovers, if God wills.
The Twenty-Fourth Chapter
Regarding Molding for Lung Disease and Cough
If cough and lung disease are due to cold phlegm, without fever or chills, and the disease is chronic, apply molds on both hollows of the shoulders at the lowest points, and another mold in the center of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be made of iron, as depicted. If you wish, it can also be made with the pointed cautery called 'the Dot', whose image has been shown in the treatment of earache. The dots should number approximately thirty.
Then treat it as mentioned earlier until it heals. You can also make a cautery with three prongs, as shown in the image; this will expedite the procedure as you can cauterize three vessels at once. This is an image of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Fifth
In cauterizing the buttocks.
If the head of the shoulder joint becomes dislocated due to slippery fluids or does not remain in place and has been repeatedly replaced until it has become a habit, then it should not be reduced again initially. Then the patient lies on their back or the affected side. Then lift the skin inside the buttocks upwards with fingers from your left hand if the joint has dislocated inwards.
Then heat the cautery with two prongs, as shown in this image.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side, making four incisions. Alternatively, you can use a cautery with three prongs, resulting in six incisions, with the prongs resting on the soft flesh.
This is an image of the cautery with three prongs.
Adding one more incision will result in eight incisions. Then apply the ground crusts with salt to the cautery. Keep the patient at rest and do not move the limb until it has healed. Dislocation upwards rarely occurs.
Cauterize above the shoulder joint once with a large iron cautery or perform multiple punctures to reduce the joint and eliminate moisture, leading to recovery.
Chapter Twenty-Sixth
On cauterizing the stomach
If there is coldness and excessive moisture in the stomach causing vomiting, frequent indigestion despite various treatments proving ineffective, then lie the patient on their back with legs and arms extended. Then cauterize three times. A triangle-shaped design is made under the breastbone with a lancet, and two below the knees. Each incision should be like this until the incisions resemble a triangle shape, keeping them apart so they do not merge upon healing. The depth of the incision should be about one-third the thickness of the skin.
As shown in this image and to this extent, no more.
If you wish, make a single large incision in the middle of the abdomen as shown in this image.
And the lancet used for this single incision should be circular-shaped as shown in this image.
Instead, the abdomen can be marked with dots for those who are hesitant about this incision. Using a pen, mark points on the abdomen to the desired depth, then use a puncturing lancet to make the incisions, and treat them according to the method mentioned until they heal.
Chapter Twenty-Seventh.
In cold liver incision.
If the patient suffers from pain in the liver due to coldness and dampness or wind excess, such that it exceeds its normal state, despite treatment with what has been mentioned previously without success. It is necessary for the patient to lie on their back and mark three incisions of this shape and size on the liver below the ribs where the human elbow ends.
And after each incision, make another incision equal to the thickness of a finger, with the incision running straight along the body without pressing too hard with the lancet.
And burn only half the thickness of the skin, no more. The patient should stand on their feet; if they cannot stand, then lie down with legs extended and arms raised. This is an image of the cautery.
And you may use the cautery lancet to burn these incisions if you are skilled and careful, being cautious not to burn too deeply as the skin there is thin, so as not to reach the intestines.
Chapter Twenty-Eighth.
In treating an enlarged liver by incision.
If a swelling appears on the liver and you wish to determine whether it is in the flesh of the liver or its capsule, if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient will feel heavy and painful without definite limits.
If there is inflammation in the liver, causing severe pain, which has baffled physicians regarding its treatment, then have the patient lie on their back and apply a poultice at the warm spot with ink.
Then heat the iron in the fire, this being the one that resembles the letter 'mim', which is its shape. And apply it once, until all the skin is burned and the heat reaches the liver, allowing all the matter to come out. Then treat as you would a boil until it heals.
And this method of cautery should only be employed by one who has extensive training in the art of medicine and has practiced it many times, for I would prefer to leave such work to him.
Chapter Twenty-Nine
On Cauterizing a Hemorrhoid.
The ancients described cauterizing a prolapsed hemorrhoid using the roots of asafoetida thus: Take one long, dry root of asafoetida, as thick as a finger, dip it in oil, and heat it in fire. Then apply it once between the neck and the collarbone, two small cauteries near the ears slightly leaning towards the beard area, and two large cauteries above the chest between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more between the fifth and sixth ribs, inclined slightly towards the back, one in the middle of the chest, another above the stomach, three behind one another between the shoulders, and two on either side of the rib cage below the elbow cautery.
It is not necessary to press deeply with the cautery, but rather to use it lightly on the surface of the skin. Some authorities mention that some people use an iron cautery resembling the letter 'mim', heating it and inserting it between the buttocks until it reaches the actual prolapse.
And the matter will come out as mentioned in the case of liver prolapse. In this case, cauterizing the anus with a hot iron can either kill the patient immediately or leave them with sores that will not heal.
Chapter Thirty
Of the spleen.
If you have treated the spleen with what has been mentioned in the division of medicine, and your treatment did not prove effective, then cauterize it at three points, all of which are accurate: either three or four evenly spaced ones along the length of the spleen.
Shape them like the liver cauterizations that have been shown, with each cauterization being about the thickness of a finger or slightly more. The shape of the cautery should be as described for liver cauterization, without pressing too deeply. The patient should lie on their back during this procedure.
The second method is at the elbow joint. Raise the skin that faces the spleen where the patient's right elbow ends, and also raise the skin that faces the spleen where the left elbow ends. The raising of the skin should be across the width of the body so that the cauterizations are along the length of the body.
Then insert both needles carefully until they penetrate the skin on the other side. Remove the cautery, resulting in four cauterizations. If you wish, you can also use the three-pronged cautery.
Then treat the site of cauterization after allowing it to discharge pus for many days, as this is the most effective treatment among those mentioned before.
Chapter Thirty-One
Of Trepanation
Trepanation is beneficial only in cases of acute hydrocephalus, especially if other treatments mentioned in the division have not proven effective. In such case, cauterize four points around the scar and one point on the abdomen.
And another cauterization on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the back between the shoulder blades, one near the chest and the other near the abdomen. The depth of the cauterizations should be close to the thickness of the skin. Then leave the wound open to discharge pus for a long time.
The patient should not be deprived of other treatments after cauterization, as combining them will hasten recovery. The shape of the cautery used for the back should be pointed, as previously described, and the one used for the abdomen should be spoon-shaped.
The Second and Thirtieth Chapter
In the Treatment of Feet and Legs
If swelling appears in the foot and it fills with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot at the furrow between the little toe and the ring toe.
And hold your hand steady with the cauterizer, do not move it, then raise your hand without returning it, for water will flow out and the cauterizer should be of this shape.
Then cauterize the legs twice on each leg, with the knife-edge of the cauterizer. One cauterization should be below the knee and the other above it towards the middle of the thigh. On each buttock, cauterize twice.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time until water flows out from it, then treat it with what has been mentioned.
The Thirty-third Chapter
In the Treatment of Diarrhea
If diarrhea is due to cold and humidity, causing weakness of the digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, despite various treatments, and you see that the patient is suitable for cauterization with great strength, then cauterize them once on the abdomen. As mentioned earlier in cauterization of the stomach with a ring cauterizer, and four cauterizations around the navel with a gently heated, round cauterizer. Also, one cauterization on the pubic hair or two if necessary.
If you find that humidity is abundant and the patient is suitable for it, cauterize once on the pubic hair, once on each rib cage, and perhaps add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large intestine. This treatment will be successful without fail, if Allah wills.
The Thirty-fourth Chapter
In the Treatment of Hemorrhoids
If there are chronic, numerous or single hemorrhoids in the anus, caused by coarse, cold impurities or corrupt humors, and they have been treated with what was mentioned earlier without success, then cauterize the patient three times on the lower back near the spine, about a finger's breadth below the waist.
Place two fingers beneath the breast, assuming his stomach has cooled and his food is undigested. Observe his face which appears pale, therefore apply a cupping glass to his stomach as mentioned earlier, and another on his chest. And place an iron branding tool on his hip and leave the cupping glass open for a time, then treat him until he recovers, if Allah wills.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On Treating Warts.
After cutting it off, if the mole is cut, heat the cauterizing iron resembling a nail and insert its tip into the same wound of the removed mole. Press your hand firmly until the iron reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood flows. Perform this once or twice.
If there are many warts, cauterize each one as described earlier, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal. If the cautery is performed on cotton, it will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Six
On Treating Hemorrhoids That Appear in the Anus and Its Surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to diet and the treatment described earlier, then perhaps cautery may help. If one suffers from prolapsed hemorrhoids with pus and foul discharge issuing forth, first measure it using a fine probe.
Then determine its size using the probe, heat the cauterizing iron resembling a nail, and insert its tip into the same hemorrhoid vertically according to its depth and the measure of the probe. Perform cautery until all corrupt tissues are burned once, twice, or thrice depending on your need.
And be cautious not to burn the nerve if there is one, nor the great vein if there is one. If the hemorrhoids reach the bladder or the rectum.
Avoid these areas altogether. Perform this procedure only if the hemorrhoids are in a fleshy spot and you estimate that they are not prolapsed. Treat the area until it heals. If the wound closes, the materials stop flowing, and this state persists for some time, then know that it is completely healed.
If the discharge does not cease, know that it is either issuing from a fractured bone or a large diseased cavity, or something similar which will be mentioned in its proper place.
Chapter Seven and Thirty.
In the matter of the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or strong wind, and sexual activity is thereby diminished, then cauterize on both sides of the same kidney using the triangular cautery iron mentioned earlier; perhaps a third one may be added on the same plate, making three triangles arranged symmetrically, which would increase its effectiveness.
Chapter Eighty-Three
In the matter of the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and dampness such that the patient cannot retain urine, cauterize on the lower part of the scrotum over the bladder where pubic hair begins, and also cauterize once on the right side of the scrotum and once on the left side.
And after cauterizing each side, cauterize to the extent of the thumb joint, and cauterize once on the lower back or twice if necessary; use the triangular cautery iron mentioned earlier.
Chapter Ninety-Three
In the matter of cauterizing the uterus.
If cold and dampness cause material to flow from the uterus, preventing conception and impairing fertility or causing pain upon intercourse, then cauterize three times around the scrotum as mentioned earlier in the case of bladder cautery. And cauterize once on cotton placed on the lower back or twice; use the triangular cautery iron.
Chapter Forty
In cauterizing dislocation of the hip joint.
If wrongful dampness enters the hip joint causing dislocation, and the leg appears longer than the other when compared side by side with a gap felt at the point of dislocation, then cauterize on the hip joint itself using a semicircular cautery iron.
After drawing a semicircle around the joint with ink, cauterize using the cautery iron depicted earlier for cauterizing the stomach; if this iron is not available, use three large circular cautery irons.
It is recommended to incise deeply according to the thickness of all the skin, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-One.
In treating hemorrhoids.
If pain occurs in the buttock region due to coldness and dampness, as mentioned earlier in this section, but the treatment has not been effective after some time, it is advisable for the physician to thin out the thick humors using rhubarb or tragacanth gum.
Then, cauterize and direct the cut towards the buttock in two ways: either cauterize with burning drugs or cauterize with fire. Cauterizing with fire can be done in many ways; one of them is to perform three similar cauteries on the actual buttock.
And make it deep enough, with about the thickness of a finger between each cautery. Use a copper cauterizing instrument. You may also perform one cautery in the center at the very top of the buttock, making four in total. If desired, you can use the circular cautery mentioned earlier for dislocated buttocks to perform one cautery.
This is the description of cauterizing for hemorrhoids if the pain is persistent in the buttock itself without extending to the thigh or leg.
But if the pain extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize twice on the thigh at the location indicated by the patient's complaint of pain, and once above the anus about four fingers to the right side using a sharp cautery. The depth of the cut should be according to the thickness of the skin only.
If the pain extends towards the toes of the foot, cauterize there three or four times with a pointed cautery as needed. If the pain is indicated beneath the knee towards the leg, cauterize there once with a sharp cautery.
And be careful in all your cauteries to avoid reaching the sciatic nerve or a major artery, as this would cause great harm or disability to the patient.
I have seen two people who cauterized above the anus too deeply, causing the leg to swell up to the foot and become gangrenous. The entire limb was ruined, and afterwards diarrhea and death occurred. If the pain is on both sides, cauterize them according to this same method.
It has been mentioned by some wise scholars that this type of hip dislocation resembles a cup made of iron, with its diameter being half a cubit and at its mouth it is slightly thicker than the stone of a date or a little less. Within this cup there are two smaller cups.
And between each pair of cups it is the width of a thumb joint, with both cups being open on either side and their height being approximately one or two finger joints. They have iron handles that are securely attached to the cups.
Then they are heated in fire until red-hot and the sparks are removed. They are then placed on the hip joint, with the patient lying on their healthy side, and three circular movements are made at once. This process is left for three days, after which the wound is smeared with butter and kept open.
Thereafter, treat it with ointment until it heals. The author of this book says that this type of dislocation is rarely used due to its severity and the unpleasant sight it presents, and because few people can endure it except those who have strong endurance and are willing to bear it.
As for dislocation caused by burning drugs, two cups resembling doors' bolts made of copper or iron should be prepared.
Their height should be about one and a half finger joints, with the width between them being as thick as a finger. Both ends should be open, and they should be fixed together in this manner.
Then place them on the hip joint while the patient lies on their healthy side, with your hand wrapped in cotton. Pour hot water between the two cups using a funnel and hold it for about an hour, until the patient endures the pain and heat.
Until the pain subsides, then remove your hand with the tool and wipe off all the hot water from the hip joint using cold water. Leave it for three days, applying butter to it until the blackness of the burn fades away. Leave it open for as long as pus keeps coming out.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a similar device for them as you did for the hip joint using hot water. This is the description of the hot water mixture which has been proven effective in treating ailments.
Take from saltpeter and from unslaked lime one part each, grind them together, and place them in a new vessel pierced at the bottom with a small hole sufficient to admit the wick. Place underneath the vessel another vessel perforated in like manner.
Pour on the saltpeter and lime some fresh water to cover them by a finger's breadth, then press them with your hand using a good press. Leave the vessel until the harsh water has drained into the lower perforated vessel, then collect all this water and pour it on two more portions of saltpeter and lime likewise prepared.
Then it becomes very caustic and can be used in many medical operations and cauterizations of various organs, as it acts like fire itself. Among the remedies with which one may cauterize a joint are Thapsia, bdellium resin, and lime mixed with soap, all ground finely.
Galenos relates a story about an elderly man who used this remedy to treat pain in the hip joint and sciatica, finding it extremely effective and claiming that no further treatment was needed as it cured him at once.
So much so that he might have entered the bathhouse carried and come out cured, using green frankincense; if this is not available, fresh dry frankincense may be used instead. Grind it with a little fat and apply it to the hip joint or thigh where the pain is felt.
Let it remain for three hours or until the patient feels that the burning sensation has subsided, then take him to the bathhouse. When his body is dry, immerse him in a warm bath. If the pain goes away and he is cured, with God's permission, if not, repeat the application after ten days.
Insha'Allah, he will be cured. Know that one should not apply cautery with these drugs unless the body has been purged beforehand. Diskarides mentions that burnt goat hair can also be used to cauterize sciatica.
The cauterization process is as follows: Take some wool, soak it in old oil and apply it to the deep hollow between the thumb and the wrist bone, closer to the wrist. Then take dry goat hair.
Kindle it with fire until it becomes a ember, then place it on wool and let it cool until it extinguishes. Then take another one; continue doing this until the pain subsides from the elbow to the hip by the permission of Allah. This type of cupping is called 'Al-Ba'ri'.
Chapter Forty-two
In treating back pain.
Back pain may have many causes, such as falls, blows, or excessive coughing and the like. In this type of cupping, it is only performed when there is a buildup of cold wet matter.
After the patient has coughed up phlegm, they should be cupped on their back where the pain is. There should be three rows of cups across the width of the table, with five or more cups in each row depending on the patient's tolerance and strength.
The cupping should be done using a cupping horn, using three or four cups for best results. A medium-sized brass cup can also be used, shaped like this:
Chapter Forty-three
In cupping the initial rise of the buttocks
This condition often affects young children. The first sign in a child is difficulty breathing during movement and activity, and you will find that the last few vertebrae of their spine have protruded like a bead, standing out from the others.
If you see this and wish to stop it, cup with a circular cup shaped like this: Take the cupping on both sides of the vertebra evenly. You may also cup around the vertebra with a cupping horn in two or three rows, keeping the cups close together. Then treat the area until it heals according to what has been mentioned.
Be careful not to use cupping on buttocks that are swollen due to nerve compression,
Chapter Forty-four
In cupping gout and joint pains
If joint pains are caused by cold dampness that has settled in any part of the body, and if these pains occur in the legs, physicians usually call this condition "gout.
If, after treating gout with the various remedies mentioned in this book, the pain persists, then cauterization is to be applied. After evacuation of waste matter around the ankles, many applications are made using a medium-sized bronze cautery instrument.
And if it becomes necessary to cauterize the face of the foot, use a pointed cautery instrument. If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, cauterize each knee three or four times on each side using the same bronze cautery instrument.
If more cauterizations are required, apply them without pressing the cautery deeply into the skin; it should be done merely to thicken the skin. If the pain ascends to the buttocks or back, use the cautery method mentioned earlier for these areas.
If the pain is only in the hands, cauterize around the wrists in two rows. If the pain persists in the fingers, cauterize at each joint and on the palm of the hand. If the pain ascends after some days to the elbows or shoulders.
So cauterize both sides without neglecting good care and medication. For if one improves their diet and evacuates phlegm, recovery will ensue with this cautery, God willing.
Chapter Fifty-Four
On the Cautery of Hemorrhoids
If hemorrhoids appear in the anus with some intestines and veins protruding to the scrotum, especially if it is a recent onset, do not advise the patient to abstain from food that day. Instead, prescribe gentle laxatives to help expel the hardened feces from his bowels.
Then have the patient lie on his back before you and instruct him to hold himself up until the protruding veins or intestines appear. Then push them back with your finger, and mark beneath the hemorrhoid on the pubic bone using ink, making a semicircular sign with its ends pointing upwards towards the abdomen.
Then heat this cautery instrument to redness.
Until it becomes white-hot and sparks fly off. Then push the intestines or veins back into their place. Have an attendant press his hand on the area to prevent the intestines from protruding again, and place a pillow between the patient's legs. Another attendant should hold down the patient's thighs.
He places his hand on the patient's chest, holding both hands down. Then he lowers the iron onto the same mark, pressing it upright with his hand until he reaches the bone or repeats this step if not reached on the first attempt.
And exert caution to prevent the intestines from protruding while heating, lest they be burned and thus cause either death or severe injury to the patient. Know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work has failed. It is recommended that the irons used for children have a suitable size for their constitution, and likewise for adults.
Then treat the cauterized area three days later with oil to remove any blackened skin, then apply other ointments until it heals. Let the patient lie on their back for forty days until the wound scars.
It is necessary to make the patient's diet mild during their treatment period to prevent the intestines from protruding during evacuation and urination. Then, after forty days of bedrest, use a binder to hold the abdomen for another forty days to reduce excessive fatigue, fullness from food and drink, and severe coughing.
However, if this procedure is followed correctly, God willing, it will result in a complete recovery. I will discuss the treatment of hernias by incision in its appropriate section, God willing. As for hernias that occur elsewhere on the abdomen and are beginning to develop, you can prevent them from increasing by applying a circular cautery mark corresponding to their size. And let the burnt skin be like a third of an inch in width. Then treat it as mentioned earlier, God willing, for this will not cause further enlargement. Some earlier authors have mentioned cauterizing hernias with a triangular iron.
After marking the hernia with ink, draw a line horizontally across the top of the hernia and another line vertically downwards. Then insert your hand into the middle using one cautery iron; the first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On Cauterization of Hemorrhoids.
If pain occurs in any organ due to a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time without relief from medication, then cauterization should be performed at the point of injury. The size of the cautery iron used should be appropriate for the size, strength, and weakness of the affected organ.
Should pain and inflammation occur, treat with cupping. If it does not improve after the first cupping session, repeat as necessary because these pains often spread to nearby areas. Therefore, continue cupping until recovery is achieved.
Chapter Forty-Seven
In treating leprosy with cupping.
As for those afflicted with leprosy, they greatly benefit from cupping, especially the type that results from corruption of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cup them, then if the leprosy is in its early stages and has been treated with what was mentioned earlier without improvement or halt, and you fear that corruption may spread throughout his entire constitution, perform five cuppings on his head. One in the middle of the skull, another below it near the forehead at the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one from behind on the nape of the neck. Insist on cupping until there is a slight effect on the bone.
And remove its scales so that coarse fumes can be expelled from it. Also cup the spleen in the same manner as mentioned earlier. But if the leprosy has persisted and is clearly visible, do not perform these cuppings on the head. Cup at the tip of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the jawbones, seven on the spine, one large cup on the coccyx at the end of the tailbone, another above it on the same level, and two on the kidneys, one on each hip. Two on each knee, two on the elbows, two on the shoulders, two on the armpits, two on the breasts, and one on each knuckle of his hands and feet. Cup both heels and the palms of his hands.
Avoid the nerve located at the back of the heels to prevent burning them. Cup also on the pubic bone, another on the stomach, and another on the liver. Know that the more you cup, the better and more beneficial it will be.
Know that the patient does not feel pain from cupping as a healthy person would, because his body has become numb. The cups should be of varying sizes according to the size of the limbs and joints, as mentioned earlier in the description of cup shapes.
Then he treated the wound with crushed nard mixed with honey and other medications until it healed, if God wills.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
In cases of numbness of a limb, when a member has been numbed and treated with medications, ointments, and dressings but does not heal, then cut off the dead member according to its size and the importance of the bone, making sure to cut through the thickness of the skin slightly.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals, for some numbness that affects the hand or leg can be relieved by cauterizing the vertebrae at the point where the nerve that moves that member exits.
And let no one attempt this except someone knowledgeable in anatomy and the exits of the moving nerves of the body.
Chapter Forty-Nine.
On the treatment of leprosy.
If leprosy has advanced and no medical remedy has been effective, then cut into it to a depth proportionate to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with ground lentils mixed with rose oil, buckthorn leaf resin, and pigeon or duck blood, each one part combined together and applied to a cloth and left on the spot until it heals.
Chapter Fifty
On the treatment of cancer.
If the cancer is still in its early stages and you want to stop it, cauterize around it using a circular cautery like a ring. Some sages have mentioned that a deep cut should be made in its center, but I do not agree with this as I expect it to ulcerate, which I have seen happen many times.
Therefore, the best method is to cauterize around it using a circular cautery or numerous small cuts.
Chapter Fifty-One
On the treatment of scabies.
If scabies appears on someone and its development is slow, either due to the effectiveness of the remedy used or because the patient is an elderly person with low blood flow, or due to the time it has taken, then to hasten the development of the scabies, make numerous small cuts around it like drops.
Then leave it alone for it hastens ripening. If you wish to cauterize the abscess with a hot iron, heat the one that resembles this shape.
And place it in the middle of the swelling until it penetrates the skin, ensuring that the cauterization is below the level of the swelling to facilitate the discharge of pus. Then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Two
On Cauterizing Ulcers.
Ulcers are corruption that spreads in the flesh, consuming it like fire consumes dry wood. If you find an ulcer in a location suitable for cauterization with fire, prepare many small and large iron instruments according to what is appropriate for that spot where the ulcer is located.
Then cauterize it from all sides until the corruption is completely destroyed and none remains. Leave it for three days, then apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized spots so that all scales are removed and all corruption disappears.
Then treat it with ointment that promotes flesh growth. If after three days you find that the flesh grows healthy without corruption, then leave it alone; otherwise, repeat the cauterization on any remaining corrupted spots and treat the ulcer with a caustic drug.
For it acts as a substitute for fire, bringing quicker relief. The treatment of ulcers with strong drugs is mentioned in the division on medications; take it from there whenever you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three
On Cauterizing Both Upright and Reversed Pimples.
This condition often occurs at the bottoms of feet, causing roughness that troubles people. Cauterization can be done in two ways: either by fire or by strong water.
As for cauterization by fire, heat the spoon-shaped iron instrument resembling a chicken's comb, made to fit around the pimple on all sides and with a thin edge. Then place it heated over the pimple and rotate your hand around it until the instrument reaches the depth of the pimple.
Leave it for three days until pus begins to discharge, then apply a compress of fresh breadcrumbs mixed with salt and leave it overnight. This will cause the pimple to fall off at its base, then treat the wound with flesh-growing ointment until it heals. If the pimples are not reversed, proceed as follows:
Often, eruptions occur on the surface of the body, particularly in the hands and feet. It is advisable to take a tube of copper or iron or eagle feathers and insert it onto the pimple or mole, then pour into the tube a small amount of acid water.
And hold your hand while rotating it slightly by pinching your thumb so that the edge of the tube affects the root of the pimple, and the acid water may reach its source. The patient should endure for a moment the sting of the acid water.
Then leave it, for the pimple will be removed at its roots. Do this one by one until all of them are removed from the body, then treat the areas with ointments that promote flesh growth.
Chapter Forty-Five
In case of dislocated jaw.
If a person suffers from numbness in the jaw due to cold or feverish chill or other causes, it is advisable to warm him four or five times on the spine between each vertebra and once on his chest. And also heat his stomach with an oiled iron, for the dislocation will subside and the cold illness will quickly recover.
Chapter Fifty-Five
In case of boils occurring on the body.
When boils appear on the body due to cold, hard, corrupted materials, it is advisable at their first appearance to cauterize each boil gently with a hot wooden stick or long pepper root or an iron cautery.
And also cauterize the miliary boils at their onset in this manner, for it prevents their spread and eliminates their harmful effect. However, this should be done after the patient has purged himself with a bloodletting.
Chapter Sixty-Five
In case of bleeding occurring during vein cutting.
It often happens that blood flows from an artery that has been cut while attempting to sever it externally, or when incising a tumor or operating on an organ, making its ligation difficult.
If this happens, quickly place your index finger on the mouth of the artery to stop the bleeding. Then take several iron cauteries of various sizes and heat them until they become very hot.
Then take one [vein], either small or large depending on the wound and where the artery burst, and place the clamp over the same vein after removing your finger with the forceps and holding it until the bleeding stops.
If blood flows when you lift your finger from the mouth of the artery and extinguish the clamp, then take another heated clamp from those prepared in the fire and continue doing so one after another until bleeding stops.
And be careful not to burn the vein, and if you cause harm in one place, treat another nearby part of the patient. Know that if blood flows from an artery it cannot be cut, especially if it is large, except by cauterizing it with a hot iron or cutting its branch if it has not been severed. If you cut the branch, its ends will contract and bleeding will stop. Otherwise, tie it with a tight suture or use medications that can stop bleeding and apply pressure using bandages.
But if someone tries to cut it with a bandage or by tying or using burning materials etc., bleeding will not stop except rarely. If one of these methods fails and no doctor or medicine is available, then place the index finger on the mouth of the wound as described earlier.
Hold it tightly until bleeding is confined and flows over the wound and your finger. Do not remove your finger even with cold water, for the blood will harden and coagulate. During this time, observe what cauterization or medication is needed.
Chapter Two
On Fractures, Abdominal Emergencies, Hemoptysis, and Other Surgeries
Al-Khalifi mentioned in the first book all diseases suitable for cauterization with fire and the burned medication, their causes, symptoms, instruments, and forms of clamps. I have arranged these topics from head to foot in chapters.
And I will follow this method in this chapter to facilitate learning for the student
Before beginning, know that this chapter on cauterization is more difficult than what was in the first book.
Therefore, caution in this chapter should be more stringent because the work therein is extensive. Blood loss often occurs, upon which life depends, when opening a vein or cutting into an abscess, tumor, or inflammation, or performing surgery, removing an arrowhead, or cutting for a stone and other similar procedures, all of which involve risk and fear, and many of them result in death.
I warn you against falling into doubt in this profession, for many people come to you with various ailments. Some have become weary of their illness and desire death.
Because of the greatness of his pain and the length of his suffering, the desperation that indicates death is apparent in him. Some of them offer you wealth, hoping for health while their disease is fatal; do not accept anything from such people.
And let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness. Do not proceed with anything of this kind except after certain knowledge that the desired outcome will result, and use foresight in all treatment of your patients, accompanied by warning of what safety entails.
For in this there is help for you to gain praise and glory and remembrance, O son of Adam! May God inspire you with His guidance, and not forbid you from the right path and good fortune, for that is in His hand. None has the right to be worshipped but He.
I have arranged this chapter with sections following what I have mentioned in the book on bones and feet, so that you may find easily whatever you desire, if God wills.
Chapter One.
On treating water that collects in children's heads.
This ailment often occurs in newborn babies when the midwife roughly presses the child's head during birth, or it may occur from an unknown hidden cause.
I have not seen this ailment in anyone but children, and all whom I have seen died quickly because of it. Therefore, I consider leaving it untreated. Indeed, I saw a child whose head was filled with water, and the head swelled daily. Until the child could no longer bear to sit up due to the size of his head and the increase in moisture, until he died.
This moisture is either gathered between the skin and bone or beneath the bone on the peritoneum. If it is between the skin and bone, and the swelling is small, then one should make a single transverse incision in the middle of the forehead about two spans long to allow the moisture to flow out.
If the moisture is more abundant and the swelling greater, then make two intersecting incisions like this:
If the moisture is beneath the bone, indicated by the hairline appearing open on all sides and water flowing inward when pressed with the hand, then make three incisions in the middle of the forehead like this:
After making the incisions, all the moisture will flow out. Then close the incisions with bandages and dressings, and apply oil and wine from above for five days. After that, release the bindings, dress the wound with flaxseed meal and ointments, and do not bind the head too tightly. Feed the patient dry food with little moisture.
Until the part heals, another method of incision is to look where the bone of the swelling appears and where the water collects, for it may be more abundant at the back or front, right or left.
So make the incision where you see the swelling and water accumulation, as much as possible without cutting any vein, for fear of bleeding causing death along with the release of moisture.
Chapter Two.
How to ligate the two arteries behind the ears known as the 'hawsis.'
This procedure is performed when a patient suddenly develops symptoms of severe eye pain or chest discomfort, despite previous medicinal treatments that proved ineffective.
First, shave the patient's head with a razor. Then, wipe the area with a rough cloth to make the arteries visible. Next, have the patient hold their breath while lying down. Locate where the pulse is strongest behind the ears, as the arteries are usually found there.
Mark the location of the arteries with ink. Then, using a sharp lancet, cut each artery perpendicular to the skull, cutting completely through. Alternatively, you may insert the lancet beneath the artery and cut upwards towards the top.
If the vein is severed, blood will flow pulsatingly, continually flowing towards the front of the ear. If the artery is not palpable, one should estimate about three fingers' breadth behind the ear and then incise using a probe until bone is reached.
Send from the blood seven bowls successively to the center. Perhaps more or less may be sent according to the strength of the patient and the fullness of his arteries. Then examine the wound, if any part of the peritoneum remains on the bone, cut it off.
Lest a hot tumor appear, then suture the wound with a piece of linen thread and dress it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the Arteries Located in the Ear
If a person suffers from chronic headache or sudden sharp pains from hot and moist humors in the muscles of the ear, or severe continuous headache, and is treated with various medical remedies without success, we have tried in these diseases to ligate the arteries of the ear or cut them as described.
The procedure for ligating is to shave the hair from the ear of the patient and locate the visible artery in the temple, as its pulse can be felt easily by most people.
If the artery is not palpable due to extreme cold, the patient should tie his collar tightly with his garment, then wipe or moisten the area with a hot cloth until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the probe which looks like this. Then gently incise the skin with it until you reach the artery. Then insert a hook and pull it upwards until it emerges from the skin, freeing it from any surrounding fasciae on all sides. If the artery is thin, twirl it gently with the hook. Then cut off a portion of it according to how far apart its ends are and how much it contracts without causing bleeding. For if it is not completely severed, blood will not flow at all. Then collect the blood from six bowls up to three.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong double thread, the thread being either of brass or sinew, so that putrefaction does not reach it before the wound has healed and thus cause bleeding.
Then cut off the excess between the ligatures, which can be done at that moment or later; if you wish, you may cauterize it with a scalpel until it reaches the bone to sever its ends, which serves the same purpose or better as mentioned earlier.
However, if the patient has a fever or an irritable temper, cauterization is not recommended as it aids in dissipating bodily fluids. After tying off the arteries, the wound should be filled with clean cotton and dressed properly; afterwards, dry medicines that promote flesh growth and healing ointments should be applied until recovery, insha'Allah.
If bleeding occurs from the artery during your operation, immediately proceed to cut it either by cauterization or filling the wound with a sponge and pressing your hand until the bleeding stops; if nothing helps, insert your finger into the wound to stop the flow of blood.
Then rinse the wound with very cold water to alleviate its intensity and bandage it as necessary. It is easier and simpler to cauterize the veins than to tie off the arteries; therefore, you may use a double-edged scalpel to cauterize them after marking their locations with ink.
Press it firmly until it reaches the bone and severs the vein in two places, so that its ends are separated; this cauterization will not adhere to it at all. This is an illustration of the cautery.
The sharpness of the scalpel-like points should resemble two small horns, but not as sharp as a blade, for if they are too sharp, cold will reach them quickly and not cauterize the flesh properly. Therefore, maintain some bluntness in their edges to retain heat.
If the flesh is cut swiftly, this method is preferable and easier than all others. After cauterization with the scalpel-like points, maintain the thickness of a finger between them.
Chapter Four
In the treatment of persistent hot tears flowing into the eyes
If the tears are continuous, and their flow is from veins on the skull's surface with no benefit from medical treatment using drugs, and you observe that the patient's face has turned pale Then he feels a tickling on his forehead like that of ants, and his eyes are drooping and wet with tears that have eaten away their edges and swollen their eyelids from the intensity of the tears; thus, the first line of treatment resort to this operation, which they call "the surgical cure," that is, ordering the patient to shave the hair on his forehead
Then, incise three parallel cuts on the forehead's length, each cut about two fingers wide; the first in the middle of the forehead parallel to the length of the nose, the second slightly away from the temple muscle, and the third on the other side.
Be careful not to cut the arteries on both sides and keep your hand away from the cheekbones. Leave about three folded fingers between each cut, and have plenty of sponges or dry cloths ready to absorb blood.
Then insert a sharp-pointed forceps with this shape from the cut near the temple to the middle cut, and scrape off all the skin and fascia between them from the bone using this forceps, then do the same from the middle cut to the third cut, and finally remove this forceps. Then insert another instrument called a "scalpel" through the first incision; it is sharp on one side and blunt on the other. Here is its shape:
Make its sharp side face upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone; push it until it reaches the middle cut, and use it to cut all vessels descending from the head to the eyes without cutting through the skin's surface.
Then do the same in the middle cut to the other cut. After bleeding stops moderately, press the cuts with gauze soaked in olive oil or rosewater and oil mixture
To prevent inflammation, remove the bandage on the third day and use plenty of warm water for irrigation. Then treat it with an ointment made of basilicon mixed with rose oil and other ointments used for wounds until it heals, if God wills.
The Fifth Chapter.
For treating eye pain and discharge from the inner part of the head.
If anyone suffers from frequent, severe, burning, persistent eye discharge, causing both eyes to become bloodshot and inflamed with weakened vision, the eyelids reddened and scales falling off them. And if there is also sharp pain within the head and continuous sneezing, know that these symptoms indicate deep-seated vein inflammation. The best treatment for this condition is to order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.
And if there is also sharp pain within the head and continuous sneezing, know that these symptoms indicate deep-seated vein inflammation. The best treatment for this condition is to order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead. Or, raise it slightly across and start the incision from the left cheekbone to the right cheekbone, going as far as the bone. Keep your hand away from the moving temple muscles during chewing until the bone is exposed and all the blood is wiped off with a sponge.
Separate the edges of the incision with linen wicks or cotton yarn, then suture from above using ligatures. Soak the ligatures in a mixture of wine and oil to prevent inflammation. When you remove them and see that inflammation has subsided, do not rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with the dry dressing that promotes flesh growth, such as a plaster made of two parts fine wheat flour and four parts chalk. Prepare an ointment from this mixture and use it to promote flesh growth in wounds like these.
The Sixth Chapter.
For treating what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear belongs to one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, like iron or glass; or a plant-like substance, such as chickpeas or kernels; or a liquid thing, like water or vinegar.
Or an animal, like an earwig or other creature that does not normally reside in the ear. If such a thing falls into the ear, expose it to sunlight through the ear. If you see only the stone, apply some oil of vitriol or sesame seed oil to it, then try to remove it by shaking your head or sneezing with condiment powder. To stop the nostrils during sneezing, after placing a band of linen or wool around the ear and stretching it upwards towards the cheekbone, often this remedy is sufficient. If not, try removal with a gentle hook whose shape is as follows.
However, if it does not come out with the hook even gently, then try removing it with a soft, little bent speculum. If this also fails to remove it, then make a tube of copper and introduce its end into the ear canal gently.
And seal around the tube with soft wax to prevent air from escaping except through the tube, then pull it out strongly with hooks. Often this will be sufficient. If not, take some Nabatean bdellium or prepared bdellium used for birds, a small amount, and place it at the end of the tube.
After wrapping it in a tight cloth, then gently insert it into the ear canal after drying the ear from moisture. If none of these methods succeed, hurry to make an incision before inflammation or spasm occurs.
The recipe for the incision: first, let the patient bleed into a vessel until he loses as much blood as he can tolerate. Then seat the patient in front of you, turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear at its lowest point.
The incision should be crescent-shaped until it reaches the earbone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can. Immediately suture the incision and treat it until it heals.
If the object in the ear is one of the swellings that grow and inflate, try to remove it with what has been mentioned. If this does not succeed, take a thin, gentle probe of this shape:
And try to cut that type of ear polyp with this probe, but do so only if you are certain that the polyp is moistened by the ear's vapor such that it becomes many small pieces. Then remove them with a speculum or hook or tweezers.
As mentioned before, it is easy to remove them. As for water that has entered the ear, do not let the patient sneeze initially while his ear is filled with cotton wool and he is lying on that side containing the water. If this method does not succeed:
Then you take many smooth, round stones along the length of the fingers and heat them gently over a fire. You insert one into the patient's ear while he stands on one leg on that side, then strikes it with another stone.
Continue doing this with each stone until all the water comes out. Water can also be removed by taking a feather, inserting one end into the ear and then heating the other end over fire until it chars.
Do this repeatedly until all the water comes out or is sucked out with the tube mentioned earlier regarding stones. As for removing creatures that have entered, look: if they are small like lice, treat them as described in the section on insects.
If its body is large and visible to the touch, try to remove it using tweezers and tongs; this is easier than all other things that lodge in the ear. As for removing worms produced within the ear when treated according to what was mentioned in the chapter on otorrhea without success...
It is not permissible to look into the ear in sunlight. If you see something of a worm, remove it with tweezers or gentle tongs. If nothing appears, take a tube shaped like this.
Take a tube that is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. Insert its thin end into the ear to the extent that the patient can bear it, then use a strong syringe to suck out as much of the worm as possible. If this does not work, seal around the tube with wax as mentioned earlier for stones.
If it still does not come out with the aforementioned methods, use the ear drops mentioned earlier that have been tried by the ancients for killing worms. You will find this in the chapter on ear drops. This device is used for dripping oils and medications into the ear, and its shape is as follows:
This is what you see: it is made of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top. If you wish, make the tip of the tube inside the pipe from solid copper. If you wish, take a reed and wrap cloth tightly around its end.
Then the oil or the medication you desire is applied to the funnel which is placed in the ear, and then the syringe with its wad is inserted from above. It should be squeezed gently with your hand until the oil flows into the interior of the ear canal and is felt.
The patient should be admitted, and let what is poured into the ear be slightly warmed over a fire. Be careful that it not be too cold or hot, as the ear cannot tolerate this.
Chapter Seven
In treating acute deafness of the ear.
Some children are born from their mothers' wombs with their ears unperforated.
Additionally, some people may experience obstruction in the ear canal due to injury or excess tissue growth within it, which may not be visible due to its depth.
Sometimes, the obstruction may extend slightly out of the ear canal and be visible. However, those that are deep within the ear canal and not visible are usually harder to remove. If the obstruction is visible, do not place the patient's ear in direct sunlight. If you look inside (the ear), and if you see an apparent obstruction, open it gently with a fine probe whose shape is like this:.
Its tip should be slightly blunted on one side while the rest of the probe is smooth on both sides to avoid harming the ear. If the obstruction is excess tissue that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it gently with a fine forceps and cut it carefully until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a fine, smooth probe and warm it slightly over fire before inserting it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction while experiencing heaviness in the ear, withdraw the probe gently.
Be careful not to injure the ear canal. Then, insert a wick into the ear according to its width and soak it in Egyptian ointment. Repeat this process several times until you are sure that the wound has healed or use a wick dipped in water mixed with powdered salt.
Use the wick. If the ear becomes inflamed and painful, do not remove the wick but replace it with another one soaked in rose oil to reduce inflammation. Continue treating it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, apply it to the ear and use other remedies mentioned in the chapter on haemorrhoids to stop the bleeding.
Chapter Eight.
In treating warts appearing on the eyelids.
This type of warts appearing on the eyelids may be wet or dry; if they are wet, hold them with forceps or tweezers and cut their roots with scissors, then apply powdered gum to the site.
If bleeding occurs, cauterize it with a hot bronze spatula and press it firmly after cutting; often it returns if some root remains. If cauterized with fire, the roots will be burnt and it will not return.
Chapter Nine.
In treating sudden inflammation of the eyelids.
It often appears in the eyelids as something similar to frost in its severity and hardness.
It is called 'cold' because of the accumulation of thick humidity in both eyelids. If it appears prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves in all directions, it is easy to treat by making a transverse cut on it.
Then gently peel it off from all sides until it detaches. Tie it with tweezers and cut it; if cutting is not possible before the eyelid penetrates, no harm will come to the patient. If the cut is large, close it with stitches and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, there is no harm in leaving it alone; the ointment will force it out and adhere to it. If the 'cold' is inclined towards the inside of the eyelid towards the inner surface, turn the eyelid over and tie the 'cold' with tweezers without making a cut, then peel it off from all sides.
If the eyelid is penetrated by the cut, there is no harm. Then wash the eye with saltwater after removing the 'cold' and treat the site with an adherent agent until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
In treating the pterygium appearing on the eyelid.
A pterygium is a fatty tissue that appears in the layers of the upper eyelid, which more commonly affects children. It causes heaviness of the eyes and inflammation during summers, making it difficult for them to look at sunlight. To make tears flow quickly.
Therefore, they are constantly leaning on their faces and sleeping on them. Their eyelids under the eyebrows are wet and swollen, with the veins of the nose prominent. When you press the spot with your fingers, you feel the vein between them. The procedure is to place the patient's head in a cloths.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare from it a wick. Make from this wick a circle equal to the size that surrounds the vein on all sides. Then place it on top and press with your fingers on all sides to gather the vein in the center of the circle.
Then make a transverse incision in the center of that wetness with the sharp scalpel, not larger than an incision for bloodletting. Do not cut too deep until you reach the vein.
In most cases, the vein will protrude from the incision like a white piece of fat. Gently pull it out using a cloth wrapped between your fingers, turning your hand right and left to free it. Beware not to increase the incision lest the scalpel slips and harms the eye.
If the vein does not appear at first, gently increase the incision a little until it becomes visible. Then pull it out as mentioned before. Dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the spot to tie it tightly. Some people use salt instead.
He places it in the bottom of the incision to dissolve any remaining wetness, then dress it until it heals. If inflammation occurs at the site, treat it with musk ointment until it heals.
Chapter Eleven
On Types of Eye Inflammation.
If excess eyelashes grow on the eye outside their natural course and become intertwined, they cause harm to the eye and lead to conditions such as constant tearing, drooping of the eyelids, whitening, and thickening to the point of causing blindness.
Eye inflammation occurs in four forms: either by cauterization with fire or with a strong medicine, as mentioned earlier under the chapter on cautery; or it may be due to laceration and suturing, or by cantharides ointment.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap, then turn his eyelid with your left hand. If it does not invert, insert a needle with a thread from below the eyelid and pass it through above near the lashes, then pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.
Then turn it with the ointment, and make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid below the excessive hair using a sharp bistoury from the outer angle to the inner angle. Then pass the thread through and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton or linen, then stitch up the eyelid with the needle.
Like the shape of a fig leaf, except that it should be according to how much you want to elevate the eyelid, for this differs among people. Some may require cutting away an appropriate amount from the eyelid according to how much it droops.
And among them is one who requires less cutting, according to the drooping of the eyelid. Then make an incision with the bistoury on the two lines you have marked, starting from the outer angle to the inner angle, and each incision should be close to the natural lashes, like the thickness of a needle.
Then insert the probe into one of the skin angles, then pass it through all of it. Then sew up the edges with a fine wool thread and needle, wipe away any blood, and stick the remaining threads on the eyebrows with some appropriate substance if necessary.
If you wish, you may do this, otherwise it makes no difference. Then leave the stitches and threads for about three to four days before treating it. If you prefer, you may leave the wound without stitching and treat it with something that dries and contracts, for the eyelid will elevate upon closing the wound and sewing is preferable.
This method of pleating was mentioned by the ancients, but it is burdensome for the patient and not recommended. Another method of pleating is to mark on the eyelid a shape like that of a fig leaf as described earlier. Then elevate the eyelid with three probes, either separate or grouped in this manner:
Then trim the remaining eyelid with small scissors like this, cutting moderately:
If you cannot restrain the sneezing and it does not subside, then take a needle with thread attached and insert it into the middle of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger opening and a third near the smaller opening. Gently gather the threads between your fingers, then raise them slowly while lifting your hand moderately.
Raise the skin lifted on it entirely as we have described, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If there is a hot swelling at your cut or incision, soothe that swelling with camphor and similar anesthetic ointments.
The lower eyelid may also have its margins turn inward, so it is better not to use cautery with fire or strong medicine on it.
Cautery with moxa should be performed in this manner: invert the eyelid and make an incision inside as described, then prepare two thin moxa sticks or splints equal in length to the eyelid and narrower than a lancet in width.
Also, cut off their tips from both sides where the threads are attached, then gently bring them together on the remaining eyelid and tie them tightly on both sides and leave it like that for some days; the stretched skin will die, turn black, and decay.
Until it falls off by itself; if it delays, cut it with scissors and treat it until it heals. When the eyelid becomes adherent, raise it gently without damaging the eyelashes. Here is a drawing of the splints made in this shape and size:
Chapter Twelve
On raising ingrown eyebrows with a needle.
If it is one or two hairs causing the problem, take a fine needle and insert into it a thin, smooth silk thread. Tie its ends together with a very gentle knot, making the length of the thread about a cubit (yard).
Then attach another fine thread to it without tying its ends, and the patient should lie down facing the sun so that the work is clearly visible. Then insert the needle with the attached thread into the root of the excess hair.
Insert it into the eyelid with force until it emerges above the natural hair, then pull the thread upwards towards the incision and insert that hair if it is one, two, or three at most.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the incision from the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you have pulled the incision but the hair has not come out with it, then pull the incision downwards using the thread that was attached to it until the incision comes out of the upper hole.
Then put the hair back in it and pull them both until they rise up in the upper hole and you see them with the eye, then cut the incision and thread and remove them and leave the eye taut for two or three days until the hair takes its place and flesh grows on it.
If the hair is short, either attach a long strand of natural hair to it so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer later and then raise it.
Chapter Thirteen
In treating strabismus occurring in the upper eyelid of the eye.
This strabismus is called "entropion" and may be either congenital or acquired. The acquired kind usually results from trauma, injury, or disease etc.
The procedure is to cut open the adhesion, separate its edges, and insert a cotton thread between them. Tie it until healed. Avoid using drying agents that cause constriction.
But if you do this, the entropion will return worse than before. Instead, use relaxing agents such as ground fenugreek seeds mixed with water, crushed linseed oil and diacilion ointment mixed with a little olive oil to moisten the cotton thread used for treatment.
The goal of treatment is to prevent the recurrence of entropion in its original form. The procedure mentioned above is one way to repair it, but not necessarily to restore the area to its original condition.
Chapter Fourteen
In treating entropion occurring in the lower eyelid
This string that is made from intestines is what is called the true suture, and it can be natural or accidental. The accidental ones occur due to a wound, cut, ulceration, or similar.
In its application, one takes a needle with double thread and inserts it into the flesh, passing from the left mouth to the right until the thread appears at both ends of the flesh. Then the flesh is pulled upwards with the needle and cut with broad scissors.
If the eyelid returns as intended, otherwise take a probe and place it at the site of the incision. Then turn the eyelid with it and make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid so that their ends meet at the corners of the cut, forming an angle. Until when they meet, its shape becomes similar to this:
Which resembles the Greek letter lambda. Then that flesh is removed to the extent that its sharp side is below the eyelid, then the dispersed parts are joined together with two sutures using wool thread, and finally it is treated with the mentioned soothing and wrapping remedies until it heals.
If the suture was accidental due to a cut, stitching, ulceration or similar, it is necessary to make a simple incision without hair at the location mentioned earlier and then separate the lips with twisting as previously described.
The sum of treatment for suture whether from above or below is that the work be done according to what appears feasible regarding its form, as it may vary greatly in appearance. The experienced physician finds a way whatever the situation.
So that the shape returns to its natural form or approaches it, and the disease itself indicates what procedure and instrument are most appropriate in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
Chapter Fifteen: In adhesion of the eyelid to the globe or cornea.
This adhesion may occur in many people, where the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye preventing its free movement and hindering its natural functions. In such case, a probe tip should be inserted under the eyelid.
He raises it above or extends it with a hook, then cuts the adhesion with a fine scissor that is not sharp-pointed but slightly curved so as not to cause discomfort to the patient during the procedure. The cutting should be done gently like peeling off the adhesion.
After the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the adhesion is completely healed, you should then apply salt water to wash the eye or instill in it drops of camphor water mixed with water. Then, separate the eyelid from the eye using a cotton wick.
Place a moistened bandage made of egg white above the eye and after three days, apply cupping glasses until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen
In cutting the foreskin and excising flesh from the glans penis.
The foreskin has two kinds: either nerve-like, resembling a solid thin membrane, or non-nervous resembling firm white mucilage that sticks to iron when touched and can be grasped with tongs and cut off.
And do not grasp it with tongs. Both kinds begin from the largest meatus until it becomes slightly thicker, covering the eye and preventing light and eye movement. The procedure for cutting it is to place the patient's head on your lap.
Then open his eyes, lift the eyelid with your hand, grasp the foreskin with a slightly curved tongs and extend it upwards. Take a needle, insert into it a horse or cow hair thread and tie it tightly. Bend one end of the needle slightly and pierce it in the middle of the foreskin.
Pass the needle through it, tie the foreskin with the thread and extend it upwards. Use the hair to scrape off the side of the foreskin near the pupil as if you are peeling it until its end. Then cut off the remaining part at the base of the meatus using a fine scissor or small forceps. Leave the natural flesh of the meatus intact.
So that it does not cause constant tearing of the lachrymal ducts. You can extend the foreskin with tongs alone or with thread as mentioned earlier, then scrape off its edge using a smooth-ended scissor which looks like this:
Take care that the scalpel does not touch the conjunctiva, causing a cut through which the pupil may prolapse. After cutting, powdered salt or Indian indigo should be applied to the eye and left overnight before treating it as necessary until it heals.
If the tumor is non-neural and an needle cannot be inserted or a thread attached, it is often treated with drugs that will heal as described in the section. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
And take a fine, smooth, and blunt scalpel resembling this shape: Gently scrape the tumor from above with the scalpel until it becomes loose and crumbles. If bleeding occurs, pour Indian indigo or red ochre powder into the eye immediately, apply some powdered salt, and leave the eye alone overnight.
Then prepare to perform the operation until all of it is removed, except if you encounter a hot tumor in the eye, leave it alone and treat the hot tumor until it heals. Then resume the operation by scraping until it heals.
If the pterygium causes severe eye pain, tie it with a thread and cut off some of it, but do not cut too deeply to avoid excessive tearing. Then apply red ochre or Indian indigo powder to the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cutting the pterygium and any excess flesh growing in the eye.
Some people's eyes may grow red, overlapping flesh that covers or approaches the pupil or overflows onto the eyelids, sometimes even causing the eyelids to turn outward like a pomegranate flower.
The procedure is for the patient to lie down on their back while you open their eyes and tie up all of that red flesh with appropriate threads.
Or, grasp it with tweezers or forceps and cut the flesh piece by piece until all of it is removed. Be careful not to injure the eye during the operation. You can use either the scalpel described for cutting tumors or small scissors. How to catch the thread as its picture appears in the following chapter.
If after cutting, all the veins are gone, fill the eye with crushed salt or drop into it red rose water and similar medications. Then apply from outside a cloth soaked in egg white to protect against inflammation.
If there remains some veins, bleeding is profuse and you fear inflammation, leave the eye alone and treat it with something to calm inflammation. Then return to operating on it until it heals. Do likewise for excess flesh that appears in the eye of this kind.
But it is not permissible for you to treat any weak eye by cauterization or operation with iron, nor should you put your hand to such work until you see that this member is capable of enduring it.
Chapter Eighteen.
How to catch the thread from the eye.
If there are blood vessels tangled on the eye which prevent sight and weaken it over time, first look to see if the eye containing these vessels is strong and has no other disease besides them.
Then, the lancing should be done by ordering the patient to place their head in your lap. Then tie those vessels with one or two hooks according to your skill. The hooks should be bent like this:
Or two hooks combined into one body like this:
Then cut those vessels gently with fine scissors, wiping away the blood occasionally until you see that all of them are gone from the eye and the bleeding stops. Be careful not to harm the eye with the points of the scissors. Do this work midday facing the sun.
And be careful in your work not to cut anything other than those vessels. When you are finished, drop green or red saffron into the eye to cauterize any remaining vessels. If you cannot complete the cutting at that time, dress the eye with something to relieve its pain.
Leave it for some days until its pain subsides and inflammation is prevented. Then return to operating on it in this same manner until the eye recovers from this cutting.
Leave him [the patient], and let the head be within the student's chamber, and let not a tear remain nor any discharge flow from before the eye. The essence of the procedure is to open the eye with forceps or tweezers held by an apprentice.
Detect [the pulse], and let the head be within the apprentice's chamber, and let not a tear remain nor any discharge flow from before the eye. Your choice is to begin by pulling from above the eye or below it; the former is preferable. Remove two hairs from the upper eyebrow – one at its tip and one at its beginning.
Hold it between the middle finger and the thumb, then attach hooks underneath its sides. Then hold it between the little finger and the ring finger, and gently pull your hand until you see all of the eyelid elevated. Cut from the smaller corner, either with scissors or fine tweezers.
Do not drop the speculum upon its edge, and stretch out all of the eyelid until it rests on the cheekbone. Do not cut the lachrymal duct, for tears and blood will obstruct you.
Then cut with scissors what is beyond the cilia from above and below, leaving no hair attached except at the cannthus. If you can raise it from there with the speculum, it is better; otherwise, it may become inflamed in some people.
And if it was cut, its pain will subside after several days and the swelling will abate. Then resume working on it.
Chapter Nineteen.
On returning the feather to the nose.
The doctors call it 'the feather'. If you treat it with cupping or burn it with strong medications mentioned earlier, but it does not heal, the only remedy is to cut into the swelling when it becomes ripe and extract all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed. If you see decay or blackness in the bone, scrape it with an instrument shaped like this:
And it is called the 'coarse-headed' instrument, made of Indian iron with a round head like a mortar. Engrave it finely either 'Mbard' or 'Esclafej', then place it on the site of bone decay and turn it between your fingers while slightly squeezing your hand until you know that the decay has been scraped off.
He repeated this procedure several times, then he treated the site with dry, astringent medications. If the wound closed and flesh grew over it, and no further flow occurred, he would leave it alone for forty days. During this period, there was no recurrence of the condition, nor did any other incident occur.
Know that he has recovered, otherwise there is no other treatment for him except to replace the nasal pack into its original position in the nostril using this method: exposing the bone again with iron or a caustic medication. Then take a curved hook shaped like this:
The tip of the iron should be shaped like a triangle, and its shaft should be cone-shaped and tapered towards the tip as you see. Then place it on the bone itself near the nasal cavity and slightly away from the eye. Rotate your hand with the hook until you feel the bone penetrate and the patient senses it.
When he feels the breath coming out of it upon placing his hand over his nose, then you should treat the site with dry, astringent medications as I have instructed. If flesh grows and the area solidifies, the matter that was previously exiting will return to the nostril, which will be easier for the patient, if God wills.
Chapter Twenty.
On the Return of Tears in the Eye.
If the eye produces tears continuously without any damage to vision, it is advisable for the patient to be separated from others and placed in a dark room. Then place a plaster on his forehead without restriction and apply a thin poultice.
Then place on the eye a poultice made from acacia gum, myrrh, honey, and frankincense. Then bind the eye tightly from above with many bandages, the recipe for which is to take many soft cloths, fold each one into four layers, and make many of them.
Then place one bandage on top of another according to the eye's requirement, then secure it with a strong, tight cloth. Then reapply the plaster without restriction and leave the eye bound for one day and night.
If the bandage loosens during this time, it should be tightened again. Then remove the bandage after one day and night as mentioned before. If the eye has not returned to its original state, repeat the procedure with the bandages, poultices, tightening, and plaster until it does.
Chapter Twenty-One
In cutting the veins
If a vein in the layer of the veins becomes prolapsed and protrudes outside the eyelids causing disfigurement, then it should be cut as follows:
It is to insert a needle into the base of the vein from below upwards, then insert another needle with a double thread into it from the direction of the wound and pass it through, leaving the first needle as it is.
Then cut the loop of the double thread and tie it around the vein near the needle, pulling it gently. Then remove the needle and place wet cotton wool soaked in egg white on the eye until the veins fall off. Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.
Until the wound heals, the veins can be tied from all sides with a thread to increase the swelling of the eye gently. Then use a thin probe that reaches the depth of the eye to remove the egg white fluid and let the eye dry naturally until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two
On treating Cataracts.
This ailment called cataract is nothing but a cloud that forms in the eye resembling water without any flow. The procedure for this is to seat the patient on an upright chair and hold their head with both hands.
Move the patient's head until you see the cloud descend to the bottom of their eye, then stop and do not let go. If light is restored and the patient can see objects as before, it means that the cataract has descended. If it does not descend despite your efforts, know that it is water.
Otherwise, seat the patient in front of you and take a thin probe. Make a small incision above the corneal limbus with it until the aqueous humor is released.
If it does come out, pour warm water mixed with barley flour or hot water boiled with fenugreek and barley into the eye. Then treat with other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three
We have mentioned the types of water in the section and which is suitable for cupping in detail. So take it from there according to the patient's condition. Then seat the patient facing you, close to a light source like sunlight.
Bind the healthy eye and tie it firmly, then lift its eyelid with your left hand if it is the left eye where there is water, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the tip of the probe near the pupil with firm pressure on the same side of the eye towards the inner canthus, then push the probe forcefully while turning it with your hand until you feel that it has reached an empty space.
It is necessary that the distance which the probe penetrates should be equal to the distance from the white of the eye to the pupil, which is the black spot at the center of the eye. Then bring the probe upwards to the location where there is water.
Then press it down repeatedly. If the water flows out immediately, then the patient will see clearly and the probe should be left in place for a short time. If the water rises instead, then lower it again without removing the probe.
Once it has settled and does not rise again, gently remove the probe while rotating your hand slightly. Then dissolve a small amount of pure salt in water and wash the eye internally with it, then place a wick soaked in olive oil or wool moistened with water externally over the whole eye.
If the probe does not enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes, then grind cumin seeds with egg white and apply it. Alternatively, use rose oil and white of egg to soften the eye and bind the healthy eye with it. You should take the probe called "Al-Burdah" which looks like this:.
Pierce only the skin of the temple with it and do not make a deep puncture, but merely make a slight opening for the probe, then insert the probe as mentioned earlier. When you have completed your procedure, prepare for the patient a comfortable, dark room where he can lie down on his back to sleep.
He should refrain from all movements and coughing, and his food should be soft and suitable for him. He should not turn his head to the right or left at all. The bandage should remain in place until the third day, then it should be removed in that dark room and his sight should be tested.
It shows three things, then the bandage is returned on the seventh day. It is not permissible to do this during treatment or after drawing blood from your wrist; rather, it should be avoided before water rises rapidly due to intense looking.
If a hot tumor appears, it is necessary to cover the eye before the seventh day and treat it with something that alleviates the tumor until it subsides. Then, uncover his sight and place on his face a bandage that directs his gaze downward while he remains in that dark house.
He gradually leaves the house and behaves according to his condition. Know that the learner cannot dispense with observation in bloodletting; therefore, he proceeds with caution when performing it. It has reached me that some Iraqis mention a certain device used there for bloodletting which is perforated to allow water to be drawn through.
I have not seen anyone in our land make this device nor have I read about it in the books of the ancients, and it may be something recent. Here are images of various types of bloodletting cups for those unfamiliar with them:
It is made of copper, particularly; its tip has this specific shape: triple-pointed and sharp.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In treating the flesh growing in the nose.
There are different types of excess flesh that can grow in the nose, including something resembling a polyp with many legs; some are hard, dark-colored tumors; and others are soft and not dark-colored.
If the flesh is soft and not malignant or cancerous, have the patient sit facing the sun and open their nostril. Insert tweezers into that flesh and pull it out, then cut what has been grasped using a sharp, fine scissors on one side.
Continue doing this until all the flesh is removed. If there is any remaining that you cannot cut, scrape it off gently using one of the delicate instruments to ensure none remains. If bleeding occurs or a hot tumor appears,
Treat it appropriately or, if it is one of the malignant tumors, hasten to cauterize until bleeding stops and all flesh is removed. Then rinse the nose with clean water or a drink after cutting.
Know that it has healed. If the moisture did not reach its intended goal, know that there is a bony projection within the hollow bone that the tool could not reach for cutting. In this case, you should take a wick of linen with some thickness.
And tie many knots in it, leaving the space of about a finger or less between each knot. Then the patient should insert one end of the wick gently into his nose, or as much as he can tolerate after shaping it like a probe, and pull on its other end until it reaches the sinus.
And he should bring it out through his throat, for children often perform this action in schools and it is easy for those who desire it. Then gather the two ends of the wick together, the one that comes out through the mouth and the other that remains in the nose.
Then use the flesh knife at the knots in the wick, doing so until you know that the flesh has been cut by the knot of the wick. Then remove the wick and leave a wick dipped in Egyptian ointment in its place for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all remaining flesh, then leave a lead tube in its place until it heals. If further treatment is needed to dry it out, then use that method.
This is an image of the dropper used for administering drops into the nose:
It consists of a small silver or bronze funnel-shaped vessel with an opening and channel like that of a lamp.
And if you wish, you can make the tube closed like a pipe, and the spout of the dropper flat.
It has a handle at its end as shown, so that it can be held when applying oil or any other liquid substances or medicines.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On Nasal Polypi.
A polyp often grows at the tip of the nose, becoming larger and more prominent over time until it becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut off a polyp as soon as it appears and remove all of it. Then cauterize the area with either caustic iron or a burning medicine. If it was not cut off early enough and has become large and hard like a nodule with little sensation, then examine it.
No iron should be applied to him, for it is a cancerous tumor. I have often seen this tumor cut off, only for great pain to return to the patient afterwards. The tumor is soft and not hard or discolored, yet its removal is possible in its entirety. The patient vomited and tore it off without caution or delay. The area was treated with an astringent to dry and contract until it healed.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear. If their connection becomes separated due to an injury or the like, know that if this separation occurs in one of these membranes, very little can be done except in some people.
If any of these parts is affected by something, examine if the wound is fresh and bleeding. If so, suture the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals. But if the separation has already occurred and both sides are cleanly separated, do not peel off the skin with a scalpel lest it bleed.
Then sew the edges together, tighten them, and apply a mixture of wax and flour. Cover it with a plaster made from fresh butter or other melted ointment and leave it on for two to three days before removing it.
Change the dressing and leave it until the threads fall out on their own. Then treat it with ointment until it heals. The stitching can be done either with needles as described for abdominal suturing, or with thread as explained there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the removal of cysts appearing on the lips.
Many people have small, hard tumors resembling raisins inside their lips. You should turn the lip over and cut around each tumor, then hook it out with forceps.
Cut around each tumor on all sides, then fill the site with powdered frankenincense to stop the bleeding. Rinse with vinegar and salt, and apply an astringent until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eighth
In removing excessive flesh from the gums
It often happens that excessive flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called polyp. It should be grasped with forceps or held with tweezers and cut at its base, then allow the bleeding to cease before applying powdered gum as a dressing
Or one of the dried and hardened warts. If the flesh returns after treatment, cut it again and cauterize it; for it will not return after that.
Chapter Twenty-Ninth
In extracting teeth with iron
Hard and unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of teeth, both internally and externally, and between the gums. These scales can become blackened, yellowed, or greenish, causing decay to reach the gums and spoil the teeth
One should sit the patient before oneself, with their head resting on one's lap. Using iron tools, scrape away the hard scales and sandy matter from the visible tooth until nothing remains, likewise for blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other blemishes, until it is cleaned
If the first scraping does not remove all of it, repeat the process on a later day, then again a third time until the desired result is achieved. Know that molars require various types of scrapers with different shapes according to the nature of the work
Because the scraper used to clean inside a molar is different from that used outside, and also different for cleaning between molars. Have all these various types of scrapers ready for use:
Chapter Thirty
In extracting teeth
It is necessary to treat the tooth from its pain with all possible means and avoid extraction if at all possible, for it is a noble structure. Only extract it if absolutely necessary
If the patient decides to have it extracted, ensure that you accurately identify the painful tooth For the patient is often deceived by pain, believing it to be in the correct tooth when it is extracted. Yet the pain does not go away until they extract the diseased tooth, as we have seen many times with barbers.
If you find that a painful tooth requires extraction, it is necessary to circumcise around the tooth with a sharp instrument of moderate strength until the gum is detached from all sides. Then move it slightly using your fingers or gentle forceps little by little until it becomes loose.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps and place the patient's head between your knees, ensuring it does not move. Pull the tooth straight out without breaking it. If it does not come out, use one of these tools to gently insert it under each side of the tooth and push it until it comes loose.
If the tooth is hollow or decayed, fill that cavity with a bandage and secure it tightly with a fine ribbon to prevent fraying while gripping it with forceps. Then circumcise around the gum meticulously from all sides.
Be careful not to break the tooth and leave some part of it inside, causing more harm than its initial pain. Avoid acting recklessly like inexperienced barbers who attempt difficult operations without following these instructions.
Many times they cause great harm to people, the easiest of which is breaking the tooth and leaving all or some of its roots inside. Or they may extract some of the jawbone, as we have seen many times. After extraction, rinse with water or vinegar mixed with salt. If bleeding occurs at the site, crumble some gum resin and apply it there.
Otherwise, if gum resin does not help, here is the shape of the gentle forceps used initially to move the tooth: long at the ends and short in the handle, thick so it does not bend when gripping the tooth. Here is the shape of the large forceps:
As shown, it has thick handles that do not slip or bend. It should be made of Indian iron or steel with sharp edges at the tips that fit together tightly when closed.
The extremities should be made like those of a mace, also strong and well-controlled.
Chapter 13.
In extracting the roots of teeth and removing broken jawbones.
After extracting a tooth whose root has broken, place a linen cloth soaked in oil for one or two days until the area relaxes, then introduce tweezers or forceps. This resembles the beak of a bird called al-bulrijah, and this is an image of the forceps:
If it cannot be removed with these forceps, then carve out the root and strip away all the flesh using a scalpel, then insert this tool resembling a small crowbar whose image is as follows:
Short and thick but not too blunt lest it break; if the root comes out this way, otherwise use these other instruments whose image is as follows, the first being three-pronged with some thickness:
This is another trident-like image:
We can also use this instrument with two branches whose image is as follows:
And other instruments and drills mentioned in the chapter on teeth, we can also use this tool resembling a large awl whose image is as follows:
A three-pronged tool curved with some thickness but not too blunt lest it break, and not too sharp; know that there are many dental instruments as well as other tools which cannot be numbered, and a skilled craftsman may devise for himself instruments according to the requirements of the work and diseases themselves.
For some diseases which have not been mentioned by earlier authors due to their variety, if a bone in the jaw or one of the bones of the face breaks or becomes inflamed, search for it at its location using any suitable tool or forceps mentioned in extracting roots.
And we use tweezers whose image is as follows:
There should be some thickness to hold the bone firmly so it does not slip out, then apply appropriate medications to the area. If there is slight decay, clean and purify it until it heals.
Section Twenty-Three
In excising impacted teeth.
Teeth, if they grow in a manner other than their natural course, mar the beauty of the face, especially when this happens to women or young boys. Therefore, it should be examined; if the tooth has grown from behind another tooth.
And if it cannot be extracted nor pushed back, cut it off with this instrument which resembles this image:
It resembles a small beak and should be made of Indian steel, very sharp at the tip. Cutting should take place over many days due to the hardness of the tooth and to avoid shaking other teeth. But if it is protruding and can be extracted, extract it with a pair of forceps which resembles this image.
It should all be made of iron with the tip being very thinly crafted like a needle. Warm the tooth gently over many days using this pair of forceps to prevent shaking and falling out of the tooth, then grasp it firmly and remove its covering with some tweezers.
If a tooth has broken off some of its part causing discomfort to the tongue while speaking, then it should also be warmed gently until that roughness disappears and becomes smooth without causing discomfort to the tongue nor hindering speech.
Section Thirty-Three
On binding loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth are loose due to an impact or fall and the patient cannot chew food without them falling out, despite treatment with astringent medications that have not been effective.
Then, bind them with a thread of gold or silver; gold is better because silver tends to tarnish and corrode over time. The thread should be moderate in thickness, neither too thin nor too thick according to the space between the teeth.
The method of binding is to take the thread and insert its loop between the two healthy teeth, then stitch it through the gap between the loose teeth until the stitching reaches the other side of the healthy teeth.
Then you return the suture to the side where it began, gently and wisely pulling your hand so that it does not move at all; your tension on the thread should be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip. Then you cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them together and twist them with tweezers, concealing them between the sound tooth and the displaced one.
Lest the tongue be harmed, then you leave it like this tied until it remains thus forever. If it breaks or its tension slackens, reinforce it with another thread and it will remain thus for all eternity. This is an image of the teeth and their arrangement in two sound teeth and two displaced ones as you see:
And a single tooth or both may return to their places after falling out, becoming fixed as described above and remaining so. Indeed, this is the work of a skilled craftsman, who can even carve bone from oxen in the shape of teeth and place it where the tooth has gone missing. And he ties it as we have said, and it remains thus forever.
Chapter Forty-Three
In the cutting of the frenulum that hinders speech.
This frenulum under the tongue may be either natural, present at birth, or accidental, resulting from a wound that has healed.
The procedure is to open the patient's mouth and elevate their head in your lap, then raise their tongue and cut across the frenulum until the tongue is released from its restraint. If it is somewhat hard and complex, being a result of scar tissue from a healed wound, then incise it with scissors and cut across until the frenulum is severed and the ties are loosened.
And beware that the incision is not too deep, lest you cut a blood vessel there and cause bleeding. Then rinse with rosewater or vinegar and cold water after the cutting. And place under the tongue a wick of cotton for the patient to hold in their mouth each night.
Lest it adhere again. If bleeding occurs, apply powdered gum tragacanth to the place. If bleeding persists, cauterize the area with a suitable glass spatula. Then treat him with all kinds of treatment until he recovers.
Chapter Thirty-Five
In expelling the toad born under the tongue.
A tumor resembling a small toad may occur under the tongue, preventing it from its natural function and perhaps filling the mouth entirely. The procedure is as follows: open the patient's mouth towards the sun and observe the tumor.
If it appears red or black, hard, and insensitive to touch, do not intervene for it is cancerous. However, if it tends towards whiteness with dampness present, pierce it with a fine needle and cut it out with scissors from all sides.
If bleeding troubles you during the procedure, sprinkle powdered bdellium on it until the bleeding stops. Then resume your work until you remove it entirely. Then rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat him with appropriate remedies until he recovers.
Chapter Thirty-Six
On treating a swelling of the tonsils.
And if a growth appears within the throat, resembling the glands that appear externally and are called tonsils, and does not heal with the remedies mentioned in the previous section...
If the tumor is hard, dark in color, and insensitive to touch, do not treat it with an iron instrument. If it is red in color and its origin is thick, also do not treat it with an iron instrument for fear of bleeding. Leave it alone until it ripens, either to fall off or to burst on its own.
But if it is white, rounded, and its origin is thin, this is what should be cut. First, ensure that the heat of the tumor has subsided completely or somewhat before proceeding with the procedure.
Then seat the patient facing the sun, with his head in your lap. Open his mouth and take a spatula in your hand, using it to press down on his tongue as follows:
Make a thin silver or copper spatula, like a blade. Press it on the tongue to reveal the tumor and then pierce it with a fine needle and pull it out as much as possible without damaging any surrounding tissues.
Then it is cut with this tool, its shape resembling scissors, but with curved ends, each one sharp against the other. It is made of Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If this tool is not available, then cut it with a probe, which resembles this shape
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting one gland, cut the other in the same manner. Then, rinse the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
If there is bleeding, rinse with water in which pomegranate peel or oak leaves have been steeped until the bleeding stops. Then treat it until it heals. There may also grow other tumors in the throat besides the tonsils; these are to be cut as mentioned for cutting the tonsils.
I treated a woman for a tumor that had grown inside her throat, striking the epiglottis with little sensation. It almost completely blocked her throat, causing her to breathe through a narrow passage and preventing her from eating or drinking.
She was near death, having only one or two days left to live. The tumor had grown so large that two branches of it protruded from her nostrils. I acted quickly and inserted a probe into one of the branches, then pulled it out, removing a suitable piece of the growth.
Then I cut it where I reached it from the nostril. Then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth, pushed down her tongue, inserted the probe into the tumor itself and cut off a piece of it without causing much bleeding.
The woman's throat cleared immediately, and she began drinking water right away. Then she was able to eat again. We continued cutting the tumor repeatedly over a long period of time, but it kept growing back.
So she recovered and the tumor in her throat ceased to grow larger, then she left the area and I do not know what happened to her after that.
Chapter Seventy-Three
In cutting tumors of the uvula
If a swelling appears on the uvula, which resembles an ant (thus named "ubna"), and does not respond to treatment with what has been mentioned regarding division
I saw the hot tumor had subsided and was thin, it should not be cut; for it was not solid and round nor long, and its color was not bloody or black nor did it have any sensation. Therefore, it should be avoided from being cut.
If there is growth in the patient, then if you see it with the characteristics mentioned of whiteness and length, let the patient sit beside the sun and press his tongue with the tool that has been described before, then insert the trocar into the vein.
And pull it downwards and cut it with one of the tools mentioned for cutting tonsils. Do not cut more than what is beyond its natural size, otherwise you would harm the voice and speech.
Then after cutting, use what we described for cutting tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is reluctant to cut it, do not resort to trickery without caution; the face of the deceit in this case is the sharp drug, which is putting the head of the patient into a millstone.
Then press his tongue with the tool mentioned, then take from the sharp water mentioned in the chapter on cupping and knead it with a glowing iron not extinguished, making it neither thick nor thin, and fill this tool with it. This is its shape:
It has a tip for placing the drug like the concavity of a spoon, and you place the tool with the drug on the tonsil itself while the patient lies on his side so that no saliva from within his throat falls into it to harm him.
Then hold your hand with the drug and press it on the tonsil for half an hour until you see that it has turned black and the burning sensation has subsided. If you wish, wrap a piece of linen around the tip of a spoon and dip it in the drug.
Then insert the spoon with the linen into a tube from above until the linen sticks to the tonsil. Do this repeatedly until you reach the desired amount of cupping, then leave it alone; it will dry and fall off after three or four days. If you need to repeat the drug, prepare it again.
After cauterization, wipe around the tonsil with a linen soaked in sesame oil and use it to wipe away any surrounding medicine. Then rinse with cold water and treat externally with poultices and internally with gargling until healed; this method is safer than cutting and far from causing fear.
The tonsils can also be treated gently without cautery or cutting by applying incense made according to this method: take equal amounts of fleawort, saffron, savory, sage, hyssop, opopanax and similar herbs, grind them together in a mortar with vinegar.
Melt the mixture in an earthenware pot over a slow fire, stirring with the pestle of wisdom. In the center of the lid make a hole through which to insert the siphon apparatus made of silver or copper according to this method:.
Insert the tip containing the wick into the patient's mouth until the vapor reaches the tonsils via the tube, thoroughly steaming them. Repeat this several times until they soften. Avoid using this treatment at the onset of the swelling.
For if you do this at the onset of swelling, it will often increase its size. Rather, wait until the hot swelling has subsided. If you do not have this apparatus, take a reed and insert a thin egg shell into one end to prevent the patient's mouth from burning.
For the eggshell prevents the hot vapor from burning the mouth, making this a safe and effective treatment:.
Chapter Eighty-Three
In extracting splinters and other foreign bodies from the throat.
Often, bone or fish spines, among other things, become lodged in the throat. It is necessary to remove what can be seen clearly after pressing down the tongue using an instrument held in the sun:.
So that you can see clearly what is in the throat, and if something cannot be seen, make the patient vomit before digestion begins in the stomach. Perhaps the lodged object will come out with the vomiting or can be dislodged with a piece of soft cloth or gauze soaked in olive oil:.
Or, use a piece of dry bread soaked in oil or take a piece of soft sea sponge tied to a thread and insert it until it reaches the location of the spine. Then quickly pull out the thread several times:.
Frequently, the bone or splinter remains attached and does not come out; if it does not come out as mentioned previously, then use an instrument made of lead in this form:
The instrument should be slightly thicker than a needle and have a hook at its end which the patient inserts into their throat gently while raising their head upwards, taking care not to touch the throat so as not to cause coughing. The doctor may also insert it with his hand,
And the patient should preferably use it themselves, as they know better the location of the foreign body and can push it downwards or pull it upwards with the instrument according to what is comfortable for them until it comes out,
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On Removing Foreign Bodies from the Throat.
If treating the foreign body with medication as mentioned earlier does not work, then look into the patient's throat when they face the sun after pressing down their tongue with the instrument described above.
If you see the foreign body, then remove it using a small tweezers or a gentle hook. If you cannot manage this, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat close to the foreign body. Then introduce an iron rod heated in fire into the tube.
Do this several times while the patient refrains from drinking water all day. Then, they should take a cup filled with cold water, open their mouth in it, swish the water around, and spit it out without swallowing any. They should shake the water occasionally.
If the foreign body does not come out as described, then fumigate the throat with hot water and use the instrument mentioned earlier to fumigate it with incense. Do this several times until it falls out.
The purpose of using incense is to take a quantity of it and light it with fire. The incense should be placed in a container covered with a lid having a hole in its center. Insert the tip of the instrument into this hole, then place the incense on it. The patient should put their mouth over the other end of the tube and close it tightly so that no smoke escapes until they feel the warmth of the incense reaching their throat.
If the phlegm does not fall into the cup, then pour repeatedly and let the patient endure thirst, eating salt and garlic but drinking no water. It must be removed by this method; here is an illustration of an instrument used to draw out phlegm from the throat.
And it resembles a lobster trap as you can see, except that it has this curved end which enters the throat, and its two ends are like the beak of a bird in their sharpness; once they grasp something, they do not let it go:
And another instrument, with which the tongue is pressed down, is a wide iron ring that fits into the mouth above the tongue; it is inserted sideways into the mouth so that the patient's mouth remains open against their will and they cannot remove it until it is taken away:
Description of the instrument used to keep the mouth open in this manner.
Chapter Forty.
In it is discussed the use of speech for crushing and breaking down tumors.
The types of tumors are many and varied, as mentioned one by one in this book. They differ in their hardness and softness from two aspects: firstly, the nature of the tumor itself, and secondly, the fluids it contains.
And the second aspect is due to the locations where they occur in the body, for a tumor that occurs in the head is not like one that occurs in the buttocks, nor is a tumor that occurs in an inflamed area like one that occurs in a joint; each has its own ruling regarding treatment.
Among tumors, some should not be crushed until the pus within them has fully ripened and completed its maturation. Others should be crushed even if the pus is still unripe, such as those that are close to joints.
For if a tumor occurs near a joint and persists until it becomes gangrenous around it, it may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing paralysis of the limb, or the tumor may be located near an important organ.
For if you delay crushing it until it fully ripens, you will have harmed the main organ nearby, or it may be located near the buttocks; in this case, crush it while it is still unripe. But it is necessary to crush only those tumors that are not fully ripe and located near the buttocks, lest gangrene should set in and penetrate into the rectum, causing corruption.
It is sometimes the case that it does not heal, and one should know the time of eruption of tumors that have fully grown; this occurs during quietness when the pain of the tumor subsides, fever abates, redness diminishes, pulsation stops, and the head of the tumor becomes soft.
It is preferable to incise the tumor at its lowest point if possible, so that the discharge flows downwards more easily or in a softer part of the tumor; and if the tumors are near the hands or feet, let the incision be made along the length of the body.
And in places where muscles, tendons, nerves, and vessels are situated, and generally in all flat places without bending, one should follow the line of that place; but if it is a fatty tumor, it is better to leave it alone.
Until it becomes fully matured as mentioned before; for if its incision is made earlier, much discharge will flow out from it and it may be dirty and foul-smelling with hard edges and base. Some tumors may be incised across the body width when necessary or according to what the organ needs.
It is preferable to use a single incision for small tumors and a wide one or many incisions according to the size of large tumors. Some tumors may require circumcision and cutting of the skin if it has become like a rag.
And sometimes, death occurs as mentioned in many books and cases, including those where an incision with three corners is made or a tumor is cut in the shape of an oak leaf.
And in some cases, a round or crescent-shaped incision may be used, and for smooth, flat tumors without a head, only a simple incision should be made. If the tumor is very large with much accumulation of matter and has been incised, it is preferable not to rush so that all the pus does not come out at once.
Rather, some of it should be taken out first, then the tumor should be tied for another day before removing more pus; this process can be repeated gradually until all of it is removed.
And particularly if the patient is weak in strength, a pregnant woman, an infant or an elderly man, the vital spirit often dissipates with the sudden discharge of pus, perhaps causing death to the patient while you are unaware. Be warned of this chapter most severely.
After removing these tumors, it is necessary to cleanse the wound and observe; if the tumor's cut is small or its breach is simple, then use gauze or cotton wadding; but if the tumor is large and the abdominal wounds are many.
It is necessary to insert a wick into each breach until they reach one another; if some of the tumor's skin or cortex has been severed, it should be stuffed with dry cotton wool or bandages made from gauze and tied in place for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, soaked in a cotton cloth and applied to the bleeding site repeatedly.
If bleeding persists, then employ the methods and treatments and dressings described in many places throughout this book and its sections; particularly if it is wintertime and the tumor site has abundant blood vessels, then apply heated linseed oil plaster.
And apply it to the site. If it is summertime and the sites are fleshy, then carry linseed oil plasters soaked in cold water and oil or water and oil until the third day, as mentioned earlier, when you should remove the tumor and cleanse it.
And use similar treatments until it heals. This is the general knowledge of treating tumors that you need, and I have mentioned specifically how to treat each type in a concise manner.
Chapter Forty-One.
Regarding the fissures on the tumors found in the scalp.
There appear on the scalp small tumors which are of the type called 'sels', containing pus in their interiors, resembling chicken eggs in appearance; they are varied in nature, some being fatty and others containing moisture resembling mud.
It contains some fluid resembling dew and broth, among other things. It also includes hardened, solid matter, none of which poses any risk when incised and removed unless a blood vessel is encountered during the process.
The procedure for incising it involves first probing it with the tool whose image is shown below, called the 'al-mads', so that you may know what it contains. If what it contains is fluid, then make your incision lengthwise and simply as follows:
Start the incision from line ~b~ to line ~g~. Once the fluid is emptied, then tear off and remove entirely the sac that was containing this fluid, leaving nothing of it at all, for it often returns if something remains.
Then, immerse a cotton pad in the boiled grease if available, or else in salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it overnight as it will eat away any remaining sac. Then repeat the process with fresh cotton the next day and the following days if necessary.
Until you are certain that no sac remains, then treat the wound with grease until it heals. But if the swelling contains fatty tissue, incise it as follows:
Make a cross-shaped incision and cut the skin around the wound edges, then tear it off from all sides. Strive to remove the fatty tissue that contains it. If you encounter a blood vessel, do as described previously. Similarly, if the swelling is hardened, incise it from its edge.
The treatment for this is as mentioned earlier. The incision on a hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and fluid, and some of these swellings on the head in certain people have no moisture at all.
I once encountered a swelling on the head of an elderly woman, hard as stone, rough and white, so solid that it could not be broken even if thrown by someone, unlike other swellings found on heads, such as those occurring in children.
At the base of the ears, make all incisions simple and shallow, making their depths from below so that the material flows down easily, then treat them with appropriate medication.
Chapter Forty-Two
In the case of boils that appear on pigs, they often appear in the neck and under the armpits and groins. They can also appear elsewhere on the body. Those that appear in the neck are usually singular but can be multiple and may merge with one another.
Every pig has its own separate peritoneum, like the ones in livestock and tumors of the head, as we have described. The types of these boils are many: some are solid, others contain fluid, and still others are malicious and do not respond to treatment.
I have seen some that appear good to the touch, their color close to that of the skin, movable in all directions, not attached to any nerve, vein or artery, and not deep-seated. It is advisable to incise it with a simple cut from top to bottom of the body along this line (~j~) to this line (~b~):
And peel it off from all sides and stretch the skin edges with tweezers or tweezers as mentioned earlier for head tumors. Extract it little by little without cutting any nerve or vessel, and let the scalpel not be too sharp.
Lest your hand slips and cuts something unintentionally, causing unnecessary cutting. If you cut a vessel or vein accidentally, put powdered wax or some cauterizing substance into the wound to stop bleeding.
Then close the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides, the wound settles, and bleeding stops. Then return to your work until you finish. Afterward, examine with your index finger if there are any remaining boils; if so, remove them and clean the area.
If there is a large vessel at the base of the boil, do not cut it off from its origin. Instead, tie it with a tight double thread and leave it until it falls off naturally without harm. Then fill the wound with boiled cotton wool moistened in Egyptian ointment before treating it.
If you cut the entire pig, then both lips of the wound should be brought together and sutured immediately after ensuring that no part remains. However, if you find that a fragment of bone remains.
It is necessary to aim for the root and essence of the cut and use stitching, as mentioned earlier. As for pigs, which contain moisture, tie them off with a simple ligature where you see signs of maturation, and place the knot below, as stated.
Then, after tying off with a ligature using Egyptian ointment and similar substances to consume any remaining corruption until you see that the wound has been cleaned, treat it with flesh-dissolving ointments until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Three.
In a cut to the throat due to an internal throat tumor.
The ancients mentioned this cut in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our land perform it. However, those suffering from angina should avoid cutting the throat as they derive no benefit from it.
To make all the vessels and lungs clear, but for those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils that is not due to tracheal cause, it is necessary to use the cut in the throat to escape suffocation.
It is necessary, if one wishes to do so, to cut the throat beneath three or four small circles of the tracheal rings, not on the cartilage, in a manner similar to the opening of the peritoneum, at this location.
Because it is fleshless and the blood vessels are far away, if the operator is timid, he should extend the skin of the throat with a probe before cutting the skin until he reaches the trachea, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then cut the peritoneum that we have described, and identify the tracheal incision by the mucus that escapes, as well as any noise or cessation of sound. Leave the wound open for a time, then close it after the danger of suffocation has passed.
Healing it alone, without cartilage, then applying medicines that promote flesh growth until it heals. The author of this book said: This phrase means only when they see the patient has blocked his throat with one of these swellings.
They went to cut the throat to enable the patient to breathe on the wound some breath and be saved from death. But they were ordered to leave the wound open until the disease passes, and this period is about three days or thereabouts.
Then they were ordered to suture the wound and treat it until it heals. What I have seen with my own eyes is that a servant took a knife and struck her throat, cutting some of the lung cartilage, so I was summoned to treat her and found her bleeding like a slaughtered animal.
I found that the blood coming from the wound was slow, so I knew it had not cut an artery or vein. The wind was escaping from the wound, so I dressed and sutured it, treating it until it healed. Nothing else happened to the servant except a slight hoarseness.
And she returned after some days to her original state. Hence we say that cutting the throat is not harmful.
Chapter Forty-Four.
Chapter Forty-Four: On incising the swelling that appears externally on the neck, known as goiter of the neck.
This tumor called 'goiter of the neck' is a large tumor the color of the skin, and it is common in women. It has two types.
Either it is natural and there is no remedy for it, or it is adventitious and has two types: one similar to fatty tumors, and the other similar to tumors caused by the twisting of the carotid artery, which is dangerous to incise. It is not permissible to perform an iron operation on it except for a small one that has been probed and searched with the speculum, if found similar to fatty tumors and not connected to any vessels. Then it should be incised like fatty tumors. And remove it along with its sac if it is in a sac, otherwise excise all of it. Then treat the site as necessary.
Chapter Fifty-Four
In Fissure on Kinds of Goods.
The goods are many, and all kinds have been mentioned in the division. Now we should explain the difference between goods and excrescences, as it is confusing. I say that an excrescence is accompanied by heat, fever, and severe pain until the inflammation subsides. And the swelling subsides, at which point the fever and severity abate. A good does not accompany heat, fever, or pain, and it is contained within a capsule called the peritoneum, which is its special covering. Its appearance is like that of an ulceration, becoming larger or smaller than a chickpea.
And it is of two kinds: either fatty or containing moisture, with various colors as mentioned in the division. Therefore, when treating a good, you should first probe and examine it using the instrument called the probe, whose image appears in the following chapter.
Determine the size of the tumor, then remove the probe and observe what comes out as a result. If moist matter of any color emerges, cut it with a simple incision as mentioned in other tumors. But if no moist matter emerges upon removing the probe, know that it is fatty.
Cut it with a cross-shaped incision like this, as I have shown you. Suspend it from the forceps and gently strip the skin from all sides, taking care to preserve the capsule along with the good if possible.
But if the capsule breaks during the procedure and you are unable to remove it intact, this happens frequently. Remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. For if any part of it remains, it will likely recur.
If you are unable to remove it completely, cauterize the wound with some caustic powder. Then close the wound and apply something that cools the inflammation. Treat it with other remedies until it heals. If the good is large, sew its lips together and treat it with ointments.
If profuse or non-profuse bleeding occurs during the procedure, quickly cauterize the area with powdered pitch. Leave it for two or three days until the wound becomes infected and the bleeding subsides. Then return to removing any remaining good.

They are made of iron and steel, quadrangular in shape with sharp ends to facilitate entry into tumors. These are called probes or sounds, and they also come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. Image of a Large Probe:

Image of a Small Probe
These probes are suitable for exploring tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities to detect bones or other objects inside them. They are round, polished, and smooth like needles, made of either Chinese copper, Spanish copper, plain copper, iron, or silver. The best ones are made of Spanish copper.
Probes can also be made of lead, suitable for exploring tortuous fistulas with gentle curves. They come in three lengths: long, medium, and short.
According to the depth and width of each fistula, probes are made with appropriate thickness. Image of a Large Lead Probe

There are many types of forceps. Simple forceps, with a single jaw, come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. Blind forceps also have three sizes. Forceps with two jaws come in three sizes as well. Curved forceps with two jaws are available too. Additionally, there are forceps with three jaws in three sizes, each useful in its respective situation.

The tips of the chisels used for cutting are limited, while the other ends are not. This is done so that they can be used to scrape off warts without fear of accidentally cutting a vein or nerve, and thus causing less discomfort to the patient.
And these are the shapes of the hooks, which come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. Picture of a large hook:
It is made of polished copper, like a mirror. At one end it resembles a broad spoon with two layers, and inside its head there is a hidden blade like the tongue of a bird, which can be moved in and out as desired.
And these are the needles used between the fingers at the base of the warts, which the patient does not feel. They come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. Picture of a large needle:
And these are the ligatures used to stop bleeding, which come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. Picture of a large ligature:
It is made of copper or tin, rounded to a length that is slightly longer than its width, as seen here. It should be smooth. You should have these types of ligatures in large and small sizes so that you can quickly stop bleeding when necessary and when no medicine is available.
But do not use them to stop bleeding in all parts of the body. Rather, use them in fleshy areas such as the thigh muscle, calf muscle, arm muscle, breast, abdomen, groin, and other similar moist flesh.
And from it, other small instruments resembling almond shells are made in this manner:
It is used to cauterize blood flow when bleeding occurs from a place of cupping or during the cutting of vein or artery. And from it, forceps are also made in this manner:
Chapter Forty-Seven.
In the illness of men's breasts.
which resembles women's breasts, some people's breasts swell at the age of puberty until they resemble those of women and remain warm and ugly. Therefore, whoever dislikes this should cut his breast with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner.
From line ~b~ to line ~j~. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with fatty medication, then stitch up the wound edges and treat it until healed. If the breast sags downwards and relaxes onto its bone like that of women.
It is necessary to cut on its upper sides with two incisions resembling a crescent shape, each connected to the other at their ends, so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one as shown in this figure. From line ~b~ to line ~j~, then peel the skin between the incisions and remove the fat, and use stitching and forceps and whatever treatment is necessary until healed.
If the required cutting is not sufficient due to anxiety of the patient or bleeding, it is necessary to fill the wound with cotton soaked in hot wax and leave it until the remaining fat is eaten away, then treat it until healed.
Chapter Forty-Eight
In the swelling that appears under the armpit.
These swellings that appear under the armpit are of a type called hard pigs, some contain fluid while others do not. If it contains fluid, it is necessary to cut it with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner.
From line ~b~ to line ~j~. If all the contents of the swelling have been discharged, then pack it with hot waxed cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
He treats it with a suitable plaster until it heals. If the swelling is of the type of pig's boil, then cut it as mentioned in the section on pig boils, whether it progresses to the extent that pus flows. Use cataplasm for it as previously mentioned.
Chapter Forty-Nine
In cutting a swelling that appears due to an artery or vein, called anurusma.
If the artery is injured and its skin above becomes detached, swelling often results from that, likewise if a vein presents with inflammation and swelling.
The signs by which it is known whether the swelling and inflammation are due to an artery or a vein: if it is from an artery, it will be rectangular and concentrated deep in the body; if you press on the swelling with your finger, it feels like there's a crunching sound.
What is from the vein will be a round swelling on the surface of the body; cutting into these swellings is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, neck, and other many places on the body. They are often very large and should not be avoided treatment with iron cautery.
And those that are in the extremities or head should also not be avoided. If it is from an arterial aneurysm, cut along its length on the skin, then open the cut with forceps and tie off the artery and cleanse it of adventitia.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath and pass it to the other side; tie the artery with a double thread in two places as you were taught regarding the arteries in the ears, then excise the place between the ligatures using scissors until all the blood comes out of it.
The swelling will subside and then use treatment that brings about suppuration until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with suitable plasters until it heals.
If the swelling is due to a vein cut, grasp as much of it with your hand as possible along with its skin; then insert a needle underneath from where you grasped it, passing through it with a doubled thread until it exits on the other side. Then tie it to the tumor with a good knot, as you have been instructed for tying an artery from both ends of the thread; but if you fear that the threads may slip out, insert another needle with another thread beneath the entire tumor where the first needle crosses.
Tighten your threads in four places, then incise the tumor in its middle until what is inside comes out. Cut off a piece of skin, and leave what remains tied, then apply a dressing soaked in a mixture of wine and oil. Then employ the treatment with wound dressings and ointments until it heals,
Chapter Fifty.
On tumors arising from nerve twisting.
Just as a tumor can appear in an artery or vein, so too can a tumor appear in a nerve if it is struck or fatigued excessively, particularly in the regions of the wrists and ankles.
And in every place where joints move, there can appear a soft tumor similar in color to the rest of the body; it is usually painless, but upon pressing it firmly, the patient may feel numbness like that caused by pressure. Such tumors are not localized deep within the body.
But such tumors are under the skin, moving in all directions except towards the front or back. Those located in joints should not be treated with iron, as it may cause bruising. Tumors in the head or forehead should also be avoided.
Then cut the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and excise it at its base. If it is large, suspend it with a hook, incise it, remove it, and close the wound with sutures. Treat until healed.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On the removal of moles appearing on the abdomen.
Many people have moles appearing on their bellies and other parts of the body, called "natural" ones because they resemble mushrooms. Their roots are thin, but their heads are thick; sometimes their lips turn inwards, and they can be small or large.
I have seen a man with moles on his belly resembling mushrooms, both white and thin at their base but with turned-in lips and cracked surfaces from which moisture constantly flowed. I removed them; one weighed about eighteen ounces, the other about six.
The procedure for removing it involves examining [the patient], and if the patient is moist and the color of the nevus is white, wet, and soft in origin, then cut it off with a broad scalpel. Have cauterizing irons ready nearby, for much blood often flows during its removal.
However, if blood overpowers you during its removal, cauterize it. If the patient is cowardly and fears being cut with iron, then take a strong iron thread and tie it around the nevus which has this description; leave it for two days, then tighten the iron thread further until it continues to tighten.
Whenever the thread tightens upon the nevus until it breaks off and falls by itself without pain. However, in cutting thick nevi, especially those on the abdomen, there may be some fear and difficulty; yet, it is possible to cut half or part of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent its return, then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of cutting a nevus that is dark-colored, insensitive to touch, and unsightly; for it is a cancerous tumor, which we will mention later.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On the treatment of pimples.
Pimples occur due to many causes, either from a rupture of the peritoneum on the abdomen causing hernias or from intestines as mentioned in other sections, or from blood flowing from a vein or artery as stated earlier, or from wind trapped therein.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and herniation, then the color of the tumor will resemble that of the body, it will be soft without pain, and its appearance will differ with changing positions. If it is due to herniation of the intestines, its appearance will differ greatly as described earlier. When pressed with fingers, it disappears then returns; there may be gurgling sounds and it becomes much larger during exertion or hot baths. If it is due to dampness, it will feel soft.
If it is not due to blood, when pressed with the hand it will not disappear or increase or decrease in size. If it is due to a fatty tumor, then it will be hard and solid, maintaining its original size.
If the pain has come from wind, then its touch is pleasant to us, and the treatment for this is: if you find that the source of the pain comes from blood in a vein or artery or wind, then it is advisable not to treat it, as there is fear and danger involved, as I informed you earlier in the chapter on tumors caused by veins and arteries.
If the pain comes from the bowels or bladder, you should order the patient to hold themselves upright while standing and then draw around the painful area with ink. Then order him to lie on his back between your hands, then make a wide incision around the painful area with a scalpel where you drew with ink, then insert a large probe into the center of the swelling upwards, and tightly bind the site of the incision with strong thread or silk suture.
Then tie the ligament like a noose, open it in the middle of the tense swelling above the ligament, insert your index finger into it, and seek the bowel. If the ligament has taken it, loosen the noose and push the bowel back into the abdomen. If you find a bladder, dilate it with a probe.
And cut its stalk, if an artery or vein obstructs you, ligate it properly and return to your task. Take two needles with strong threads attached, insert them into the incision around the swelling in a cross shape, then pull the swelling in four places using the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the site until the tense flesh rots and falls off on its own, or cut it if it softens and rots. Then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals, if the pain is from flesh that has grown there.
Or if it's from moisture, you should cauterize the swelling as mentioned earlier, then remove the blood or moisture found there and treat it with something that adheres to the site.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
In treating cancer.
We have mentioned in the section on classification the types of cancer and how to treat them with medications, and the warning against treating it with iron lest it cause ulcers. We have also mentioned cancer that occurs in the uterus and the warning against treating it.
Ancients have mentioned that when the cancer is in a place where it can be entirely removed, such as those in the breast or thigh and similar movable parts, it should be removed whole, especially if it is newly formed and small. However, if it has grown large, it should not be approached.
If I can heal anyone of it, let no one precede me to that, and the procedure is, if it is movable as mentioned, to proceed gradually removing the black spots one by one, then separate it if it is filled with blood vessels.
Then set up the patient on a stable platform where they can work, then apply forceps suitable for the tumor and push it from all sides along with the skin until nothing of its origin remains, letting the blood flow without cutting it hastily.
But squeeze the areas and remove all thick blood with your hand or whatever instruments are available. If great bleeding occurs during the operation due to cutting an artery or vein, tie the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Five.
In the treatment of Hemorrhoids.
It has been mentioned in the book of divisions about the types of dropsy, how water accumulates and the signs of each type and their treatment with drugs. Only the serous type is treated with iron; the lymphatic and fleshly types are not approached with it at all.
But if you have treated this serous type of hemorrhoids with drugs without success, look to see if the patient has become excessively weak or if there is another disease besides hemorrhoids present.
If there is coughing or diarrhea and such, do not treat him with iron; it is deceptive. If you find the patient strong without other diseases besides hemorrhoids, nor a child nor an old man, then proceed by having the patient stand facing you. Have a servant behind him press his abdomen with both hands and direct the water towards the pubic area, then take a hooked lancet of this shape:
Of the two sides, it is long and specified at its tip like a scalpel, except that it has some curvature which prevents it from reaching the intestines during operation, lest it harm them. Then observe if pus comes from the side of the intestine.
It is necessary to move the incision away from the navel three fingers downwards, accompanied by the pubic area. If the abscess originates from liver disease, make your incision three fingers to the left of the navel; if it originates from spleen disease, make the incision three fingers on the right side.
And it is not permissible for the incision to be on the side where the patient wants to lie down, lest pus flow towards that weak area. Then pierce the skin completely with the instrument and enter it into the incision while raising your hand.
With the scalpel, make an incision between the skin and peritoneum as if you are peeling it off, with a depth equal to that of a fingernail or similar. Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space – the space of the water [abdominal cavity] – then remove it and insert the instrument having this shape.
And it resembles a thin tube made of silver, copper, or polished brass with a small hole at its bottom and three holes on its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you can see.
And place its tip bare like this pen shape:
And at its upper end, there is a ring. When the instrument reaches the abdominal cavity [water], it will drop from its side onto the instrument, allowing for moderate drainage of fluid, lest too much fluid be drained causing animal spirit to dissolve and possibly leading to the patient's death.
Or it may cause him to fall into a swoon close to death, but drain only according to his strength and the patient's condition as indicated by his pulse strength and color. Then remove the instrument and collect the fluid, for it will be retained from its side.
Due to the skin that holds the hole on the peritoneum which I told you to plug with this stuff, then reuse the instrument another day if you find the patient improving.
And a little water should also be expelled, doing so gradually, while you are on the neck [of the patient], and taking care not to leave too much water remaining, for if you fear for the life of the sick person and leave an excessive amount of water, treat him by burying him in hot sand.
And there should be much sweating in the bathhouse and sun, making him thirsty, and treating him with dried drugs until he recovers. He should also be cauterized on the stomach, liver, and spleen after expelling water as previously described.
Chapter Fifty-Five
In treating infants born with incomplete or too narrow urinary openings, or those located incorrectly.
Some boys may be born from their mother's womb and birth canal without being perforated; in such case, it is expedient to perform the operation immediately after birth.
With a very fine probe like this:
Then insert a thin brass wire into the hole, tie it and hold it for three or four days. When urination is desired, pull it away, then return it; but if you do not use brass, it may be that urine which flows over the place will cause it to close.
And as for those with narrow openings, treat them with brass as mentioned previously for many days until it becomes wide. And those whose opening is located incorrectly - such as some who are born with the opening at the end of the urethra, unable to urinate forward.
Until he can lift his penis with his hand upwards, and until puberty when he will not be able to reach the womb directly - this is a very severe condition. The procedure for this is for the patient to lie on their back.
Then stretch the urethra with your left hand very firmly, and make an incision at the tip of the penis using a scalpel or sharp probe like a pen tip so that it resembles a urethral opening in its center.
And beware of causing bleeding during your procedure, for it often occurs. Counteract it by whatever stops the blood flow and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Five
In the case of a boil that appears on the eyelid, eyelash, and blackness and corruption with adhesion of the eyelid to the eye.
Often this boil appears on the urethra and is like a hard swelling; it can be malignant or benign. The benign one should be tied with a fine ligature.
And cut it until it is completely cleaned, then apply a bandage soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it with eagle's ointment until it heals. But if the boil is malignant and dark-colored, cauterize it after cutting and cleaning it.
But if the boil is on an uncircumcised foreskin and some of it is inside the foreskin and some is outside, first remove the part that is inside until it heals, then treat the one from outside.
For if you treat both at the same time, you may not avoid puncturing the foreskin. It also appears in women and in men with blackness and corruption which should all be cauterized to prevent further spreading or worsening.
Then apply honey mixed with ground pomegranate peels and dates, then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cautery with a crescent-shaped spoon like this:
Cautery is beneficial in both cases, i.e., bleeding and wound infection. If the eyelash falls out completely at any time, do not insert a lead tube into the urethra for the patient to urinate through. As for adhesion of the eyelid to the eye.
This adhesion occurs only in those who have a normal foreskin and have not been circumcised. It may be due to an injury or swelling. Use a blunt knife to scrape it off until the bond dissolves and the eye is freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish between the eyelid and foreskin on close examination, scrape off a little from each. The foreskin is thin so it may easily tear due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin and eyelid using a wet cotton cloth soaked in cold water to prevent adhesion again.
Then he treats with an astringent drink until it heels.
Chapter Seventy-Five
In the purification of infants and treating them for any afflictions they may face.
Circumcision is nothing but separating contact like other surgeries except that since it is done by us willingly and for the sake of children especially, we must perform it in the best manner.
The easiest way leading to safety is, as I say, the ancient authorities did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced among them; rather, it is something that we have acquired.
By experience, for I have found the majority of craftsmen and barbers practicing circumcision with Moses' tool and scissors, using the bandage and tying with thread and cutting with fingernail, having tried all these methods.
I did not find better than using scissors for the cutting and tying with thread because the use of Moses' tool often results in damaging the skin since the foreskin has two layers, so sometimes only the upper layer is cut while the lower one remains.
Therefore, one is forced to cut again and endure more pain, and the use of the file does not ensure that the tip of the urethra will not be cut because it may enter into its hole, while cutting with fingernail might cause skin to slip and spoil your work or perhaps the child's foreskin was naturally short.
Therefore, many are born that way and do not require circumcision, as I have seen, but the experience has shown me the superiority of using scissors and tying with thread because the blade above is equal to the blade below.
So when you press your hand with both blades together, cutting evenly and at once, the thread becomes like a wall surrounding the urethra from all sides without any error happening, and the first step of the procedure is to calm the child.
Especially if the child is one of those who understand little, so that you may reassure him by explaining to him that you will only tie a thread around his urethra today and leave it until another day, then release it and stroke him gently in any way he accepts, then make him stand before you upright.
Let him not be seated and hide the scissors in his sleeve or underfoot, so that the boy's eyes do not fall upon them at all, nor on any of the instruments. Then insert your hand into his anus and inflate the skin and draw it upwards until the head of the anus appears.
Then clean it from whatever filth may be found in it. Then bind the known place with a doubled thread. Then bind a little below it with another bandage. Then grasp the lower binding firmly with your thumb and index finger, and cut between the bindings. Then lift the skin upwards quickly and bring out the head of the anus. Then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and causes less swelling. Then wipe it with a moist cloth, then sprinkle on it some powdered dried colocynth, which is the best I have tried, or fine barley flour, which is also good.
Then lift the skin upwards quickly and bring out the head of the anus. Then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and causes less swelling. Then wipe it with a moist cloth, then sprinkle on it some powdered dried colocynth, which is the best I have tried, or fine barley flour, which is also good. Then apply a poultice from above in a cloth, consisting of a boiled egg crushed with rose water and fresh fragrant rose oil. Leave it on overnight, then treat him with other remedies until he recovers.
This is the shape of the scissors suitable for cauterization:
The scissors should be thin and sharp, without any twist in the screw. The length of the blades should be equal to the length of the handles. As for those who err in cauterization, they may sometimes cut all or part of the inner skin when cutting, so it is necessary to extend it with your thumb before the place swells.
Cut it horizontally. If you cannot hold it with your thumb, use forceps and cut it. If three days pass and the swelling and heat under the head of the anus persists, leave it until the inflammation subsides, then remove its slough gently.
Cut it according to what is convenient for you, but beware of the head of the anus. If something from the head of the anus is cut off, it does not matter. Then treat it with whatever poultices heal wounds, as described in the chapter on poultices.
If the skin above the wound is cut and draws upward, this too does not cause much harm; treat it with what was mentioned until it heals.
The Fifty-Eighth Chapter
In treating retained urine in the bladder.
If retained urine in the bladder occurs due to obstruction by a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or flesh growth and similar conditions, treat it with the methods of treatment mentioned in the previous sections.
And if the urine does not flow, and you find that its retention is due to a stone stuck in the neck of the bladder, then have the patient kneel with their buttocks raised. Then have another person sit on their back, pressing the abdomen towards the back, while the patient holds themselves steady as much as possible.
At this point, the neck of the bladder will push the stone backwards and urine will flow. If it does not flow with what was mentioned, and the condition becomes severe for the patient, then use the instrument called a 'qathathir' to remove it, which looks like this:
It is made of silver and thin, smooth and flexible like the tube of a bird's feather in its gentle slope. It is about one and a half spans long and has a slight funnel at its tip. To use it for drawing urine, take a doubled thread and tie a piece of sponge or cotton to its end securely.
Insert the tip of the thread into the bottom of the qathathir, then cut off any excess sponge with scissors so that it fits snugly inside like a cork. Then grease the qathathir with oil, foam, or egg white and have the patient sit on a chair.
Then expose the patient's urethra and anoint it with moistened cotton, oil, or warm water. Then gently insert the qathathir into the urethra until it reaches the neck of the bladder. Then bend the urethra upwards towards the scrotum and push the qathathir further inside.
Until the urethra is bent, then push the qathathir further inside until it reaches near the bladder. Then tilt the penis downwards and push the qathathir until the patient feels that it has reached an empty space.
It is done in this manner because the passage through which urine flows is bent, then the thread is inserted into the catheter with some force; for urine follows the catheter upon its removal, and water flows out.
Continue until the bladder empties and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to inject the bladder with sitz bath.
And images of the instruments suitable for this purpose are made of silver or ivory, having a long, flexible tube and an opening at the end through which water and medications can be infused. Such an instrument is called the 'sitz bath'.
It is made of silver or ivory, with a long tube that bends gently, all of it hollow except for one end which is sealed with three holes on one side and one hole on the other.
And the hollow space into which the catheter is inserted should fit snugly without any excess so that when it is pulled, moisture will be drawn in, and when it is pushed, liquid will be expelled just like how a siphon works to throw oil onto naval battles.
If you wish to expel moisture into the bladder, insert the tip of the sitz bath into the moisture and pull the catheter upwards; the moisture will be drawn into the hollow space of the sitz bath, then its tip will enter the urethra as described for catheters, and then push the moisture with the catheter.
For that liquid reaches the bladder immediately so that the patient feels it, and this is an image of a fine syringe used for bladder irrigation:
It is made of silver or brass, with its upper end resembling a small funnel and having a groove underneath for the ribbon. Then take a camel's bladder and fill it with the liquid you wish to irrigate the bladder with, then tie it tightly between the grooves using a double thread.
Warm the liquid slightly over a fire, then insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra and squeeze the camel's bladder gently with your hand until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.
If your bladder does not pass, take a piece of linen, make a circle from it, and pierce it on all sides. Then insert a thin thread through that hole as you would wind it. Gather the circle like a sieve after you have placed in it whatever liquids, oils, or waters you desire.
Then tie it to the device and use it as you would squeeze your bladder with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder,
Chapter Sixty.
In the removal of stones.
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stones and their treatment with drugs, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, and all its signs. And we have mentioned stones that require manual extraction and cutting.
And this is a specific stone formed in the bladder, which lodges in the urethra; I will describe it clearly and concisely.
I say that stones formed in the bladder are more common among children, and one of its signs is that urine comes out of the bladder like water in its smoothness.
And in it sand appears and the penis is irritated and troubled by it, and it often prolapses then retracts. The anus also protrudes in many cases. It is easy for boys to pass stones until they reach fourteen years of age, but difficult for the elderly. For youths, it is moderate between these extremes.
And the larger the stones are, the easier their treatment. Conversely, small stones are more difficult to treat. So when we begin treatment, it is necessary first to administer an enema to remove all the feces in the rectum, as it may obstruct the passage of the stone during examination.
Then take the patient by both legs, shake and drop him downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or have him jump from a high place repeatedly. Then sit him down in front of you with his legs spread and hands under his thighs so that the bladder is entirely tilted downwards. Then examine him.
Feel him from the outside. If you feel the stone in the passage, hasten to cut it open immediately, for if it does not come out at once, do not attempt to push your left index finger into him with oil if he is a boy or middle finger.
If the boy is fully grown, insert your hand into his seat and search for the stone until you feel it under your finger. Move it slightly towards the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the spot where you intend to cut.
And orders a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and orders another servant to stretch out his right hand with the scissors towards above, and with his other hand he stretches the skin that is below the scissors towards the place where the incision will be made. Then you take the cutting knife which has this shape:
And cut between the anus and the scrotum, not in the middle but towards the left side of the testicle. The incision should be directly over the stone, with your finger pressing the bladder outward so that the outside of the incision is wide and the inside is narrow enough for the stone to exit.
But if it is large, perhaps pressing the finger in the bladder will squeeze out the stone at the incision without difficulty. Know that some stones have angles and projections which may make their exit difficult.
And some are smooth like pebbles and round, making their exit easy. But if any have angles or projections, increase the incision slightly. If it still does not come out this way, do not hesitate to grasp it with forceps whose tip is like a probe.
So that it grips the stone securely and does not escape. Or else insert a fine, bent instrument underneath it. If you cannot manage it this way, widen the incision slightly. If something obstructs your view with blood, cauterize it with nitrate of silver.
If there are more than one stone, first push the largest towards the mouth of the bladder, then make an incision on it. Then do the same for the smaller ones. If they are extremely large, it is not permissible to make a big incision because it exposes the patient to two dangers.
Either he dies or he suffers from eternal incontinence because the wound will never close. But try to push it until it comes out, or break it with forceps and remove it in pieces.
If you have finished treating the wound, apply plaster and bandage it tightly. Then make a poultice moistened with oil or wine or rosewater and cold water to cool the hot swelling. After that, let the patient lie on his back without removing the bandage for three days.
When the wound opens, rinse it with plenty of water and oil. Then treat it with the bee honey poultice and the leek paste until it heals. If inflammation, heat, swelling or similar occurs, such as blood freezing in the bladder preventing urine from being expelled, which can be recognized by blood appearing in the urine...
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains it will cause the bladder to decay and become infected. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply whatever treatment is appropriate until it heals.
It is necessary during all stages of treatment to bind the thighs together to secure the drugs placed on the wound. If the calculus is small and has entered the urethra and stuck there preventing urine from being expelled, treat it with what I describe before it reaches the scrotum.
I have often resorted to this treatment instead of incision, as I have tried it and it appears thus:
Take an iron forceps with sharp points attached to a stick. Then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the calculus to prevent it from returning to the bladder. Next, gently insert the forceps into the urethra until it reaches the calculus.
Rotate the forceps with your hand on the calculus gently until it pierces through to the other side. Then release your grip, and the remaining part of the calculus will crumble and come out with the urine, healing the patient.
But if this method is not feasible due to some hindrance, tie a thread below the calculus and another above it. Then make an incision on the calculus in the penis between the two threads, and remove it.
Then the ligature is released and the clotted blood that has accumulated in the wound is cleaned. The first ligature must be tied underneath the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the second ligature should be tied above it so that when the thread is untied after the stone's removal, the skin will return to its original position covering the wound.
Therefore, when tying the upper ligature, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns to its original position and covers the wound as mentioned.
Chapter Sixty-One
In the Removal of Stones for Women
It is rare for women to have stones. If one of them has a stone, its treatment is difficult and many reasons prevent it, among which are: the woman may be a virgin, or you may not find a woman who allows herself to be examined by the physician.
If she is a virgin or from those protected [by laws of modesty], the third reason is that you may not find a woman skilled in this procedure, especially when it comes to manual work; and the fourth reason is that the location of the incision for women is far from the location of the stone, so an additional incision may be needed.
There is danger in this, for if necessity requires it, a skilled female physician should be taken, but they are rarely found. If not, then seek a virtuous male physician or arrange for a skilled midwife knowledgeable about women's matters or a woman who knows something of this craft to assist.
Bring her and command her to perform all that you order regarding the examination of the stone first, namely to look if the woman is a virgin. If she is, do not insert your finger into her vagina and search for the stone. If it is found and pressed beneath her finger
Then command her to make the incision on her. If she is not a virgin but has given birth, order the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.
If she finds the stone, she should gently draw it away from the mouth of the bladder downwards as far as her strength allows until it reaches the root of the thigh. Then she should make an incision on her opposite to half of the vulva at the root of the thigh, whichever side is convenient and where she feels the stone.
And her finger does not leave the stone, chewing beneath it. Let the incision be small at first, then introduce the hook into that small incision. If she feels the stone, increase the size of the incision according to what you know [to be] sufficient for the stone's exit. Know that types of stones are many.
And they are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, with branches. Know their kinds so that you may distinguish among them according to what you desire. If bleeding overwhelms you, sprinkle powdered ginger on the place and hold it there until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out, and count for yourself the instruments mentioned for extracting male stones to help you in your work. If bleeding overpowers you and you know that it is from a severed artery, place the cautery on the spot.
And tie it with forceps tightly but gently, leave it without returning to it and leave the stone alone. Perhaps the living thing will perish. Then treat the wound, until after days the intensity of bleeding subsides and the place becomes inflamed, then return to your work until the stone comes out.
Chapter Two-Sixty.
Regarding the incision on the water-intake duct.
The water-intake duct is essentially the gathering of moisture in the white bladder located beneath the skin that surrounds the testicle, known as the scrotum. Sometimes it has a special sheath prepared by nature on one side of the testis.
So that it is thought to be another testis, and it will be between the skin of the scrotum and the white bladder which we mentioned. This only happens rarely, and this duct is produced from weakness exposed to the intestines, so this matter adheres to it, having been exposed to a blow on the intestines.
And this moisture has many colors: sometimes it is yellowish, sometimes bloody red, sometimes dark black, but most commonly it is white. The signs by which it is known are:
Where water collects, if it is in the white bladder mentioned earlier, the tumor will appear round and somewhat elongated like an egg shape. The testis will not be visible because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If moisture is present in its membrane, the tumor will appear round on one side of the ovary.
Therefore, a person may believe it to be another egg. But if the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the white sac, it can be felt. And to know the color of the moisture, press the tumor with the square forceps whose image you have seen, and judge by what comes out.
When we proceed to treatment with iron, it is not permissible for the patient to perform bloodletting if he is able. Instead, observe his body and ensure it is full before he lies on his back on a slightly elevated surface, with many cloths placed beneath him. Then you sit at his left side.
Order a servant to sit on his right side, extend the penis towards one side of the scrotal skin, and towards the navel. Then take a wide scalpel and cut the scrotal skin lengthwise from the middle, almost reaching the pubic bone.
Make the cut straight and parallel to the line that divides the scrotal skin in half until it reaches the white sac. Then carefully strip the skin without damaging it, making sure not to cut too deeply on the side attached to the testicle.
Then widen the opening of the water-filled sac and remove all the water. Then separate the edges of the cut with forceps, extend the sac upwards without touching the tunic covering the testicles, and cut it as much as possible either entirely or in pieces.
But especially its thin side, for if you do not cut it completely, water may return. If the testicle comes out during this process, push it back in place. Once finished with cutting the sac, sew up the edges of the scrotal skin.
Then treat him like any other surgical patient until he recovers. If you find the testicle damaged by another disease, do not tie off its vessels for fear of bleeding. Then cut the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat as mentioned.
If both sides are filled with water, know that they are inflamed; therefore, operate on the other side as you did on the first, even if it seems to you that one operation is sufficient. Then wipe away the blood.
Insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil, and from outside apply another wool soaked in honey and oil; spread it over the testes and abdomen. Then place a folded cloth on top, which is the bandage. And bind it with the six-sided bandage as follows:
Then take two cloths, stitch them together and stuff with loose wool as an example. Make the ties from cotton or damp wool and gather them into a belt around the waist, one tie extending to the back.
And the second takes towards the pubic area, with ties on both thighs from below and the remaining two on the buttocks. All ties should be gathered into a waist belt; this bandage can also be made of linen instead of cutting with an iron.
It is also necessary to take a soft cautery iron and make an incision in the scrotum, as we have described, until the white fascia containing the water appears. Then use another cautery iron of this shape:
It resembles the Greek eye, then press it onto that fascia until all moisture is expelled. Then spread out the fascia with tweezers and scrape off its outer layer with the cautery iron, cutting it as much as possible until all of it is removed, taking care not to burn the testicle.
Know that this procedure is safer and more distant from bleeding than cutting, and better than cauterization. If any obstacle occurs during the operation such as hemorrhage or other complications, treat it according to what has been mentioned earlier.
If the patient is fearful and cannot endure this operation due to its harshness, then use the cautery iron as I have described, if it agrees with the signs mentioned earlier.
That the bandage is moist, therefore do not make the patient sit on a high chair. Then press the swelling from below with a wide spatula and keep it along the body; let the opening be wide enough for all water to flow out. Then place cotton on the site and bind it.
Leave it to absorb the rest of the water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water continues to flow out while pressing on it, this is because the white membrane blocks the mouth of the wound and prevents the water from flowing out.
Then, insert into the wound a goose feather or the instrument used for drawing off water from the beloved ones, whose image you have seen earlier, or slightly increase the opening of the wound.
And know that water may return and gather after six months or so. If it does gather, press on it in the same manner as before, and prolong the treatment until it heals completely.
Chapter Sixty-Three
On Fissures of the Gluteal Muscle and Their Treatment
Know that a fissure on this muscle is one of the gravest matters, leading to destruction in most cases. Therefore, we see leaving it alone and refraining from operating on it; however, I mention its treatment and types of tumors here.
I say that many tumors can occur in the bodies where there is a composition of anthrax, and this may happen due to various causes such as excessive heat collecting at the anthrax, or from an injury. The color of the tumor will be like the natural skin color without any fluid present.
The tumor may be hard, and it might be congested with a purple color without any sensation. It could also result from the dilation of blood vessels and their swelling, as mentioned earlier, or from the swelling of veins. If it is due to the swelling of arteries, then the tumor will disappear once pressed upon.
If the tumor disappears when pressed with your fingers, then it is not due to vein swelling. However, if no change occurs upon pressing with fingers, then it is likely caused by vein dilation and may cause pain in the muscle and other flesh tissues.
To perform the procedure, first incise the skin of the scrotum. Then carefully push the testis upwards and out of the white tunic (tunica albuginea), freeing it from its blood vessels. Tie off the blood vessels and cut the testis away from all sides if it has adhered to neighboring tissues.
It is not necessary to remove the testis completely and cut it. However, if there is any adhesion between the tunics or between the blood vessels, all adherent tissues should be carefully freed and removed with a round excision.
If the inflammation of flesh is at the point of adhesion, which is behind it, all of it should be cut off and the egg removed as previously mentioned. Once your work is done, wash the wound with wool dampened in rose oil and water, then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
The Forty-Second Chapter
In treating an ulcer accompanied by a prolapse.
The prolapse is a tortuous tumor resembling a cluster, with relaxation of the anus and difficulty in movement and exercise. The treatment for this condition is close to what has been mentioned earlier.
But it is necessary to mention the procedure in this case as done by the ancients, so I say that the patient should sit on a high chair and push down the anal cushion. Then grasp the scrotum skin along with the nearby vessels near the penis.
A helper should hold it and stretch it forcefully. Then make a curved incision next to the vessels with a broad, sharp scalpel until the vessels are exposed. Then peel off the skin from all sides as mentioned earlier in the case of arteries in the legs. Then insert a needle with a double thread into it.
Tie it first at the points where the prolapse is present and also at its end. Then make a vertical incision in the middle along the body and remove the accumulated dirty, foul secretions.
Then treat the wound as other wounds that you want to heal within a certain period so that the blood vessels nourishing one of the testicles do not fall off. But if the prolapse affects all the blood vessels, it is necessary to remove one of the testicles along with its blood vessels lest the egg die from lack of food. Before cutting the blood vessels, it will rot and there will be no benefit from it,
The Fifty-Second Chapter
In treating a prolapsed vein.
This prolapse occurs due to a hernia appearing in the posterior wall of the abdomen near the navel, causing the intestine to protrude into one of the scrotum.
This hernia occurs either from a fissure of the peritoneum or from its extension. These two types occur due to many causes, such as a blow, a jump, a cough, lifting a heavy object, etc. Its indication, if it is from the extension of the peritoneum, is that it appears gradually over a long period.
However, it does not occur suddenly and the tumor appears flat towards its depth because the peritoneum compresses the intestine. Its indication, if from a fissure of the peritoneum, is that severe pain occurs suddenly from the beginning, and the tumor appears different in appearance under the skin nearby.
And this is due to the exit of the intestine from the peritoneum, and its fate outside it. Sometimes the mesentery also exits, in which case this type of hernia is called an 'intestinal-umbilical' hernia. It may also contain gas, or fecal matter may accumulate there leading to the patient's death.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling, especially when pressed. However, the treatment for these types of diseases with iron is dangerous, so one should avoid it. The method of treatment is to order the patient to push the intestine back into its abdomen by hand if possible.
Then he lies on his back with his legs raised, and you stretch the skin above the scrotum. Then cut open the entire skin of the scrotum lengthwise, then insert probes into the wound according to what is needed to widen it.
The incision should be wide enough to allow the testicle to pass through. Then strip away the parietal peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin until the white, solid peritoneal sac is fully exposed on all sides. At this point, insert your index finger behind the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum beneath the tunica vaginalis and the second peritoneum, release the adhesion behind the testicle. Then insert your right hand into the scrotal skin, and with your left hand stretch the white peritoneum upwards and elevate the testicle towards the incision.
Order the assistant to pull the testicle up, then release all adhesions behind it completely. Then use your finger to check if there is any twisted intestine in the white peritoneum. If you find anything, push it down into the abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread made from ten strands and insert it through the end of the peritoneum beneath the skin near the incision, then cut off the bent ends of the thread so that there are four strands remaining. Then intertwine the threads together in a cross-stitch pattern and tie them firmly to the peritoneum we mentioned beneath the skin, on both sides. Then also wrap the thread ends and bind them tightly so that nothing can reach the vessels that nourish it. So that it does not cause inflammation and becomes a second tie outside the first, at least two fingers away. After these ties, leave about the width of a finger from the peritoneum beneath the skin.
So that it does not cause inflammation and becomes a second tie outside the first, at least two fingers away. After these ties, leave about the width of a finger from the peritoneum beneath the skin. Then cut off the rest in a circular fashion and remove the egg with it. Then make an incision beneath the skin at the base of the scrotum, allowing blood and pus to flow out as previously described. Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound and use the suture that was described.
And be careful to tie the white peritoneum that we mentioned after cutting it, to prevent bleeding which often occurs. Leave the stitch until it falls off by itself; if it is slow to fall off, then immerse it in hot water and support it until it falls off.
Then treat the wound as you would any other surgical wound until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six
In this case of rectal prolapse, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. The ancients mentioned that one should proceed as described for prolapses associated with a vaginal defect, namely tying the vessels gently after making an incision below them.
Then make an incision in the middle and treat the swelling to open it until the vessels fall out, then treat the wound as mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Seven
Regarding hernias that occur in the scrotum
A hernia may appear in the scrotum as mentioned, but it will not descend into the anus unless it is easy and returns at all times.
But if time has prolonged it, the gap in the scrotum may increase until the viscera and testicles descend into the scrotum, exposing that which was previously in the abdomen as we have mentioned. And this is because the peritoneum stretches out then relaxes and twists at its site, and its treatment is by cautery as I have already described its method.
And it can be treated with iron on this condition: the patient lies on his back before you, then cut the location of the inflamed hernia horizontally at a length of three fingers under the skin.
Until, when the white peritoneum is exposed, take a thread and place it on the emerging peritoneum and push it into the abdomen's depth, then sew up the two openings at the end of the thread with sutures and stick them together.
Then cut off the thread's end without cutting into the peritoneum at all nor touching the testicle nor anything else as I have informed you in treating hernial strangulation, then treat it like other surgical wounds.
If the sutures hold fast and the wound heals until it closes, then the peritoneum contracts and the hernia no longer prolapses.
And cautery is better in this case because it is closer to the vessels.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On Relaxation of the Penis Skin.
It often happens that the penis skin relaxes in some people without the inner flesh relaxing, making it ugly to look at. Therefore, whoever desires its treatment should lay the patient on his back.
And cut off all the relaxed skin from the thick skin, then bring together the lips [of the incision], and if you wish, first stitch the excess skin with three or four sutures to secure it, then cut between the sutures.
Then treat it like other surgical wounds until it heals and the sutures fall out,
Chapter Ninety-Six.
On Castration.
And castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, it is not fitting for me to include this in my book except that I mention it for two reasons: firstly, so that this knowledge may be available to the physician if he is asked about it, and secondly, because we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
The castration of beasts such as sheep, goats, cats and the like is of two kinds: either by cutting or by breaking and severing. That which is done by cutting is performed by sitting the animal in hot water until its female parts relax, soften, and droop.
Then milk it with your hand until it dissolves and cannot be felt. As for castration by cutting and severing, one should grip the animal and squeeze its scrotum with the left hand, then tie off the cords and make a single cut on each testicle.
Until the testicles appear, cut them off after peeling them. Leave nothing on them except the thin layer of membrane that is on the vessels. This method of castration is better than that done by cutting.
For cutting may leave some female parts behind, causing the animal to desire copulation. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On treating hermaphrodites.
There are two kinds of hermaphroditism in men: one appears externally or within the scrotum between the testicles, resembling a woman's vulva with hair and from which urine may flow.
And in women there is one kind, appearing above the vulva on the mons pubis like a small penis protruding externally, or two like female parts. Treatment for these three kinds:
The two kinds in men and the one kind in women should have the excess flesh cut away until its trace disappears, then treated like other wounds until it heals. As for the second kind in men that passes urine from within the scrotum, there is no treatment for it nor hope of recovery.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On cutting the clitoris and excess flesh protruding from women's vulvas.
The clitoris may be larger than normal, becoming prominent and unsightly, or in some women it may extend like a penis and lead to sexual desire.
It is necessary to grasp the clitoris with your hand or forceps and cut it off, taking care not to cut too deeply into its root lest bleeding occur.
Then treat it with surgical treatment until it heals; but the newly grown flesh is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And perhaps it may exit externally, like a hernia. Therefore some ancient authorities called it "the disease of the navel", and it is necessary to cut it off like the prepuce, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Two-Seventy
In treating fractures.
Rupture is when a woman's vulva is not torn or only slightly torn, and this can either be natural at birth or acquired due to some cause. The acquired type can be from superfluous flesh that has grown.
Or it may be due to a thin or thick membrane, located either within the uterus, on its sides, above or below. It prevents sexual intercourse and pregnancy, as well as childbirth, and may also prevent menstruation. The diagnosis is made by examination from the midwife.
If the obstruction is visible and close, then if it is not visible, search for it with your fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is a thin membrane and close to the labia minora, quickly cut it open by placing your thumb on either side of the labia minora.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread. She then stretches the labia minora forcefully until the thin membrane is torn open and the obstruction is opened. Then she takes some wool, soaks it in oil, and places it on the spot. The woman should have sexual intercourse every day to prevent the wound from sticking together again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, do not cut it with a wide scalpel like a leaf of almonds. If the obstruction is from superfluous flesh, attach forceps to it and cut it off. Have with you drugs that stop bleeding without cauterizing, such as gum arabic, henbane, and milk mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide brass tube to prevent the wound from closing quickly. Hold it in place for some days, then use dry cotton lint and treat it with other methods until it heals. If there is further flesh growth inside the uterus, do not cut it in this manner.
If it is not cancerous, then the cancerous tumor that occurs in the uterus should never be treated with iron.
The Thirty-Seventh Chapter
In treating hemorrhoids and warts, as well as red pimples that appear on the genitals of women
And hemorrhoids are a swelling of the veins until they bleed profusely continuously. When a hemorrhoid becomes prolapsed, it turns into a wart. We have mentioned its types and signs earlier.
And I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are inside the uterus and have not appeared externally, cannot be treated with iron. But those that appear at the mouth of the uterus can be treated.
It is necessary for a woman to enter a cold house, stretch the warts with a comb or rough cloth, and cut them off at their roots. Then she should apply one of the drugs that stops bleeding without causing inflammation.
Such as Quicklime, Silica, and Honey. Then she should raise her legs against the wall for a while before lowering them into cold water. If bleeding persists, sit her in a decoction of Rue seeds, pomegranate rinds, and fig leaves. Then take wheat flour, mix it with honey and vinegar.
And apply this mixture to her back. If bleeding stops, then stop applying it. Otherwise, continue applying it to the buttocks and breasts without restriction. Then take a piece of flaxseed, soak it in a decoction of thyme or coltsfoot leaves or fig leaves with fig syrup, and apply it to the affected area.
If the tumor subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for red pimples, they resemble the heads of lice and have a rough appearance. Do not cut what appears from them as mentioned earlier in the case of warts. Treat them until they heal.
The Fortieth-Seventh Chapter
On retention of menses in the uterus.
There are many types of tumors that can occur in the uterus, such as cancer, calcified tumors, ulcers, fistulas, erosions, warts, hemorrhoids, fissures, and hot tumors. All these diseases and their types and symptoms have been mentioned earlier.
It is necessary to mention in this chapter the hot tumor that appears in the womb, if it is one of those tumors that accumulate over time. If its pain at the beginning is sharp with pulsation and inflammation and fever.
When it is seen red and touched, do not rush to its cauterization. Treat it with what helps maturation until these symptoms subside. Then, when the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean on her back.
She should gather her legs towards the lower abdomen, keep her thighs apart, place her arms under her knees, and tie them with a suitable band.
So the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument that opens the mouth of the uterus, whose picture will come later. It is necessary to estimate gently the depth of the woman's uterus beforehand so that what enters from the instrument does not exceed its depth.
If the instrument hurts her, then if it exceeds the depth, it is necessary to place folds on the lip of the cervix to prevent the whole instrument from entering the uterus. The loop that runs in the instrument should be from the upper side.
And you hold the instrument, while the assistant turns the loop until the cervix opens. If the plug appears and is touched by hand and found to be thin, it should be cut at its tip with a wide scalpel. When all the period has been expelled.
It is necessary that a soft wick dipped in rose oil or green olive oil with some wax be placed in the wound. The wick should remain outside the incision in the cervix, and clean wool soaked in water boiled with henbane should be applied from outside on the uterus and pubis.
Then treat it after two days with the ointment suitable for that until it heals.
And the uterus and wound can be washed by injecting water and honey, then with water boiled with onion or long-leafed mint. Then return to the ointment, if the plug is hidden inside the uterus.
It is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron; rather treat it with what has been mentioned in the division.
Chapter Seventy-Five
In teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses if they are born abnormally.
A midwife should first know the form of natural birth, one of its signs being when she feels pressed downwards and desires to take a breath, and she finds relief from her labor pains.
If the fetus comes out quickly, know that this birth is in the natural form, with its head emerging first and the umbilical cord attached to it or hanging from its buttocks. If you see these signs, do not press her belly so that the baby may come out quickly.
However, if it comes out head-first, the placenta will also come out with it and be cleaned away nicely. Any other position is abnormal and condemned because the baby may come out feet-first or its hands may emerge before its head.
Or it may come out with one hand or foot first, or head and one hand, or emerge bent, perhaps upside down or in some other condemned position. Therefore, the midwife should be skilled and careful in all these matters and avoid mistakes.
And I have specified each of these positions and how to deal with them so that you may understand and rely on them. If the baby comes out head-first in the normal position, but the woman is having difficulty delivering it and her strength has weakened, seat her on a chair and summon some women to assist her.
And anoint her uterus with cooked fenugreek and damp cotton. Then the midwife should insert a small scalpel between her fingers and cut the umbilical cord, or use her nail to do so until its moisture flows out. Then press the woman's belly until the baby descends.
If it does not descend, then inject the woman with fenugreek juice mixed with deer tallow. Then tell her to push and use the candytuft plant to make her sneeze while holding her mouth and nose closed. If one of the baby's hands emerges first, gently pull them back a little.
If entry is not possible, place the woman on a pulpit and raise her legs above it. Then shake the pulpit gently while she holds on tightly to prevent falling during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus does not emerge, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie her hands with a cloth and pull gently until the fetus comes out, coming out feet-first. If the fetus comes out feet-first, do not push its legs upwards but turn it slightly until it becomes smooth. Then take one of its legs and stretch it slightly.
When it reaches the thighs, instruct her to cough and apply pressure with the forceps. If it does not come out as described, gently turn back the fetus until it returns to its natural position. It will then come out smoothly. If it still refuses to come out despite all these efforts.
Take some spittle of a dog and spittle of colocynth, ointment of wax and gum arabic dissolved together. Grind them all in a mortar until they become fine. Then apply it to the woman's vulva and below her abdomen before immersing her in warm water up to her navel.
When you see that her lower part has softened, make for her a suppository of myrrh and insert it. After some time has passed, seat her on a chair, make her sneeze, block her mouth and nose, and gently squeeze the lower part of her abdomen. The fetus will then come out from there, coming out on its knees and hands.
If it comes out in this manner, gently insert your hands to help its exit. Then have the woman lie on her back and let her buttocks hang down while she is lying on a bed. She should then hold her hands together before gently squeezing above her abdomen. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that her buttocks hang down. If the fetus does not come out, take both of her legs together and shake them vigorously. Then gently squeeze above her abdomen until the fetus moves upwards. Then the midwife should insert her hand and turn the fetus slightly to make it smooth.
And the woman's order is to be delivered until the fetus comes out, and the fetus came out resisting, attached to one of her hands. If she cannot return her hand, then make the woman sit and let her walk if she cannot walk, let her lie down.
He made her lie down and shook her legs strongly, then he used the linen cloth that was mentioned among the bandages. If the waters are broken, sit her up on a chair, then deal with returning the hand and aligning the fetus in its natural position, blow on the woman's face and order her to push until it comes out.
The fetus comes out on its back with hands outstretched and face towards the mother's back. The midwife should take hold of the baby's hand, turn it gently bit by bit until it stands upright. Then carry out what was mentioned earlier about applying the oil and bandages.
Then tell her to move slightly, if she does so, sit her up on the chair and instruct her to lean towards the right side. Then tell her to push and blow into her face with the bellows, then the fetus will come out upright on its side.
If it descended into the mouth of the womb like this with the placenta, cut the placenta with a needle until it is emptied of moisture. If it is stuck to the baby's face and neck, sever it from the source lest it suffocate and die. Then push the baby back inside so that it returns to its proper position.
Tell the woman to push several times until it comes out easily. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes even three or four survive, although this is rare. Five is against nature and none have ever survived.
Surround them with one placenta even if they are many, and they separate from each other by a partition attached to the source of each. They come out like a single fetus, or emerge abnormally as described.
If some are difficult to deliver and assume the shapes we mentioned that are not natural, treat them as described. Let the midwife be gentle, patient, and skilful in handling each case with whatever means necessary to ensure safety.
The fetus formations in the womb that are aborted can be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or more than ten. I have witnessed a woman aborting seven and another fifteen; all were formed.
By the Grace of the All-Wise, this knowledge belongs to the midwife, so perhaps she may encounter such a case someday and deal with it appropriately.
Chapter Seventy-Six.
In the delivery of a dead fetus.
If the dead fetus does not come out despite the treatment mentioned earlier, and you are forced to intervene manually, first examine [the woman] if she is strong and free from any signs of danger. Then, have her lie down on a bed on her back.
And let her head be tilted downward and her legs elevated, with a helper adjusting or tying them on both sides to prevent the body from shifting during the extraction.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with a wet sponge dipped in honey, myrrh, and linseed oil. The midwife should also wet her hand with these substances before inserting it gently into the womb to locate suitable places for applying forceps.
Look, if the fetus is presenting head-first, insert the forceps into its eyes, forehead, mouth, throat, or under its beard or buttocks, or in the areas near the ribs or under the armpits.
If the fetus is presenting feet-first, insert the forceps into the pubic area or the middle of the ribs. Hold the forceps with your right hand and wrap its curve around your left fingers. Insert your hand gently and apply the forceps to some of the mentioned places.
Continue until you reach an empty space, then insert another forceps opposite it or a third one if needed to ensure even traction and prevent tilting. Pull gently in a horizontal direction, not just straight but also move it from side to side.
When the fetus comes out like a cucumber through a bottleneck, ease the traction intermittently. If any part gets stuck, apply some oil to your fingers and insert them from that side to rotate the stuck part. Once some of the fetus has come out, move the forceps to other positions.
Raise it slightly and do this until the entire fetus emerges. If a hand comes out before the rest and cannot be pushed back due to its constriction, wrap a cloth around it and then pull it until all of it emerges.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow, and similarly you should do with the other hand and feet. If the fetus' head is large and there is pressure on it during delivery or if there is water collected in its head, then you should insert a hooked probe between the fingers.
And cut through the head with it to release the water or use the instrument called the 'Mashdak' whose image is shown along with other instruments in the following chapter.
Similarly, if the fetus has a large head, you should cut through the skull or break it with the 'Mashdak' as mentioned earlier, then remove the bones with forceps. If the head emerges but is constricted at the neck, cut until the fluid in the chest cavity settles.
If the chest joins at that point, if not, cut as much as possible. If the lower abdomen is warm or contains heat, you should cauterize it until fluid flows from it.
If the fetus is breech, its extraction and turning towards the mouth of the uterus are easy. If it becomes constricted at the abdomen or chest, then pull it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and cut through the abdomen or chest until their contents spill out.
After removing all the other parts and if the head returns and is obstructed, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If the mouth of the uterus is open, she should insert her hand into the cervix, seek out the head with her fingers, and pull it towards the mouth of the uterus using tweezers or two tweezers.
If the mouth of the uterus has joined due to a hot tumor and there is inflammation, do not be rough with it. Instead, use warm, moist compresses and apply poultices, then sit in warm water that softens and moisturizes.
As for if the fetus is lying on its side, if it can be turned then use what was mentioned regarding live fetuses. If not, cut and remove it. Do not leave any placenta inside at all. After completing your treatment, use what was mentioned about treating hot tumors in uteri.
If bleeding occurs, apply pressure to the water retention area and use other treatments. I once saw a woman who became pregnant but the fetus died inside her. Then she became pregnant again.
Then the other fetus also died. After a long time, she developed an abscess in her uterus which swelled and opened, discharging pus. I was called to treat her but despite prolonged treatment, the wound did not heal. Therefore, I applied some strong drawing ointment.
So a bone came out of the site, then after some days another one came out. I was amazed by this as the womb does not contain bones. I presumed they were from the dead fetus' skull and upon searching the wound, I found many small skull bones.
I continued this treatment until I removed many bones from her and the woman recovered well. She lived like that for some time with a small discharge from the site. This is the story I am presenting here.
For it contains knowledge and assistance to what a practicing physician aims to achieve by his hands in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
This chapter contains illustrations of the instruments needed for fetal extraction.
Image of a hook used to open the mouth of the uterus:
This speculum used for books should have hooks at both ends of its branches, but the hook should be smoother than the speculum itself. It should be made either from ivory or ebony wood and each branch should be as thick as two fingers.
And their shape should be like a finger, and their length one and a half cubits. In the middle of the branches there are two projections of the same wood, secured to them, with a length of half a cubit or slightly more, and a width of about two fingers or slightly more.
These are the ones that enter into the mouth of the uterus to open it when you use the hooks, illustration of another similar but lighter and thinner instrument:
It is made from ivory or ebony wood in the shape of forceps, except that it has two projections at its tip as you see. Each projection is about one cubit long and two fingers wide. If you wish to use it to open the uterus,
I seat the woman on a bed with her legs dangling, spread apart. Then I insert these two retractors into the mouth of the womb, and you grasp the end of the instrument between her thighs. Open your hand with the instrument as you would with forceps, to whatever degree you wish to open the womb. Until you make the midwife that you desire, an image of another spiral mentioned by the ancients:
A picture of the cannon used to expel the fetus:
Picture of the hook used to extract the head of the fetus:
It resembles scissors with teeth at one end, as you see. It can also be made square like forceps, as shown here; its teeth are like the teeth of a saw, used for cutting and tearing.
Picture of another cannon:
Picture of a hook:
This hook should be made slightly thick so it does not break when used to pull out the fetus. Picture of a double-pronged hook:
Picture of wide scissors for cutting the fetus:
The more types of these instruments you have prepared by your craftsman, the faster will be his work and the greater will be his reputation among people. Do not disdain any instrument that could be useful to you in a necessary situation.
Chapter Eighty-Seven.
In expelling the afterbirth.
If the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, you should order the woman to hold her breath, then plug her nostrils with a cloth and compress her mouth and nostrils with your hand. If it comes out this way, otherwise take this amount.
And make a hole in the cover and place in it open flowers of plants like fennel, coriander, thyme, basil, radish, garlic, and costus root; some or all of these drugs. Soak them with water and put them on the fire. Then place one end of a silver tube into the hole of the pot cover, and the other end into the mouth of the womb.
And hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then plug as mentioned earlier. If the afterbirth comes out quickly; otherwise order the midwife to dip her left hand in oil of storax or ass's saliva.
Then insert it into the vulva and search for the placenta with it. If you find it, grasp it and gently pull it little by little until it comes out. If it is attached deep in the uterus, insert your hand as we have described until you find the placenta. Then gently tug it out little by little with care.
Lest the uterus fall out due to excessive pulling, it is preferable to gently move it towards the sides, left and right, then increase the amount of pull gradually. It will then come out and detach itself. If the mouth of the uterus is closed, we have described its treatment with fumigation and treatment for difficult births and obstructed labors.
If it does not come out despite all that has been described, do not resort to violence in pulling again. Instead, tie what has come out to the mouth of the uterus using a band around the woman's thigh. Then apply the four-ingredient ointment, as it causes decomposition after several days.
And it dissolves and comes out until, when it decomposes, a foul smell rises to the stomach and head causing harm to the woman. Therefore, do not use the suitable poultice.
Therefore, some early practitioners have tried poultices of fenugreek and dried figs, using the apparatus depicted for vaporizing women during menstrual obstruction and retained placenta etc.:
It is made of brass or copper, resembling a funnel. The narrow end is placed in the vulva while the wide end is placed on fire with incense burning on coals. Hold it until the incense finishes and then repeat with more incense.
Chapter Ninety-Seven
In treating an unperforated anus.
Many boys are born with an unperforated anus that is blocked by a thin membrane of peritoneum. The midwife should not pierce this membrane with her finger, but rather use a sharp probe to gently break through it without touching the muscle.
Then place a sponge soaked in honey and oil on it, treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear that it may close again, insert a lead tube into the hole for many days and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
Sadd al-miq'adah may also appear due to the fusion of a wound or tumor. It should be cut open, then treated with what has been mentioned regarding treatment and suturing.
The Eightieth Chapter.
In treating hernias that occur in the lower region.
Hernias that occur in the lower region are a complex and hard growth near the anus from outside or within one of its sides, with one or more hernias present.
If that growth is left untreated, it opens up and discharges a watery, white fluid or thin pus. Some of these hernias may extend into the bladder or rectum, while others may not. The prolapsed ones can be identified by the passage of feces or wind during defecation.
And sometimes worms may emerge from them. Some hernias, if they are in the scrotum and prolapsed into the bladder or urethra, may also prolapse into the groin or perineum. Those prolapsed to the anus can be recognized even without prolapse.
Insert your index finger into the anus and introduce a thin probe made of copper or iron into the hernia if there is no strangulation. If there is strangulation, use a thin probe made of lead or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair with your finger. If you do not feel it at all and nothing comes out of the hole, neither feces nor wind nor worms as mentioned earlier, know that it is not prolapsed; therefore, proceed to treatment.
If the hernia is prolapsed into the bladder or urethra, its diagnosis is indicated by the passage of urine from it and its failure to adhere to drugs. If it has prolapsed into the groin or perineum, its location can be determined by the introduction of the probe there.
If it is not strangulated to the bone, if there is pain on one side, if it constantly discharges pus, and if treatment does not help nor can it be adhered with ointment - all prolapsed ones are like this - then there is no cure for them.
The treatment for it is futile, for those who attempt to perform cupping on it among the ignorant physicians. But as for those that are not severe and not chronic, healing can be hoped for with iron [scalpel], as I shall describe and have experienced.
Then he spreads his legs towards the thighs, inclining them towards his belly. Then insert the copper or lead probe into the navel until you feel it reach the bladder. If the patient feels it near the bladder, do not insert your index finger into the bladder.
If you feel the probe has passed itself openly, without sensing any tissue or flesh between your finger and it, then know certainly that it is perforated. In such a case, do not tire yourself with it, for there will be no healing.
It has been said that some people are cured by it [cupping] in rare cases. One of the treatments hoped to be beneficial is: heat a thin iron on coals according to the width of the navel, wrap it in rags and insert it into the navel until it reaches near the bladder, then repeat this two or three times.
Until you know that all the excess flesh around it, resembling a chicken feather pipe, has been burned. Then treat him by twisting cotton wool soaked in oil until the burned flesh comes out, then treat him with cauterizing ointments.
If not, he will never recover except by other treatments. But if you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger in the bladder, with a thick layer of flesh or peritoneum between them, and you see the navel is on the surface of the skin, then cut through the skin from the beginning of the navel. You cut through the flesh with the probe still in the navel until you reach where the tip of the probe ended, then remove the probe and it falls out. Then cleanse that excess flesh resembling a chicken feather pipe so that none remains.
Then treat him with cauterizing ointments until he recovers. But if blood overpowers you and hinders your work of cutting that flesh, the best and quickest way is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp drug, for cauterization by fire combines two benefits: burning the excess flesh.
Cut the blood and dry up the dampness, then treat it with a linen bandage moistened in sesame oil or ground sulfur mixed with oil until it secretes. Remove those burned flesh from the secretion. Then treat the wound with adhesive ointments that cause flesh to adhere.
And these are the remedies that cause constriction and drying. If they harden, then it has healed and no more return is required. But if the wound has reached deep into the abdomen and is distant from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the abdomen and search with it.
If you feel the bladder and there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh between it and you, and it is close to the urethra, then nothing should be done except by trial and hope. One of three methods may be used for this purpose.
Or, you may cut it until you reach its bottom so that you can introduce a bandage and treat it from near without cutting too deep lest you sever the muscle surrounding the bladder, causing involuntary discharge of feces. Then treat it as mentioned before; perhaps it will heal.
Or, you may perforate that barrier and pierce it after cutting near the bladder as mentioned before, either with the probe or with another sharp instrument. Then clean all the necrotic flesh in the incision as much as you can.
Then wait for the wound, including the incision and upper mouth, to heal until it closes while keeping the urethra open inside the bladder. This will be easier for the patient, although the urethra may become dilated in this way.
If the probe is inserted into the urethra and enters one side of the bladder towards its surface near the skin, then take a probe like an awl with a sharp tip in this shape:
And thread it with a cord made of five threads or similar, then insert the probe with the thread into the urethra until it reaches its bottom. If it is dilated near the edge of the bladder inside.
Then pull the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the bladder and pulling one end of the thread, gathering both ends together and tying them tightly. Leave it for a day or two; every time the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues between the two ends of the thread break off and fall away. Then treat the wound until it heals.
If the nostril of the patient is not dilated, dilate it as much as possible without going too deep lest you cut the muscle. Then proceed as described until it heals.
A sharp-pointed trocar for piercing nostrils should have its tip very sharp, while the other end is not sharpened to avoid unnecessary cuts as shown.
Chapter Eighty-One.
In the case of a hemorrhagic anal fissure, its cutting and treatment of prolapse.
Fissures may appear in two forms: either they are inside the anus, resembling pomegranate seeds, or like grapes, ranging from small to large with continuous bleeding.
Some fissures are single, others are numerous; some are external while the majority are internal. However, those that occur outside the anus are usually dry and secrete a small amount of yellow fluid or blood intermittently, appearing similar in color to the skin.
To treat internal fissures, instruct the patient to evacuate the bowels and cleanse the area until the fissure appears. Then quickly grasp it with forceps or pinch it between your fingers and cut it at its base.
Remove it using a rough cloth or a piece of coarse linen, or grasp it with your fingers and cut it. Then sprinkle some sharp powder on the wound to serve as cautery.
Then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If the bowels do not evacuate easily, inject the patient with a small amount of warm water to wash out its contents and facilitate evacuation. External fissures are easier to manage.
It is preferable to grasp it with your fingers or use forceps and cut it, then treat it as mentioned until it heals. If cutting with iron is disliked, use a threaded needle instead.
Then pull the hemorrhoid upward, insert the needle into its base from the other side, wrap the threaded ends of the needle underneath it and tighten them. Tie the thread and remove the needle. Repeat this process for all hemorrhoids except one.
To bleed it, then place on the pubic region a cloth soaked in rose or jasmine oil and leave it until it falls. When it falls, treat it with ointments and other remedies until it heals.
As for the treatment of fissures, often they are treated with poultices made from beans and with constipation remedies. If it does not improve after a while, one should scrape it with a razor or pumice stone until it becomes moist and the outer layers that prevent healing fall off.
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, scrape it again more harshly until it bleeds well and peels off, then treat it and it will heal.
The Second Eighty-Ninth Chapter
On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted splinters, dry warts, and moles.
A splinter is a round knot resembling the head of a nail in color, appearing on the body, especially at the soles of the feet and toes. It causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to cut around the splinter, grasp it with tweezers or a forceps and remove it from its root. Then treat it. If you wish, cauterize it as mentioned earlier in this chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, thickened, round protrusion on the surface of the body.
Dry warts often appear on children's hands. Their treatment involves stretching thewart and cutting it off or removing it with a silk thread or hair. If you wish, cauterize it with fire or use a strong medicine.
Both inverted and non-inverted warts can be removed using the instrument mentioned earlier for treating moles. As for a mole, it is also a small, thickened, rounded protrusion on the surface of the body that goes deep into the skin. If it gets cold, one feels a sensation similar to that of an ant bite.
Moles are found on the entire body, but more commonly on the hands. Their treatment involves taking a quill from an ostrich or eagle feather and making it into a tube around the mole so that it encircles its edges. Then rotate your hand with the tube to cut around the mole.
And make it penetrate deep into the flesh and dislodge the ant from its source, and if you wish, you may do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:
The upper end of the tube should be sealed and hollowed out to facilitate grasping and turning it with the fingers. And if you wish, you may cauterize the ant as previously mentioned in the manner of cauterizing warts in the chapter on cautery.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
Concerning the various instruments used for administering injections in cases of hemorrhoids, diarrhea, and dropsy.
It may be made from silver, brass, or copper which has been refined or hammered. And various sizes can be made for different users. So that the ones used to treat young children with narrow or constricted anuses should be very fine. A large syringe looks like this:
The upper part of the syringe where the nozzle is attached should be wide and have a lip where the nozzle is attached, as shown. The lower end which enters the anus should be smoothly rounded on one side with two holes drilled into it, and on the other side there should be a single hole.
The width of the hole should be about the thickness of a reed or slightly thicker. The nozzle into which you place the medicine should be made from the bladder of an animal or the skin of a lamb, and its diameter should be a fingerbreadth.
And punch many holes around it, each about the thickness of a finger apart. Then insert into these holes a tightly wound thread made from ten or so strands of wool, and gather the nozzle together like a small bag. After placing the medicine inside it, tie the top of the syringe between the two stones tightly. Then inject it with this, which is a diagram of the nozzle and hole:
And the manner of administering it is to fill the skin or bladder with the warm medicine as much as the patient can tolerate, taking care that it is not too hot or too cold. Then the patient should lie on their back and raise their legs upwards.
And place a pillow or cloth underneath him. Then grease the tip of the syringe with oil, egg white, or barley mucilage and insert it gently into the anus. Then the assistant should take hold of the nozzle with both hands and squeeze it tightly until all the contents of the syringe have emptied into the bowel.
Then the syringe is removed and the patient's legs are propped against the wall. If the medicine urges him to move, let him do so as much as he can. If he spends the entire night like this, it will be most beneficial for his cure. If it was used to treat diarrhea and its urgency hastened his exit, then repeat the injection until he is healed.
If there is haemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, let the syringe be very soft and smooth like those used for children. This is an image of a soft syringe:
Chapter Eighty-Four
In treating wounds.
I have mentioned in the division the treatment of wounds similar to cauterization, and here I mention its treatment by hand and drugs with perfection. So I say that wounds differ according to the thing that causes the wound and according to the place where the injury occurs.
The things by which wounds occur are many, such as a stone cut or sword or knife cut or spear stab or stick or arrow and similar other things numerous.
And as for wounds according to their locations on the body, they are like those that occur on the head or neck or chest or abdomen or liver and similar other organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measure and rule for other wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds particularly because compound ones will be mentioned in the first chapter of this book.
I say that whenever a simple wound occurs on the head and it is not a fracture of bone, then if it is from a stone cut or similar and has only cut the skin but the wound is large and you fear hot swelling for the patient, then immediately tie off the bleeding vessels at the site. Do not delay this, and let him bleed out according to his strength if there is no obstacle to cupping. Especially if the blood coming from the wound is slow, then let the cupping be done on the opposite side of the injury.
And warn the patient against overeating and drinking, especially from solid foods. If there is an obstacle to cupping, then reduce food intake and avoid meat and drinks. And apply a bandage soaked in rose oil alone or with cataplasm to the wound if hot swelling occurs.
If you find the boil to be hot, then apply pressure to the wound if it is still fresh and has not been exposed to air corruption, which I will describe later. But if it has already been exposed, then apply some ointment.
Until the pus is emitted, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and was caused by a sword cut or similar, and its lips do not meet with sutures, then stitch it together as I describe in abdominal surgery suturing.
If the skin has been stripped from the bone and hangs, but only attached at one point, then cut it off. Then treat the wound with medications that promote the growth of firm flesh to replace the skin. Instruct the patient to consume foods that are strengthening, such as brains and testicles.
If putrefaction occurs in the skin and does not adhere to the bone, then cut off all of the corrupted part and discard it. Then treat the wound. If there is an artery or vein bleeding profusely in these wounds and the bleeding has not stopped with medications, then search for the artery.
If he is injured but does not improve, then cauterize it with the cautery and bind it. And if necessary, even if what has been mentioned does not help, then make an incision until bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and flat, then simply treating them with this corruption while they are still bleeding is sufficient.
Before air alters it, the corruption is made by taking one part of frankincense, two parts of gall and three parts of quicklime or unslaked lime. All are ground and sieved together and pressed onto the wound with good pressure until it sticks.
It coagulates with blood, then bind it from above with sutures and leave it unattended until it stops swelling. The drug will not fall off until it heals. Quicklime alone can also be used if frankincense and gall are not available.
This action can also be done with a bandage in many large wounds, provided it is properly applied and tightened, and the wounds are still fresh with blood, as long as they have not been exposed to air, especially in summer.
There is no need to apply any of the mentioned treatments in this case. Instead, one may apply some prepared ointments or a porridge made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until pus comes out, then treat it as usual until it heals.
If the wound involves a simple fracture of the bone, treat it with traction. The treatment for skull fractures is mentioned in the chapter on surgery of the neck; if the wound is on the neck, the treatment is similar to that of a simple head wound.
If the wound has severed a nerve or an artery, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy but to avoid treating it with any caustic substance such as lead and salt because they damage the nerve.
Do not apply anything cold to the wound because the essence of the nerve is cold, and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest organ, requires that the treatments used be soothing, such as rose oil or lotion washed with fresh water and soaked in olive oil.
If the wound is large, use suturing or apply pressure with bandages until it heals.
If the wound has a depth and there is pus accumulated at its base, drain it from the lowest point. If an artery is severed and bleeding is noticed, ligate it or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound has severed some or all of the tonsils and the uvula is exposed, bring together the edges of the skin with sutures on the pharyngeal wall without touching the tonsils. Then shape the uvula into its natural form and leave it to heal.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, explore it. If there are bone fragments, remove them all or as many as possible. If not possible, leave it to heal and allow the wound to slough off naturally before removing the remaining fragments.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle it with the powder we have described. But if bone becomes exposed and it turns black and gangrenous, treat it as stated later in this book under 'Chest Surgery' and 'Surgery between the shoulders.'
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see it has depth, examine it. If air escapes when the patient breathes out, know that it is a fatal wound. But if there is no depth to the wound and it is fresh with blood, do not apply any powder at first, nor try to close it, lest blood accumulate in its depths.
Let it reach the heart and kill the patient. But apply a healing plaster twice daily, or if no plaster is available, place an old cloth in the wound's mouth to absorb its secretions, and let the patient lie on their side with the wound facing down.
If three days or more have passed since the wound occurred, and there has been no fever, faintness, rapid pulse, or shortness of breath in the patient, and you find all other conditions favorable, know that the wound is clean. Treat it with bandaging and other remedies until it heals.
But if you cannot see it and wind continues to escape, know that it has become gangrenous. Treat it according to what is mentioned in its chapter, with the patient lying on their side to drain any collection. If the chest or back is affected, treat it as previously described by suturing.
If it is large or filled with powder if small, if it has affected the bone and fragmented pieces have broken off, search for these fragments in the wound. If they are clean, remove them immediately. If not, leave them until later.
[If gangrene occurs], it facilitates the removal of the fragments. As for other wounds occurring in various parts of the body, their treatment follows the same principle as mentioned.
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
In Abdominal Surgery and Repair of Bowel Protrusion.
A laceration to the abdomen may be large or small, or moderate. A large one may allow bowel or multiple bowels to protrude, making their replacement and suturing difficult.
Similarly, the small bandage may also cause difficulty in another direction; therefore, it is necessary that its return be easier. As for the intestines, if they are not promptly returned to their place upon insertion, they become bloated and rigid, causing difficulty in inserting them. Hence, the medium-sized bandage is preferable, as it does not cause difficulty in returning the intestines like these two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen is based on four principles: The two general sutures are suitable for suturing the abdomen and other surgeries of the body. The other two special sutures are applicable to most surgeries, but they are more specifically used for suturing the abdomen.
I will describe each one to you separately with explanation, saying that if the wound is small and a part of the intestines has come out, making it difficult to return them, this could be due to either of two reasons: either the bandage is too small, as mentioned earlier, or the intestines were filled with air before they were returned.
If that is the case, it is necessary to warm them by dipping a sponge or wet cloth in lukewarm water alone, or by cooking chickpeas and lentils until they become soft enough for the intestines to pass through.
Similarly, the drink that causes constipation is beneficial for dissolving air bubbles in the intestines. Once the air has been dissipated, moisten the intestines with water boiled with onions or garlic to facilitate their return with ease.
If returning the intestines proves difficult even after this treatment, then make a small incision in the bandage using the instrument used for castration. The first remedy is preferable to making an incision, but it may be necessary if other methods fail.
The instrument has one curved side and one straight side, with a slightly blunt tip that is not as sharp as a lancet. It resembles a small spoon, as you can see. Once the wound has widened and the intestines have entered, it is necessary to return them in their natural shape.
If possible, the preferred position for this is on his back. If the wound is located in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie down with their legs higher than their head. If it is located in the upper abdomen, they should lie down with their head and chest elevated above their feet.
Similarly, if the wound is on one of the sides of the abdomen, always aim to elevate the side where the surgery is being performed higher than the other side. This is also how major surgeries and intermediate surgeries should be conducted.
And in minor surgeries, place the patient according to what you are capable of, then have a skilled assistant ready with both hands holding the cloth and gathering its edges, revealing only the area needed for suturing at a time.
This is the method of simple suturing: Take an appropriate number of needles according to the size of the wound, then leave about the thickness of a fingertip at the end of the cloth and insert one needle without threading it through the skin's edge. And with the edge of the peritoneum that is underneath the skin from inside, until it exits from that side. Having gathered the edges of the skin and the peritoneum together, making four layers, then pull tight with a double thread around the needle in all directions until the wound's edges meet perfectly.
Then leave about the thickness of a finger again and insert another needle, then tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with as many needles as needed until the entire wound is closed. Let the needles be moderate in thickness.
For thin needles cut through flesh very quickly, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin. Therefore, it is best for them to be moderate in thickness and not too thin nor too thick. Do not insert the needle too close to the edge of the skin.
So as not to cut through the flesh quickly and cause the wound to open before it can heal, nor pull too tightly while suturing so that the wound cannot heal. Then cut the ends of the needles so they do not harm the patient during sleep, and make himpadding from cotton cloth on each side to hold the needle's tips.
And leave it until you know that the wound has healed. This method of suturing with needles is most successful in minor surgeries, as they may only require one or two needles.
Regarding the characteristic of stitching for a layperson, it is to gather all four edges - namely, the skin and abdominal wall - in one go using a needle with a moderately thick thread, taking care not to make it too loose or tight. Then, after passing the needle through these four edges, bring the needle back out from where you began.
The thread should be knotted at the top of the wound so that the stitching resembles the drawstring of a bag, with each stitch being as thick as the little finger and with spaces between stitches equal to the thickness of the little finger. This method is known by all people.
With this stitching, I performed an operation on a man whose abdomen had been cut by a dagger. The wound was over a span long and about two spans of the middle intestine had protruded from it in the middle of his abdomen.
I left the intestine protruding from the wound for twenty-four hours, then reapposed it and sutured the wound. It healed in about fifteen days. I treated him until he recovered fully, and he lived many years afterwards, functioning normally in all his affairs. The doctors had previously deemed that he would never recover.
It is amazing that I did not treat him with an ointment, as I was in a place where there were no medicines. Instead, I applied gauze soaked in boiled cotton twice a day and had the wound cleaned with honey water until it healed.
Regarding one of the special types of suturing, I will mention it exactly as stated by Galen: begin stitching from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside. When you have passed through the skin and the muscle running lengthwise along the entire abdomen...
...leave the edge of the peritoneum in the side where you inserted the needle and pass it out through the other edge from inside to outside. Then, pass the needle back into this same edge from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side and pass the needle out through its other edge from inside to outside, also penetrating into the peritoneum until it emerges at the opposite edge.
Then he also began on this side with his eye near the edge that is in the lower abdomen and drew the needle from the skin near it, then inserted it back into that skin and drew the edge of the bladder that is on the other side along with this edge.
And he drew it out from the skin on his side, and did this again and repeated it until the entire surgical suture was completed in this manner. The description of this suturing is that it is like the sewing of furs by furriers.
That is, the bladder should be sutured once on one side with the skin edge and left once on the other side until it empties. And concerning the second type of specialized suturing that Galen also mentioned, this is his exact words.
And that is, to suture it in the manner that some healers suture it, by bringing each part close to its counterpart, with difficulty they join the edge of the bladder to its other edge and the edge of the ureter to its other edge. This is what I have described for you.
It is necessary that the needle be inserted into the nearby edge of the ureter from outside alone and passed through it, leaving the edges of the bladder untouched. Then return the needle and pass it from outside to inside through both edges of the bladder before returning it again.
And pass it from inside out through the other edge of the ureter on the opposite side. This method of suturing is better than common easy suturing, and this is Galen's exact words. Some have said that the abdomen can be closed with two needles. For that, you should insert one thread into them both and begin by inserting the needle from your side and passing it to the other side. Then insert the other needle from the opposite side and pass it out from your side, according to the stitching of the bags, whether it is even or uneven.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, its suturing is more difficult than other parts of the abdomen. And as for treating the wound, its rules are like those of other surgeries. If you encounter a fresh wound with blood before it has been exposed to air, replace the bowel and suture it, then apply a poultice of raw meat.
If a wound has been exposed to air, apply some of the ointments that you have prepared until it becomes inflamed and the threads fall off and the peritoneum adheres. Then treat it as you would other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have the medications, apply cotton wool soaked in boiled water to the wound from its onset and change it twice a day as I instructed until it heals. In most cases, if the wounds are simple, no further treatment is necessary unless you fear that the wound may affect the major organs.
It is advisable to dip soft lint in temperate olive oil or rose-oil and apply it around the armpits and groin areas. If there is pain or inflammation in the abdomen, often this occurs, so treat it with a warm, decoction of black gruel.
Especially if the inflammation has reached the intestines and become a penetrating wound into its cavity, know that what is thick in the intestines is easier to heal while what is thin is harder.
As for the bowel known as 'the Silent One,' it is not possible to heal it by surgery due to its many blood vessels, hardness of tissue, and proximity to nerves. But if a portion of the bowel has prolapsed and is still soft, replace it gently back into position.
If it has been a while and the prolapsed bowel has turned green or black, it is advisable to tie it with a thread above the point where it has turned black to prevent bleeding. Then cut off what is below that point.
And leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound outside so that it is easy for you to pull and remove them when the prolapse falls off and the wound becomes inflamed. Concerning wounds in the bowel, if a small tear occurs in it...
...it may be possible for some people to survive, as I have seen a man who was pierced by a spear in his abdomen, with the wound being on the right side of the stomach. The wound became fistulous and started discharging feces and wind. So I treated him, though I did not expect him to recover. I kept bandaging him until he recovered and the wound healed. When I saw that the spot had healed, I feared for the patient that some misfortune might occur in his abdomen. However, no such misfortune occurred at all, and he remained in the best of health. He eats, drinks, has intercourse, enters the bathhouse, and serves him [the patient] without any difficulty. Some experienced practitioners have mentioned that if a wound appears in the intestines, it should not be sewn up on this basis.
Take large-headed ants, then bring the edges of the wound together and place one ant with its mouth open on each edge. When it clamps down and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere and not dissolve. Then place another ant nearby.
This process is repeated with several ants according to the size of the wound, then the wound is closed and sutured. The ant heads will remain adhering in the intestine until it heals and recovers without causing any harm to the patient at all. It is also possible to suture the intestine using fine thread.
To remove the animal glue that sticks to it, after inserting it into a needle, one end of this thread is taken and pulled out with tweezers. Then a thin, twisted cotton thread is tied at its end, and this thread is inserted into the needle. The intestinal wound is sutured with the glue thread, then returned to the abdominal cavity. This method of suturing with ants and glue is only for those who are greedy or hopeful.
But if the tear is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the delicate intestines, there is no treatment nor cure for it at all.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On treating Colds and Nasal Bleeding
Know that any wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and does not heal and keeps discharging pus continuously without ceasing, is called generally, regardless of the organ it is in, a nasal bleeding. Nasal bleeding is called...
It is truly a turbid, thick, solid white fluid without pain, like the hollow of bird feathers.
Therefore, some call it a feather, and at times it is moist which constantly secretes pus; sometimes the moisture stops, and this may be abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
And I have mentioned in the division of surgeries that every ulcer does not heal nor is flesh regenerated within it, and this happens due to nine reasons; one of them being either a deficiency of blood in the body or its thickness or because there is hard flesh inside and at its edges which prevents the growth of good flesh. Or because the ulcer is very foul and dirty, or because the ulcer itself is corrupt and its nourishing matter is of poor quality, or because the remedy used for it is inappropriate, or due to an outbreak of epidemics in the town, or because of a peculiarity in the town.
Or because the ulcer is very foul and dirty, or because the ulcer itself is corrupt and its nourishing matter is of poor quality, or because the remedy used for it is inappropriate, or due to an outbreak of epidemics in the town, or because of a peculiarity in the town. As was shown in the city of Saragossa where diseases take a long time to ripen and tumors heal slowly by nature, or because there is one large bone or several bones present, and all these causes and their symptoms and treatments with medications have been explained in the division.
Here, I shall now inform you about the treatment of nasal polyps and catarrh that occur by way of manual intervention. Know that nasal polyps can affect all parts of the body, some ending in large veins or arteries, others in nerves.
Or to the peritoneum, to an organ, to the bladder, to a rib from the ribs, to a vertebra of the dorsal spine, or to a joint of the compound joints such as the hand and foot, some extending close to a principal organ.
Therefore, those nasal polyps that are of this nature are among the difficult-to-cure diseases that do not accept treatment and cause difficulty and confusion. But if there are nasal polyps that have not reached these mentioned places and one hopes and aims to treat them.
And if you wish to learn about this, take a probe made of copper or iron. If the polyp passes straight, explore it with that. But if there is a bend in the polyp, then search for it with a thin lead probe, because lead softens its body.
If upon entry it turns towards the ear, and if the mastoid has many orifices which cannot be distinguished by the probe, then inject one of its orifices with water; that water will flow into the other orifices.
Then examine thoroughly whichever side you can to determine if there is bone or nerve, whether the mastoid is deep or shallow, or if it is a single mastoid with many orifices. Note all of this according to your ability and the patient's reaction to pressure.
And similarly for other signs and causes of tumors, when you have established all this with certainty, then proceed to treatment, looking first if it is:
If the mastoid is visible and close, or in a healthy location far from joints, nerves, arteries, veins, or other places mentioned earlier, then incise the mastoid as described above and remove the swelling, corrupt flesh, and excess tissue.
And if there is flesh growing in its mouth or a wart or similar, treat it until it heals. But if the mastoid is deep and straight, do not cut into it too deeply, then clean out all the corrupted flesh.
Then use the linen thread soaked in corrosive medicine, insert it into the bottom of the mastoid that you can reach with the iron probe, do this repeatedly until the corrosive medicine eats away all the remaining corruption in the bottom of the mastoid.
Then apply ointments that promote the growth of healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal, repeat the procedure described above. But if the cause of the mastoid is bone and you have confirmed this, search for it and cut into it as I have instructed, unless prevented by some obstacle.
If bone is exposed and there is some corruption and darkness in it, scrape off the corrupted parts until they are gone, then treat it with what adheres to it until it heals. If it does not heal and continues to discharge pus as before,
Know that you have not yet reached the entirety of removing the corruption; therefore, uncover all that is upon it a second time and investigate its emptiness and purification with utmost effort. Then constrain it, for if it is sound, know that this corruption lies deep within another corruption, so uncover all that is upon it a second time.
Then investigate its emptiness and purification with utmost effort; if the bone was corrupted, it was a small one that you could pull out with mercyful tweezers suitable for that purpose, so pull it out.
If there were many bones, investigate pulling them all out without leaving any behind with utmost effort. If something from the ligaments stands in your way and there is no danger in cutting it, then cut those ligaments and flesh if they are present, and free the bones.
If it was not possible for you to extract the bones at that time, cover the wound with something that will protect it and leave it for a few days until what surrounds those bones from flesh and ligaments rots. Keep the wound clean so that the incision you made during your work does not adhere.
But if you fear that, place on it a cotton wick dipped in powdered sulfur mixed with oil or a cotton wick dipped in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For if those ligaments rot and the bones become loose, their extraction and pulling out will be easy.
If there was one large bone, such as the leg bone or thighbone etc., and only its surface had decayed, scrape it clean until that blackness and corruption disappear. Then bind the wound. But if a large part of it has decayed and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, it must be broken open.
Cut off all of it up to where the corruption ends. Then cauterize until it adheres, and I shall inform you about a patient who had a boil on his leg that I will use as an example for your guidance; this man was elderly.
About thirty years old, he felt pain in his leg from an internal cause that moved within him until matter collected in the leg and a large boil appeared, but there was no external cause. Then time passed with the negligence of physicians until the boil burst open.
Many materials were drawn from it, and its treatment was bungled until the leg became gangrenous and many mouths appeared, each emitting pus. Physicians attempted to treat it for nearly two years, yet none were skilled in surgical techniques.
I saw his leg with material pouring out of those mouths like a river, the man's body had wasted away and his color had turned yellow. So I inserted a probe into one of those mouths until it reached the bone, then I explored all the mouths.
I found that they communicated with each other on all sides of the leg. So I dissected over one of those mouths until I exposed some bone, which was rotten and blackened and putrid and decayed, so that a hole went through to the brain. Then I laid bare what I could see.
And I removed the rotten bone, believing that there was no other decay in it. Then I dressed the wound with adhesive medicine for a long time, but it did not heal. So I reopened the wound again above the first incision.
I found that the decay was connected to the bone, so I laid bare what I could see of it also. Then I dressed it again, but it did not heal or unite. So I kept exposing and cutting off piece after piece of the bone without any improvement until I had cut off about a span of it.
I removed it with its head, then dressed it with medicines which healed quickly and completely. But I had to repeat this procedure many times because of the patient's weakness, his inability to bear pain, and his fear of death, for he was constantly suffering from severe vomiting.
And solid flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his health improved. He regained his strength and could move around without any discomfort in walking, except that there was a prominence where the bone had been removed.
It is not necessary to expose it in this way. Instead, take a bandage and tie it around the projecting end of the bone, then order someone to pull it upwards. Then take another bandage made of coarser wool than the first one.
Then, tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards. Expose the flesh at the place where you want to cut without hurting the flesh with the saw, and put a wooden plank or board under the bone from below to support it.
For if you do this, the saw will not refrain from cutting into the diseased bone. It is preferable that the cut be slightly above the site of decay so that there is no decay in the interior of the bone and none appears on its surface; thus you would have to saw again.
If the bone is decayed and not protruding but connected to itself, with the decay in its center or some part of it, expose the flesh from all sides then place the board underneath and cut from the side where the decay is.
After finishing cutting from one side, cut from the other side and keep it a little away from the decay. If the decay is in a joint, cut the decayed joint itself and saw the bone where it connects on the other side.
If the decay is between two joints, there is no cure other than excision. If the decay is in the hand's bone or foot's bone, its treatment is very difficult, but you must scrape off whatever decay appears and excise and clean it as much as possible.
And how shall you proceed when no blood vessel or nerve intervenes? Know that the saws and chisels for cutting these bones are numerous, according to their position, arrangement, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness and hollowness. Therefore, you must prepare for each type of operation the appropriate instrument for that operation.
Know that the operations themselves may indicate to you the type of instrument needed if you have extensive experience and knowledge in this art, for practice makes perfect. He can deduce himself what instruments he needs for each disease, and I will illustrate for you at the end of this chapter various tools.
Make these examples your models, measure them accordingly on others, if God wills. Picture of a saw:.
Image of another saw:
Image of a small saw:.

Chapter Seventy-Eight.
In cutting off limbs and sawing bones:.
If the limbs have putrefied due to an external or internal cause, and you have treated this corruption with medicinal treatment without success, and you see that the corruption is spreading in the member without any restraint:.
Then it is necessary to cut off that member where the corruption has reached in order for the patient to be saved from death or from a great calamity worse than losing the member, and a sign of this is that the member turns black as if it had been burned by fire:.
Or it putrefies after turning black until the corruption spreads to other members and affects the body, so cut it off quickly; likewise, if the cause of corruption is due to the bite of some venomous creatures such as scorpions or snakes or spiders etc:.
Then if the corruption or bite is on the tip of a finger, cut off the finger without delay; likewise, if it has taken hold in the hand, cut off the hand from the elbow without delay lest the corruption spread to the forearm:.
And similarly, if it is taken in the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow joint itself. If decay has progressed and appears to have reached the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder whatsoever, for that means death for the patient. Use other treatments according to one's ability.
And similarly, if corruption has taken hold of the toe, cut off the toe at one of its joints. If it has affected the whole leg, cut off the entire leg. If it has risen to the knee, cut off the thigh at the knee joint.
If corruption has reached above the knee, there is no remedy for it except to leave it and submit the patient to death. The method of cutting off a member or excising it is to tie a band below the place where you intend to cut and another above it.
And stretch one servant of the lower band downward and another servant of the upper band upward. You strip away the flesh between the bands with a wide scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then cut or excise it, ensuring that strips of linen are placed on all sides.
So that the saw may not cut the correct place and cause additional pain and inflammation for the patient, if bleeding occurs during your work, quickly cauterize the place or apply some vessel-closing ligatures and then return to your task until you finish.
Then bind the wounded member with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I will tell you by way of example about a man who had this very symptom in his leg, which I am describing to you: there occurred in his leg blackness with burning like fire.
And that corruption first appeared in his toe until it took hold of the entire leg. So the man himself cut off his leg at the joint because he saw decay spreading in the member despite the severity of pain and burning. And it healed.
So after a long time had passed, this corruption appeared in the same way in his thumb. He came to me and I treated him with various medications that I had prepared for his body, but the corruption did not cease and began to spread to the other fingers.
I refused his request to amputate his hand, hoping for improvement and fearing death upon its removal, as the man's strength was declining. Upon my refusal, he left for his homeland in despair.
He cut off his entire hand and recovered. I relate this story to serve as a reminder for similar cases of this disease, and as evidence to guide action.
Chapter Eighty-Eight
On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids and the Method of Injections with Medicines.
If a tumor occurs in some fleshy member and the swelling persists until its contents collect, then it bursts forth or breaks open entirely, leaving behind an empty cavity as if it were a vessel.
And the skin covering it is like a rag, having been corrupted without much damage affecting bone, nerve, or tendon. Therefore, it deserves to be called 'hemorrhoid,' but not 'ulcer' unless its duration causes corruption in some of these parts.
At this point, it is called a ' ulcer' or 'canker.' Its treatment involves cutting away all of the corrupted skin completely, especially if it has become like a rag and is not adhering to the surrounding area due to its corruption.
If you wish for the skin to adhere and its corruption has not reached that extent, yet there is still some thickness of flesh on it, treat it by injection. If the hemorrhoid is large and its discharge has a foul smell, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
Which is made of equal parts of honey, oil, wax, and senna. Mix them together in a vessel and heat over fire until the medicine thickens like honey. Then take what you need, dilute it with water and honey, inject it into the hemorrhoid, and tie its mouth closed for about two hours.
Then remove it with pressure, doing this repeatedly until the hemorrhoid is cleaned and its foul smell disappears. Alternatively, you may use ash water if Egyptian medicine is not available. Take ashes of grapewood or oak wood and mix them with water.
Then cleanse it and cauterize with it until you are sure that the wound has been washed. If there is no tolerance for Egyptian medicine or ashes water, cauterize with water mixed with a little powdered camphor.
Or cauterize with honey and wine mixed together, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, while wine adheres to the wound especially if it is of the type that arrests bleeding and dries. Once you have done this repeatedly and are sure that the wound has healed, then cauterize with something that promotes tissue regeneration.
For example, take the ointment from the onion bulb and mix it with rose oil and an astringent drink, or cauterize with some of the other medicines and ointments whose properties have been discussed in the chapter on ointments. If the mouth of the wound is narrow so that the tip of the syringe cannot fit inside.
Then dilate it slightly with iron or insert a wick dipped in Egyptian ointment or sulfur ointment until it becomes wide enough. If the mouth is also too wide, then suture its lips and leave an opening just large enough to accommodate the tip of the syringe without further increase.
Similarly, if the mouth from which pus is flowing is elevated above, then incise it at a lower point so that the pus flows downwards. For pus when retained in the depth of the wound prevents tissue regeneration.
If you cannot incise the wound downward as desired, then elevate the organ so that pus flows out of it easily according to what is feasible for you. And make sure that no pus remains trapped inside at any time.
As for the ointments applied to the wound from outside and their method of application, take one of the appropriate stimulating ointments and spread it on a piece of linen cloth, making sure that the cloth is large enough to cover the entire wound. Then cut a piece of gauze opposite the mouth of the wound, making it slightly larger than the wound itself. Spread one of the soft ointments on another piece of gauze large enough to cover the opening and place it on top, keeping it away from the mouth of the wound to facilitate pus discharge. Do not remove the large gauze until after.
Several days, and those at the mouth of the ulcer are to be removed at all times in order for accumulated pus to exit and to know how much of what flows from it is abundant or scarce or pure or not.
And likewise, examine the site of the ulcer itself; does its owner feel pain there or not? Is there swelling or no swelling? When you have persisted with treatment like this and observe that the matter issuing from the mouth of the ulcer is becoming scant.
Know then that the ulcer has adhered or nearly adhered; therefore, release it on the following day or the third day. And when you have released the wound, replace the dressing with a new one and renew the ointment application. If thin pus emerges from the ulcer after a long period, do not despair of its healing.
So its healing is near, for among people there are those whose flesh grows slowly in wounds, and others whose flesh grows rapidly. But if thick pus emerges from the ulcer after many days, know that the ulcer has not healed; for delayed union of the ulcer has occurred.
If the condition persists, increase the drying of medications; let them be wet in substance and dry in strength, like the ointment of the nut tree if you have increased its proportion of calycotoma. And nothing is more effective than treating it with the ointment of the nut tree.
And treat it with rose oil and sprinkle on it the moderate, old wine syrup. Then knead it with this and use it as a poultice; or if you do not have the nut tree ointment, you may use honey that has been cooked until it becomes thickened. Or take an equal amount of gum arabic, storax, and calamus, grind them all together, and mix them with honey on fire. Then spread it on a cloth and apply it to the ulcer, or spread the cooked honey that has become thickened upon it; sprinkle the drugs on it, place the cloth upon it, and bind it.
And you may also use long asafoetida, the blue lily bulb, and ground frankincense alone or in combination with cantarion. Grind them together, sieve them, mix them with the honey described above, and use it; but if the ulcer persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is some underlying corruption.
Healing for fractures in bones or other solid nerves and ligaments is as previously described.
The Eighty-Ninth Chapter.
Treatment of nail disease, removal of excess flesh from fingertips, and separation of fused fingers.
The horn is excessive flesh that grows under the nail of the thumb, or perhaps other fingers, and if it is neglected, it becomes inflamed and hot.
Or if it decays and becomes offensive to the point of eating away at the root of the nail, perhaps destroying it entirely, and perhaps reaching the bone such that it has a foul odor, leaving the tip of the finger bare and discolored, then even after applying the treatment mentioned in this section, no improvement occurs.
It is necessary to cut away all the excess growth from the nail with iron, then cauterize the wound afterward. Cauterization in this case is very beneficial. And if the bone remains healthy and the nail also remains healthy.
For the angle containing the nail has caused the flesh to retract inward and become attached, so it is necessary to place a fine thread under this nail angle that presses down on the flesh and lift it up, then gently cut away this flesh.
And apply a cauterizing medication to the remaining flesh until it is completely gone, then treat with ointments until it heals. But if the decay has affected the bone, it is necessary to cut away and remove that bone, for it will not heal while there is rotting bone present.
If you find that the decay and corruption have spread to the finger, cut it off at one of its joints as previously described, then treat it until it heals. But if the nail has been struck or bruised and causes severe pain, do not bleed the patient initially.
Then cut the nail with a sharp instrument at an angle from top to bottom, being careful not to reach the flesh underneath. Otherwise you will cause severe pain for the patient and promote excessive growth of flesh in that area. Then treat the area with a medication to relieve pain.
The supernumerary finger that occurs in some people's hands may be entirely fleshy, or it may contain bone in some cases, and nail in others; sometimes it grows from the origin of a joint between two fingers.
If its growth is on the side of a finger, it does not move; but if it grows at the joint of the finger and contains flesh only, cut it off easily by severing it at its base with a broad lancet.
But if it grows from the joint itself, its removal is difficult; as for one that grows on the side of a finger, first cut away the flesh around it in a circular shape towards the bone, then scrape off the bone using one of those chisels suitable for this purpose.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the union of two fingers, this often occurs naturally at birth or due to injury from burns and similar causes; do not cut through such unions.
Until the fingers return to their natural shape, then place between them a strip of linen soaked in rose oil to prevent rapid adhesion and promote separation; or insert a thin sheet of lead between them until healing is complete.
And similarly, if union occurs between some fingers at the hand, cut through this union according to what is feasible and beneficial for restoring the normal shape of the member.
Chapter Ninety.
In treating hernias.
Hernias are tortuous, hard veins filled with black bile that occur mostly in the legs, particularly around the ankles, calves, and thighs. First, use powerful percussion to dislodge the black bile.
Then apply a cupping glass to the patient. The treatment of hernias with iron can be done in two ways: either by cutting and removing the black blood, or by cauterizing the vein and removing it entirely. In case of cutting, first heat the leg with hot water.
Until the thick, turbid blood liquefies, then tie a bandage tightly around the healthy leg from above the knee to below the ankle. Cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide cut.
Then you draw out the black blood with your hand from below the thigh upwards and upwards to downwards until you discharge as much of the blood as is seen sufficient or as the patient can tolerate, then bind it and instruct him to avoid foods that produce black bile; evacuation and cupping are then repeated.
When the veins are filled and this harms the patient, then you shave his leg if it is hairy, enter him into a hot bath, and bathe his leg with hot water until it reddens and perspires or exercises vigorously.
If a bath is not available to heat the limb, then incise the skin opposite the vein longitudinally either at the end of the knee or below it at the heel with a scalpel; then use forceps to open the skin and strip off the vein from all sides until it becomes visible.
Upon its emergence, you will find it red and venous; when freed from the skin, it appears like a cord. Then insert a probe beneath it until, upon raising it out of the skin, you attach it to a smooth, blunt forceps; then make another incision near this one, about the length of three fingers.
Then strip the skin off the vein until it becomes visible, then raise it with the probe as before and attach it to another forceps; make another incision or multiple incisions if needed.
Then draw it out and cut it off at the last incision near the heel, then pull it and draw it out until it emerges from the second incision; then pull it up to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it out from the third incision above all incisions, then cut it off completely.
If it does not yield to pulling and drawing out, then insert a strong double-thread needle under the vein and tie it, then pull it and insert a probe beneath it; twist your hand in all directions until it comes out, being careful that it does not break; if it breaks, it will be difficult for you to draw it out.
A splint should be applied to the patient afterward. After drawing out all of it, apply wool soaked in rose water or oil on the wound sites and treat him until he recovers; if the artery is twisted with branches having turnings.
The wound was not straight as we mentioned. Therefore, it is necessary to cut upon each side of its branches and places of deviation, then suspend it with sutures until all of it is closed. Be careful while cutting on it lest you sever a vein or wound it, for this would make it difficult to close.

Image of the blind suture needle:
It should not have a point like other needles nor be sharp at the end so as not to wound veins. It should be thick and smooth in its curvature because if it is thin, it may cut through veins.
Chapter One-Ninety.
On ligating a burst vein.
This vein originates in the legs, especially in hot countries like Hijaz and Arab lands. It also appears in regions other than the legs due to underlying skin inflammation.
The onset of this vein is characterized by severe pain in the leg followed by the appearance of a black spot at the site of the pain, from which the vein then emerges.
It appears like a plant or animal shoot. Once its tip becomes visible, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing between one and two dirhams, tied, and left hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it, wrap it in lead and tie it. If it becomes too long, cut off some of it and wrap the rest without cutting it at its origin until everything has emerged, as cutting it beforehand may cause scarring and inflammation.
Therefore, it should be manipulated and gently pulled until it emerges completely from the body. Sometimes, it may extend up to five or ten spans in length.
I have heard that in one case, it extended to twenty spans. If it breaks during treatment, insert a probe into its hole and pass a long thread through it along with the body until all the material inside it is released, then attempt to heal the site using medications.
Then he treated it with a remedy for tumors, and this vein may have many branches, especially if it appears at the ankle or in the leg itself, causing many mouths to open from each of which a branch emerges. Treat it as mentioned earlier in the section and what preceded it.
Chapter Two Hundred Ninety
In the opening, on the growth that occurs beneath the navel, called 'ox-humor'.
This disease is known in some of our lands as 'ox-humor' because it often affects oxen; it is a small, single worm that arises between the skin and flesh and burrows throughout the body both up and down.
It can be felt moving from member to member until it breaks through the skin at a certain point and emerges, its composition being made up of some corrupt humors like that of worms and reptiles and the habit in the belly.
Its injury is expected to be such that if it burrows into the body and rises up to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it and come out, thereby destroying the eye – this occurs frequently. If you wish to treat and remove it, then this should be done when its movement and appearance can be felt.
It is necessary to tie something above and below it with a good constricting band, then make an incision over it and remove it. If it has burrowed into the flesh and cannot be found, cauterize the area with fire until it is burned. The greatest danger is expected to be its destruction of the eye, as mentioned earlier.
If it is seen to have reached the head near the eye, tie something below it on the forehead with a good constricting band, then make an incision over it and remove it. It is necessary for the patient to undergo purification of his body with laxative drugs that expel corrupt humors and to avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
Chapter Three Hundred Ninety
In the opening, on the disease known as 'leprosy'.
This disease known in our land as 'leprosy' is a pain that appears in some members, then spreads from member to member; I have seen it as I shall describe for you.
I was summoned to a woman who had a swelling in one of the regions of her arm. I uncovered it and found a slight pulsation in the vein of the arm, which after an hour began to move upwards along with the flesh like a worm, ascending towards her shoulder joint as swiftly as mercury.
If the pain moved from one place to another, it left that spot and settled in her shoulder joint. Then, after an hour had passed, it spread throughout her body until it reached her other arm, as she told me, for I witnessed this circulation throughout her entire body.
I marveled at the speed with which the pain transferred from one limb to another, as I had never before seen this disease manifest in such a manner. Indeed, I have only seen groups of people experiencing pain migrating from limb to limb without having witnessed it so clearly in anyone else as I did in this woman.
I did not attribute this to anything other than the fact that the woman was from the desert, having a lean body and prominent veins. Hence, the moving sensation became apparent due to this constitution, which would not be visible in people of luxurious living with moist bodies and concealed veins.
If you wish to treat it when the pain becomes apparent as described, then quickly bind above and below the affected area and cut into it until the trapped wind escapes. Then dress the wound.
However, if you do not observe this manifestation with your own eyes, treat it by causing the body to sneeze and using medications that dispel wind and alleviate flatulence, such as powdered myrrh or senna leaf.
Chapter Fourty-Nine.
On Removing Arrows.
The arrows differ according to their types and the locations on the body where they hit. As for their differences in type, there are large ones and small ones; some have hollow glass heads, while others have solid glass heads. There are also those with three points or four.
And some have tongues while others have splinters. And those that hit certain parts of the body fall into two categories: either they strike vital organs, which are hollow such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, etc. If an arrow strikes any of these organs and the signs of death I have described appear, it is necessary to refrain from removing that arrow; for in most cases, the patient will die. If these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not deeply lodged within the organ, remove it and treat the wound. Among the symptoms of a brain injury are severe headache, discharge from the nose, and dizziness if the arrow penetrates the bone and injures the meninges.
If these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not deeply lodged within the organ, remove it and treat the wound. Among the symptoms of a brain injury are severe headache, discharge from the nose, and dizziness if the arrow penetrates the bone and injures the meninges. Redness in the eyes, redness of the tongue, convulsions, loss of consciousness, and possibly vomiting. Blood may be discharged from the nostrils or ears; speech may become impaired or lost; and a white fluid resembling gruel may ooze from the wound, accompanied by a watery flow like that of raw meat.
Therefore, if these signs appear, refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not yet exited. The symptoms of an arrow wound to the heart are that it feels as if it has pierced something solid near the left breast, rather than entering empty space.
And perhaps the arrow will pulse like a heartbeat; black blood may issue from the wound, followed by coldness of the extremities, profuse sweating, and loss of consciousness. Know then that death is certain; the sign of an arrow wound to the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
And the vessels following the neck become swollen, and the patient's color changes; he breathes loudly and craves cold air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be close to the ribs, causing severe pain and very rapid breathing.
And the patient sighs and all his ribs move. If the liver is struck, intense pain follows and blood resembling raw liver exits the wound. If the stomach is injured, undigested food may emerge from the wound.
His condition is obvious. If the abdomen is struck and feces, intestinal contents, or ruptured intestines emerge from the wound, there is no hope of recovery or removal of the arrow. If the bladder is pierced, urine will flow.
And something became visible from it externally and the pain intensified on the patient, so know that he is lost. As for other members such as the face, eye, neck, shoulder, upper arm, back, buttock, thigh, leg, and similar members, they are mostly spared.
If the arrow did not hit an artery or vein and was not poisoned, I shall tell you about some things I have seen regarding this matter so that you may benefit from it in your treatment: once, an arrow struck a man in his left eye at the root of his nose.
So I removed it from the other side under his earlobe and he recovered without any harm to his eye. And another arrow had struck a Jew in the corner of his eye below the lower lid, and the arrow had disappeared except for its small tip which was adhering to the sclera.
And it was a large arrow from the compound bow, made of squared iron, smooth without any feathers. The Jew recovered and no harm befell his eye. And I removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and it was an Arab arrow.
It was one that had feathers, so I made an incision between his shoulder blades and pushed it down until I removed it from his throat. The Christian recovered and was fine. And another arrow struck a man in his abdomen, and we thought he would die from it.
So after about thirty days or so, without any change in his condition, I made an incision on the arrow and removed it. He recovered with no harm done. And I saw a man struck by an arrow in his back, which adhered to the wound.
After seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his thigh. And I saw a woman struck by an arrow in her abdomen, which adhered to the wound and remained there without causing any harm or affecting her natural functions.
I also saw a man struck by an arrow in his face, which adhered to the wound and remained there without causing much pain. There are many such cases. And I removed an arrow for a soldier from the sultan's guard who was struck in the middle of his nose, slightly inclined towards the right side.
The entire arrowhead had broken off, so I was called to treat the case three days after its occurrence. I found the arrow wound very narrow, so I dilated it with a thin dilator but did not feel it, and he felt pain and discomfort under his right ear from the wound.
I hoped that this pain was from the tip of the arrow, so I applied a dressing with a strong attraction and maturation, hoping that the place would swell and the mark of the arrow would appear. But when I cut him open, nothing happened to indicate that the arrow had reached the place.
So I continued the dressing on him for many days until nothing happened, and the wound healed over while he remained anxious about its extraction until one day he felt the arrow inside his nostril. He informed me of this, so I put a strong corrosive ointment on it for several days.
Until it opened and I probed it, I felt the thin tip of the arrow stuck in the cartilage. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that strong medicine until we saw the tip of the arrow appear clearly before us, and this lasted for about four months.
Then when the wound became wide enough for me to introduce forceps into it, I pulled and moved the arrow with them, but it did not come out. So I continued to treat him and try various instruments until one day I grasped it securely with well-made forceps, as will be shown at the end of this book.
The physicians used to consider that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored, but I restored it, and the wound healed completely with no harm remaining whatsoever. And I tell you this method of extracting some arrows so that you may use it as a model for what I have not mentioned.
For the parts of this craft and their details are not grasped by description nor comprehended in a book, but only the skilled practitioner can measure the little by the much and infer new works and new tools from what is absent.
If you have understood this craft, then I say that arrows are only extracted from the organs into which they have penetrated in two ways: either by pulling them out from the place where they entered, or by extracting them from the opposite side.
If the arrowhead is prominent in a fleshy location, it should be pulled out and removed. However, if it does not yield at its initial time of impact, then you should leave it alone until the surrounding flesh decays, making it easier to draw out and remove. This applies similarly when embedded within bone.
If it does not yield to removal, also leave it alone for a few days and then attempt daily pulling and moving; if it still does not come out after some time, you should carefully bore around the arrow with a thin borer on all sides within the same bone until the space around the arrow is widened, then pull it out.
If an embedded arrowhead is in the skull and has pierced one of the brain's ventricles, showing some of the symptoms previously mentioned, do not attempt to pull out the arrow and leave it alone until the matter resolves itself after a few days.
In attempting to draw out the arrow and remove it, if it is deeply embedded and does not yield to pulling, use the borer around the arrowhead as described earlier, then treat the wound until it heals. However, if the arrow has disappeared within the body. And if the arrowhead cannot be felt, search for it using tweezers. If you find it, use suitable tools to pull it out. However, if the wound is too narrow and the arrowhead is deeply embedded without touching bone, nerve, or blood vessel.
Make an incision around the wound to widen it and then extract the arrow. If the arrowhead has two barbs, carefully cut away the surrounding flesh from both sides using any means possible. However, if you cannot remove the flesh around the barbs without breaking them off, twist and pull until they are released.
When attempting to extract the arrow from any location, use tweezers to grasp it from all sides until it is freed. Do so gently to avoid breaking the arrowhead and making extraction difficult. If you are unable to remove it within your appointed time.
Leave it alone for a time until the flesh around it decays, then return to it. If bleeding intervenes, use the treatments mentioned earlier in their chapter. Take care not to cut any vein, nerve, or tendon; use cunning instead.
Remove the arrow gently and carefully, following the steps I have described. When pulling out the arrow, ensure the patient's position is the same as it was when the arrow struck him; this will be most advantageous.
If this is not possible, use whatever position you can. As for an arrow exiting from the opposite side, it may have a protruding tip or you may feel its point pressing against the skin nearby and visible.
Make an incision over it, the size of which should accommodate the forceps. Then pull it out; if it sticks in the bone, rotate your hand until the arrow affects the bone and creates more space for itself, then pull it out.
If it will not come out, leave it alone until it emerges on its own. If the arrow's shaft is still present, use it to push it through; if the shaft has fallen off and you wish to use a pusher, insert the hollow instrument into the tail of the arrow and use it to push it through.
If the arrow is hollow, use an instrument that fits into its cavity to push it through. If the arrowhead is poisoned, it is necessary to excise all the affected flesh if possible, then treat it with an appropriate remedy.
If the arrow struck the chest, abdomen, bladder or flank and is close to any internal organ that can be felt with the palpator, make an incision over it without cutting any vein or nerve, then remove it.
Then suture the wound if necessary and treat it until it heals. Image of the forceps used to extract arrows:
Its tips resemble the beak of a bird, crafted in such a way that when it grips an arrow or anything else, it does not let go. They come in various sizes: large, small, and medium, each suited to the size of the arrow, wound width, and narrowness.

Chapter Fifty-Nine
In the matter of bloodletting
The thirty veins that it is customary to bleed in the body, six of which are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears known as the temporals, and the two arteries in the temples; and the two veins in the corners of the eyes known as the lookers.
And the vein standing in the middle of the forehead, and the vein at the tip of the nose, and the two veins in the neck called the jugulars, and the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth and the two veins in the lower lip; these veins are known as the circumoral veins. And the two veins under the tongue.
As for the five veins that are bled in the arm and hand, one of them is the cephalic vein which is on the lateral side and is commonly called the head vein; the middle cubital vein which is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic vein and is commonly called the body vein.
And the basilica vein which is on the medial side and is also called the axillary vein; it is commonly called the abdominal vein. And the radial vein which lies on the forearm and is the one that adheres to it, it is also the one that appears distinctly above the thumb. And the ulnar vein.
And the vein between the little finger and ring finger has two branches. And in the leg and foot there are three veins: one below the patella on the lateral side, the second is the saphenous vein located at the heel on the medial side, and the third is the sural nerve located at the ankle on the lateral side.
And in the other leg there are three veins like them. As for the two veins behind the ears, their benefit is in bleeding them for chronic colds and headaches and fever and chronic bad head sores, and how to bleed them as I will describe.
It is to shave the head of the patient and rub it with a coarse cloth behind the ears where the veins are, rubbing well. Then choke the patient's neck with a scarf until the veins appear and their location behind the ears in the lower part of the head is felt with your finger, and where you feel the pulsation under your finger there make a mark with ink.
Then take a sharp lancet, known as the Nisha, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein along with the skin in a straight line, the length of which should be approximately that of two folded fingers.
Or similarly, draw out as much blood as desired, then tie them with bandages and leave them until they heal. The two arteries on the temples are beneficial for treating chronic migraines, stubborn headaches, persistent eye inflammation, and sharp, constant discharge from the eyes.
To perform this procedure, the patient should tie a cloth around their head until the temples' arteries become clearly visible and palpable. Then, using a pen, mark the point above the upper temple artery with your index finger.
Then insert the Nisha lancet from below and raise the artery upwards, cutting it as you did with the other veins. Draw out as much blood as needed, then release the patient's bandage and press your finger on the artery for a moment.
Then place a bandage and gauze on it, tie it tightly from above, and leave it until it heals. The forehead vein is beneficial for treating chronic facial conditions such as measles, sores, and persistent freckles when used in conjunction with cupping therapy.
To perform this procedure, as described, the patient should tie a cloth around their head until the vein becomes visible. Then take the instrument called the "pickaxe," which looks like this:
Place the sharp point of the pickaxe on the vein and strike it from above with a comb or similar object, allowing blood to flow until the desired amount is reached. Then release the patient's headband and tie it tightly until healed.
It may also be opened with a broad-bladed lancet, but it is not advisable for the blade to be sharp-pointed like other lancets, as it should be slightly blunt and rounded at the tip to prevent accidentally breaking the bone nearby.
As for the veins on either side of the eye socket, they are beneficial for treating itching in the eyes, redness, inflammation, and facial diseases. The method to cauterize them is: have the patient tie a bandage around their neck, then sit facing their head while performing the procedure. Make a slight diagonal cut using a small wide-bladed knife.
If the spot has no flesh, then if the knife's tip is thin it may break. Send blood from a vein and apply gauze to them, tying them for one night before removing them. Cauterizing the veins of the nose treats acute fever.
For severe headache and facial diseases such as chronic inflamed pimples on the nose, cauterization is beneficial. The method: Have the patient tie a bandage around their neck, then hold their nose with your left hand while taking a long thin knife.
And pierce it in the middle of the nostril itself, between the cheeks of the nose because the vein does not appear there by sight. Then press your hand on the knife a little and send blood from that vein. Tie it for one night as it quickly heals.
And the veins on the inner thighs are beneficial for cauterization in cases of shortness of breath, leprosy, and dark diseases that appear on the skin's surface such as black spots, moles, and bad ulcers. The method: Have the patient tie a bandage under them around their neck while standing at their head.
The patient sits on a chair, then cauterize the vein diagonally in a wide cut. Send out an appropriate amount of blood or according to what is needed, then do the same for the other vein and untie the bandage.
And tie the veins with a moderate force so the patient does not suffocate. Leave them overnight as the wound will heal by tomorrow. And the veins on the ankles: cauterizing them after treating the crown of the head treats bad breath, gum disease, and bad ulcers.
Those occurring in the nose and around it, and how to cauterize them: Have the patient sit before you, tie their neck with a scarf, then turn their cheeks and observe the two veins; one is seen on the right side of the lip, the other on its left. Recognize them by their darkness.
And around them are small, dark veins; cut these off completely. If you have difficulty identifying which ones they are, target the largest and most apparent one, and do likewise with those in the lower lip.
And as for the two veins beneath the tongue, it is beneficial to cauterize them after treating the abscess of the tonsils for throat infections and mouth diseases. To do this, seat the patient before you facing the sun, raise their tongue, and observe the vein on one side of the underside of the tongue and another on its opposite side; recognize them by their darkness.
So cauterize them, but be cautious not to overdo cutting them, for beneath them are arteries; there might be bleeding from those arteries. As for the three veins that are cauterized in the elbow, it is customary for everyone to have them cauterized, and its cautery is performed in two ways.
Either by branding with a wide, curved or olive-shaped iron cautery applied gently, or by cutting with a scalpel-like instrument called the 'Nashal' [this is its shape]: Shape of the wide, curved rue cautery:
It is wide as you see, suitable for opening the rounded veins that are filled and protruding, visible, hard, and contain thick, dark blood. This is the shape of the olive-shaped cautery:
This cautery is less wide and has sharper edges, suitable for cauterizing the small veins that contain thin, yellowish blood. This is the shape of the 'Nashal' cautery:
This 'Nashal', which is suitable for cutting, comes in various widths and thinnesses according to the size of the veins, also their narrowness. They can be distinguished from one another, and they are well-known among craftsmen.
And of the basilic vein, which is one of these three vessels, its benefit in cutting it is that it attracts blood from the diseases that are under the neck and throat towards the chest and abdomen. And it is necessary for the cutter to be cautious upon its cutting, as there is an artery beneath it; so if he errs and presses too deeply with the lancet, he will cut that artery.
It is therefore necessary that it not be cut with the lancet, but rather cut open with a knife. If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then one should avoid it and turn to another vessel or search for some of its branches.
Or else, one can cut the brachial artery in its place as it is clear. Cut it with the pointed lancet as mentioned previously. But if you want to cut it specifically, then before tying the arm, examine the site until you recognize the pulse point and mark it with ink.
Then tie the arm and cut the vein with a pointed lancet as mentioned earlier, taking care to strike away from the artery. And if you see swelling at the place where you marked with ink when tying the bandage, know that it is the distention of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see that the blood gushes forth like urine, and it is thin and red, then know that it is arterial blood. In this case, promptly place your finger upon it for a long time, then remove your finger; if the bleeding ceases, often it will stop. Then tie the arm.
And leave it, warning the patient not to neglect it. Let him keep his arm on a pillow and not move it until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop and you are unable to control it with medication, then cauterize the artery if it appears to you; its ends will shrink and the bleeding will cease.
Or take an onion skin, cut it open and take one half of it. Tie it firmly over the vein with a bandage, leaving it on overnight. If the bleeding stops, well and good; otherwise treat it as mentioned previously.
Know that when the wound is small and the artery in the arm is easily ligated, then it is beneficial to tie off the dark vein [i.e., the saphenous vein], as it draws blood from the top of the head and the lower extremities.
It is preferable for the one tying [the vein] to be on the neck of the tie, as there is a nerve beneath it. If the incision is made too deep and the nerve is injured, numbness occurs which is difficult to treat, and perhaps will not heal at all.
In some people, [the nerve] is hidden and thin, hardly noticeable. In this case, the ligation should be made by a nick with a scalpel, avoiding the nerve altogether. If the vein lies between two nerves, cut it lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, it is beneficial to ligate it as it draws blood from the head.
Among the diseases of the eyes, it is particularly beneficial to ligate this vein [i.e., the great saphenous vein], especially if you wish to do so; use the olive-handled scalpel or the wide, rose-hilted scalpel for this purpose, as it is safer than all other veins because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
But when ligating, avoid cutting the muscle head with the scalpel and seek the soft spot instead. It is not harmful if the first strike does not hit; repeat the ligation as many times as necessary, although some people may swell if not ligated on the first attempt.
But swelling is not harmful. As for the method of ligation, its complications and what should precede its repair, know that ligation is either used solely to preserve health.
Or it is used in diseases, and what is used for preserving health and maintaining it, as well as preventing the occurrence of diseases, is ligating one of the three veins in the elbow: the cephalic, the dark (basilic), or the great saphenous vein. This ligation should be performed at the beginning of spring if signs of plethora are apparent.
And ligation should be performed on a Sunday or Tuesday after noon has passed three hours. As for ligations used to treat diseases, there is no specific time limit, but they should be done whenever necessary, day or night.
At every hour and at all times, it is not befitting to perform bloodletting on children until they reach fourteen years of age nor on the elderly who have exceeded sixty years. When one intends to perform bloodletting for any reason.
It is necessary to clean his bowel before bloodletting with a gentle enema if it contains much retained waste, lest putrid dregs be drawn into the veins during bloodletting causing harm to the vital organs. Bloodletting should not be performed on the sick or intoxicated until that state has passed.
And bloodletting should also be avoided after childbirth, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual intercourse, exertion, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and anything else that weakens the body or the soul. Then, examine the thinning of the humors before that if the blood is thick.
With foods, drinks, and drugs if that is possible. Then enter the bathhouse if nothing prevents it or engage in some exercise so that the blood becomes fluid and his bloodletting takes place in the morning as mentioned earlier, aiming to empty his chest of all negative psychological states that day.
Like sorrow, anger, fear, and all negative bodily conditions such as excessive exertion and sexual intercourse. And prepare his surroundings with things commonly used by people according to one's ability, like fragrant substances, perfumes, incense, and the like.
Then the bloodletter sits on a cushion higher than the one on which the patient sits. He then brings out his arm, and the bloodletter rubs it twice or thrice with his hand, then ties the bandage tightly and twists it twice or thrice, ensuring that the tension is moderate.
For excessive tightening either prevents the blood flow or if too loose also prevents it. After tying, the patient should rub his hands together to stimulate warmth.
Until the veins become swollen and distinct to touch. Then the bloodletter wipes the lancet with a little old oil, especially, and places his left hand's index finger on the same vein beneath the point where he intends to make the incision, slightly pressing down so that the vein does not escape the blow. Some veins are like strings that retreat during phlebotomy, while others are filled with wind so that when a lancet is placed upon them, they sink beneath it and deceive the one performing the procedure, not opening until much pressure has been applied.
It is therefore necessary that the phlebotomist be careful and deliberate in all these matters, then let him apply the lancet. If it opens the vein with ease, well and good; otherwise, he should repeat the procedure slightly lower or higher than the initial location with haste, provided that the site does not become swollen.
If the patient swells or becomes anxious, leave him for a day or two and do not apply a bandage, as it might bring heat to the area. Do not make him enter the bathhouse, then resume phlebotomy if desired. If the lancet was inserted and the opening was small, with thin blood flowing.
I feared that not enough blood would flow, so I inserted the lancet into the same hole again, gently and in a straight line, increasing the opening slightly. Do this quickly before the site becomes swollen, as many people's sites swell even with a small opening.
If it has become swollen, do not repeat the procedure upon it again, for it will be of no use. Place upon it some powdered incense mixed with oil, as this facilitates blood flow and is better in this regard than plain oil or any other fat.
So use powdered incense mixed with oil in all phlebotomies when blood flow is difficult. Also, the drugs Faroukh Triage and Schizandra can be used on the site, as they cause thick blood to become thin and fluid.
If a large swelling occurs at the phlebotomy site, especially in those who have not undergone venesection before or had a small vein opening, quickly apply a warm compress of saltwater-soaked sponge to it and leave it there for some time, as it dissolves the swelling.
It is preferable to do this after blood has completely ceased flowing from the vein or from another vein. If there remains any blackness or greenness at the site after a few days, it causes no harm. If desired, apply a solution of myrrh and frankincense to it.
And some of the juice of fennel and the like, for often a swelling and tumor appears at the vein when bloodletting is done. Place your hand upon it; if it yields to gentle pressure when you press upon it, that is a bad tumor. Therefore, beware of applying anything we have mentioned to it.
For it may be that the blood of an artery has flowed out from it, so bind it with something that constrains and stops the flow. Then treat him with other remedies until he recovers. It is proper to let out blood in proportion to one's strength and the prevailing color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it becomes red. And if it appears thick, thin it out until it thins. And if it is sharp, remove its sharpness. This applies particularly to those who are full-bodied and strong and require a sudden release of blood.
That bloodletting should be done in wide veins and the lancet should be thick. For the weak, it is the opposite of this. It is preferable to do it repeatedly with a narrow opening. The best instrument for bloodletting from veins is a sharp, pointed, slit blade without a guard.
This method of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and cutting nerves. It is gentler and safer than bloodletting across or lengthwise. For those who are prone to fainting during bloodletting, it is preferable to feed them before the procedure with bread soaked in pomegranate juice or tamarind water.
If the lancet is sharp and blood has been drawn three or four times, especially if the patient has a cold temperament, let him take bread soaked in syrup of figs, or honey syrup perfumed with ambergris, or good rosewater syrup before bloodletting.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting due to excessive bleeding, let him drink beef broth and thin rosewater syrup. Use frankincense for perfuming and apply it to his chest. Also use the other remedies mentioned in the chapter on fainting.
That which is from sneezing. And as for one who wishes to loosen his arm and release his blood a second time, if his bloodletting was for much evacuation and his strength is weak, let the blood be released gradually little by little according to his strength over consecutive days.
If one desires to drain the blood from his arm and to relieve its pressure, especially if he is robust in body, he should do so within seven or nine days after the first onset. However, if one wishes to draw the blood from his body towards the opposite side where it has congregated, then he should not proceed until the second or third day.
However, if the blood in one's body is copious and hot, causing fever, it is not permissible to let too much blood out at once; the opening should be gradually widened until it reaches the desired depth, ensuring all conditions for cupping are met. And place your hand on his pulse during the bleeding to prevent death at the site of the cupping, for this often occurs if the operator is ignorant or careless. It is not permissible to do so if you intend to relieve the arm and drain blood again.
If the vein's mouth becomes blocked and blood flow is slow, do not press hard or twist excessively; instead, either leave it until the next cupping session or use a lancet to gently scrape away any clotted blood blocking the vein's opening.
Alternatively, apply a solution of saltwater or carry out cupping with the help of Frankincense or Myrrh, gently expressing blood from the vein. If the vein becomes swollen, leave it alone.
Do not touch him until the swelling subsides. If necessary, bloodletting must be done again, either at the same site or at another vein on the other arm.
For cupping the arm's vein, use a lancet instead of leeches if they are unavailable or hard to find, as the vein contains both blood and lymph. To perform cupping, immerse your hand in hot water until the skin reddens and veins become visible, then tie a bandage tightly but moderately above the site.
Then cup the vein slightly diagonally, neither horizontally nor vertically; make the opening wide. Perform cupping above the wrist joint. If blood does not flow out, reimmers your hand in the hot water and allow the blood to flow into it.
Until you reach your goal, if it is in the days of summer, you may dispense with immersing your hand in hot water again. Blood flow in hot water runs more swiftly during wintertime. But draining this vein is safer than all others. If it does not lie beneath a prominent vein or nerve, then cupping the wrist of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments. To perform this procedure, tie the arm with a bandage or press it with your hand while submerged in hot water until the vein swells.
If it does not lie beneath a prominent vein or nerve, then cupping the wrist of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments. To perform this procedure, tie the arm with a bandage or press it with your hand while submerged in hot water until the vein swells. It becomes evident to the touch, then cup it slightly askew. Even if you remove too much, it does not harm him. Be careful not to linger with the scalpel because beneath lies a nerve of the fingers and bare flesh.
Let blood flow freely. If you do not immerse it again in hot water, the blood will clot at the mouth of the vein and cease to flow. After removing enough blood, apply oil and salt to prevent rapid clotting.
And do the same with every narrow vein. As for cupping on the left hand, it is beneficial for spleen ailments and is done likewise as before. Cupping of the calf benefits lower body illnesses such as uterine problems.
And for retention of menses, kidney diseases, chronic sores on thighs and legs, and similar ailments. To perform cupping on the leg, immerse it in hot water and apply a massage until the veins appear. Then tie above the ankle joint with a bandage, and cup at the heel where the vein is prominent like the thumb.
And many veins branch out on the face of the foot. Therefore, cup at its widest vein or at the heel where they converge. If you cup on the sole of the foot, beware of the nerves underneath.
And perform cupping slightly askew, as if you intend to cut him. If blood does not flow out easily, immerse his leg again in hot water and let blood flow until it empties completely. If the cupper misses the vein on the first attempt,
It should be tied above with a ligature, slightly higher. For if the site is healthy, no harm is feared from it, provided care is taken not to damage the nerve, as we have said. The same applies to tying the vein on the other leg, regardless. As for the vein of the groin, its location is as we have mentioned, at the back of the thigh.
The benefit of tying the vein for pain in the hip is if it is due to hot blood. The method of tying: the patient should enter a warm bath and then quickly pull the leg from below the hip upwards towards the heel with four fingers using a thin, long cloth.
If it appears, then tie it in any case; either by displacing (the vein), which is better, or by amputating with a blade or incising. The site is safe and often quite deep; if you cannot find it.
If it does not appear at all, then tie some of its branches; those that are visible on the back of the foot near the little and ring fingers. Take care not to damage the nerves and allow only as much blood to flow out as desired.
Then release the pressure, apply a cloth to the site of the ligation, and press it. It will heal quickly.
Chapter Sixty-Nine.
Concerning cupping (hijama) and its method of use.
There are various types of cups used for cupping: they may be made of horns, wood, copper, or glass. There are two types of cupping procedures: one involving cauterization and bloodletting, the other without cauterization.
Of these two methods of cupping without cauterization...
...the nape of the neck, the occiput (back of the head); the hollow of the throat; the chin (underneath the lower jaw); the shoulders; the lumbar region of the back; the elbows; and the knees.
Cupping is used to draw blood from the veins that are distributed throughout the flesh. Unlike phlebotomy (venesection), it does not cause weakness. It should not be used with fire or without in cases of diseases involving fullness until the body has been completely evacuated.
If bloodletting is needed due to illness or habitually, we practiced it at any time, at the beginning, middle, or end of the month, regardless of the timing.
And among people, some feel heaviness and headache in their heads when they have too much blood that needs to be removed by bloodletting. Others experience fullness and redness in their faces, heads, and necks. Still others feel itching in their faces and behind their ears, darkness and blurring in their eyes, or they scratch the spot where they were cupped.
And among them, some laugh excessively. Others taste blood in their mouth and tear at their lips or vomit blood. Some sleep too much. And others see blood, redness, wounds, and surgeries in their dreams. Whenever we observe any of these things...
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we commanded bloodletting after two or three hours have passed since noon. The benefit of cupping therapy for bleeding circles is that it relieves heaviness in the head and prevents water from flowing into the eyes.
However, it is preferable to perform this after purging the body completely. This bloodletting may be used instead of venesection (bloodletting from veins). It should not be used on those with a cold temperament or a recent illness, as it would cause them great harm.
Therefore, it is not advisable to use cupping therapy on the elderly, those with cold illnesses in their heads, or those who have become addicted to it and have lost their memory.
Therefore, it is advisable to command the cupping practitioner to slightly lower his hand with the cup downwards, fearing the onset of fainting. As for cupping on the nape of the neck, it serves as an alternative to venesection from the thigh and buttock.
Therefore, cupping is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, heaviness in the chest, coughing, and fullness. It is advisable to raise the cupping cup on the nape of the neck slightly, as it may cause weakness in the heart and stomach if pulled downwards.
As for cupping on the temples, it is beneficial for severe headaches, eye inflammation, migraines, neck pain, and toothache. It serves as an alternative to venesection from the buttock. It is advisable to command the cupping practitioner not to insert the lancet too deeply to avoid cutting a vessel and causing bleeding.
And as for cupping under the chin, it is beneficial for treating ailments in the mouth such as dental abscesses and tooth decay. It serves as an alternative to venous bleeding from the cheeks. And cupping of the shoulders is beneficial for treating palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
And cupping on the buttocks is beneficial for what benefits bloodletting from the three large veins: basilic, temporal, and cubital. It draws blood from all the lesser vessels in the flesh, drawing those vessels until it reaches the three thick vessels.
It is necessary to command the cuppers not to dwell on the buttocks, for it is a naked place with nerves and vessels underneath. However, a single cupping cup placed on the spine is beneficial for hemorrhoids and lower abdominal ulcers.
And it is necessary to command the cuppers that the cups should be large and made of copper, for the place requires strong suction. Glass cups may break frequently, and they require many preparations. And cupping of the legs reduces swelling noticeably.
For it draws blood from the entire body, and is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder. It regulates menstruation, treats boils and freckles, and serves as an alternative to phlebotomy of the elbows and knees, except that it greatly weakens the body and causes dizziness in most people. And cupping of the elbows has benefits similar to cupping of the legs.
The method of applying the cups is to first place them empty and create moderate suction, without lingering too long. Quickly apply and remove the cups to allow the humors to evenly flow into the site. Repeat this process until you see that the area has turned red and opened.
And when the blood has turned red, then you tighten and gradually release the suction. Then observe the state of the body; if the person is thin-skinned with loose pores, it is sufficient to perform cupping once only, so that the area does not become scarred.
The surgeon must dilate the incision slightly and deepen it, gently adjusting the stitches with careful movements. If blood is thick, he should perform the procedure twice; in the first instance to open a path for the free flow of blood and fluid, and in the second to ensure thorough removal of the thickened blood.
If the blood is very turbid, he should perform the procedure a third time to achieve the desired outcome. In summary, if one aims to remove only a small amount of blood, one incision will suffice; however, if one intends to remove a large quantity of blood, multiple incisions are necessary.
It is necessary to make the incision deep and moderate, extending only to the depth of the skin. It is not permissible for the surgeon to use ointments or waters at the time of cauterization; those with thick, hard, rough skin and narrow pores should be avoided.
It is not permissible to apply ointments to the cauterization sites, especially those that are opened or dissolved. However, if it is summer time, one may use oils such as olive oil, violet oil, sweet almond oil, or melon seed oil.
And if it is wintertime, oils such as narcissus oil, rose oil, frankincense oil, or saffron may be used. If the ointment is thick and cold, use oils like mercury oil, gall nut oil, butter, or wax, among others.
If the patient has large pores, soft flesh, and profuse sweating, it is not permissible to use ointments. These individuals should wash their cauterization sites after bloodletting with rose water, cold water, dog's grape juice, melon water, or pomegranate juice, among others. If the patient has moist, copious blood.
They should wash their cauterization sites with vinegar, water from the ash and sumac trees, or similar substances. If the ointment is thick, they should wash with old wine, mercury oil, pomegranate decoction, frankincense, or similar substances. Bloodletting should be avoided in hot baths and immediately after bathing.
It is preferable to use it after leaving the bathhouse by one or two hours, and no one should sleep afterwards. The bleeding cupper and assistant should prepare him before and after cupping.
First, one should look to see if the patient or assistant is yellowish. If so, it is preferable for them to consume cool substances such as pomegranates, spinach, vinegar, onions, and similar items. Their diet should consist of vegetables like lettuce, and light meats like mutton, fish, and similar foods.
For those with a cold disposition, they should drink honey water or rose syrup. They may also consume moderate perfumed wine and reduce their food intake. Their diet should consist of lettuce, broad beans, young pigeons, and sparrows. On the day of cupping and bloodletting, they should consume more liquid than solid food.
In some cases, it may be preferable for certain people to drink Farouq's treacle or musk medicine or silphium before cupping or bloodletting, and after that to strengthen the main organs and relax the blood. It should not be given to those with weakened constitutions.
As for cupping that is done without a restriction, it is performed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, heart, kidney area, and buttock. These organs do not tolerate restriction cups, as the intention is only to draw blood from one organ to another.
We place the cupping glass on the breasts for the treatment of engorgement, or use it to remove cold wind from an organ when it has lodged therein. We also place it on the abdomen and chest to loosen the organ, heat it, and relieve its pain by dissipating that wind.
Cupping may be applied to the kidneys if there is a blockage or stones present, as the force of suction may open the blockage or dislodge the stone from its position. The same applies when placed on the liver or spleen for wind obstruction. These cuppings are performed using empty cups with only mild suction.
It can be used with fire and can also be used filled with warm water for the treatment of swellings. This is done by filling the cupping glass, which should be large, with hot water alone or with water in which some herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Then it is placed filled on the spot and held, removed and repeated as many times as necessary. This is an image of the cupping glass that is used with fire:
The opening of its mouth is two fingers wide, as shown, and its depth is half a cubit. On one side of it there is a small hole the size of a needle's entrance. It is made of Chinese copper or yellow copper with thick rims.
It is smooth and flat, polished so as not to harm the limb when placed upon it. In its center there is a transverse tube of copper or iron where the candle is placed for fire. These cupping glasses can be made large or small according to the diseases.
And its use is that the cupping glasses for children and thin people are not like those for men. As for how to apply this cupping glass with fire on the limb, it is done by taking a tightly woven linen wick or a small wax candle made of pitch and placing it on the middle of the raised tube in the center of the cup.
So that the fire rises upwards towards the bottom of the cup without burning the patient's body. Then it is placed on the limb with the finger on the hole mentioned until, when we hold the cup, we no longer need to remove the finger.
And the steam comes out through that hole and the cup adheres to its place. Then the wick is extinguished as before if necessary. But the cupping glass used for treatment of swellings with water does not have a raised tube or a hole.
Rather, it is used by filling it with water and placing it on the limb. This is its image:
And the larger this cupping glass is to hold more water, the better.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
Regarding the treatment of hemorrhoids.
Ligation is used in most cases for members on which cups cannot be placed, either because they are too small like the lips and gums, or because the member is bare of flesh like fingers and nostrils.
The use of it is to take the leech that is found in fresh, pure waters from marshes, then leave it for a day and a night in fresh water until it starves and nothing remains inside its belly. Then evacuate the body first through cupping or bloodletting, then wipe the affected limb.
Until it turns red, then place it upon [the wound]; when it fills up and drops off, if possible, suck the spot with a leech; otherwise, wash the spot with vinegar then with much water, rub it, press it, and squeeze it. If bleeding continues after the leech falls off, that is considered purging. Then soak a cotton cloth in cold water.
Then place it above until the bleeding stops. If blood is abundant, sprinkle powdered gum arabic or myrrh or similar astringents upon it until bleeding stops; otherwise, place half-roasted barley flour on the spot.
And leave it until the barley flour adheres to the spot; if blood stops. If another leech is needed, do not reuse that one if possible; otherwise, wipe the spot with fresh blood.
Or insert a needle into the spot until some blood comes out, then place it; if it senses any blood, it will adhere to the site. If you wish for it to fall off, pour some myrrh or salt or ashes upon it.
Chapter Three.
Regarding Fractures.
This chapter also contains what is necessary for the art of medicine, namely: the reduction and setting of displaced fractures and dislocations of bones.
Know, O my sons, that many physicians who are ignorant and common people, as well as those who have never read any books of the ancients nor studied even a single letter from them, claim this chapter.
Therefore, this art has become extinct in our country, and I have never found anyone proficient in it at all. However, I benefited from what I did because of my extensive reading and study of the books of the ancients, and my persistent effort to understand them. Then, I adhered to practice and experience throughout my life.
I have drawn for you here all that my knowledge has encompassed. And I have gone over my experience in this, bringing it close to you, purifying it from verbosity, abbreviating it as much as possible, clarifying it as much as possible, and illustrating for you many images of the instruments used therein.
As it is an excess in explanation, like what was done in the preceding chapters. And there is no strength except with Allah the Most High.
The First Chapter.
In this section are summaries and comprehensive discussions about the matter of broken bones. And before we begin mentioning the fractured limbs, one by one, it is necessary to mention in the introduction of this chapter summaries without speeches. First of all, you must understand and grasp its true meaning, you and whoever else is eager to learn this noble art.
So I say that whenever anyone breaks or dislocates or twists or falls, it is not permissible to hasten first to set or stretch or both. Unless there is something preventing that, such as weakness of strength, or if the person involved is a child, an old man, or very frail, or if the time is extremely hot or cold.
Then his diet should be restricted to cold legumes, poultry, and fish. He should avoid drinking beverages and consuming tough meats or foods that fill the veins with blood until the swelling has subsided and no more fluid is expected to accumulate at the site.
When that happens, the patient should return to his usual diet. If the fractured bone is being pushed into place, the patient should not consume foods that are very tough and sticky, like dates, rice, brains, lentils, or cow's hooves. And eggs, fried fish, thick beverages, and similar things. For by this method, the healing of the fracture will be quicker and better. Know that fractured bones in strong men and old people can never unite and adhere to their original nature.
Because the hardness and brittleness of their bones, although some may unite like the bones of young children. Nevertheless, nature produces on the broken bone something resembling glue that sticks and binds it together from all sides.
It binds itself together until it reaches its former state of strength and solidity, such that nothing hinders its actions.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide the patient with foods that are solid and viscous, as we have said. Know that fractures differ in type according to the variation of limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone differs from that of the skull, and a fracture of the rib cage differs from that of the spine.
Similarly, all other limbs differ from one another. We will come to mention each type of fracture in its respective chapter, detailed and distinct from others; for the type of bone fracture may also vary.
For a fracture may occur without splinters, or it may be along the length of the bone with both sharp and blunt fragments; it may also occur accompanied by wounds and lacerations of the skin, or as a slight crack.
Each type has its own specific method of treatment, as will be mentioned in detail later. Among the indications for bone fracture is its deformity, numbness, prominence to touch, and cracking sound upon pressure with the hand.
However, if there is no apparent deformity, no cracking sound upon pressure, no disturbance felt when touching the bone, and the patient does not complain of much pain, then it is not a fracture but rather a sprain, slight fracture, or minor crack. In such cases, do not manipulate or press the limb excessively.
But rather, apply to it the medications that will be mentioned later, which are appropriate for its location. Then gently traction is applied. Know that when a bone fractures into two pieces without any splinters, each piece completely separates from the other.
It is not permissible for you to rush into reducing and immobilizing it until the inflammatory swelling has subsided. If an inflammatory swelling occurs, leave it alone until it subsides, then reduce and immobilize it with gentleness and skill.
Know that reducing and immobilizing a bone with splinters is easier than one without. Then proceed as will be mentioned later. If the bone has splinters, it is necessary to traction the fractured limb from both sides, whether it is an arm or a leg.
If the limb is small, then use your hand; otherwise, use two threads or both thread and hand. Ensure the limb's position is level and in its natural shape until the fractured bone extends. Then, gently push back the protruding parts into their original places with care and skill.
Strive to cause no pain or discomfort to the patient through your actions. Aim to join one bone to its companion in the best possible way, and at this time you should examine and feel them with your hand. If you find anything amiss, rectify it to the best of your ability.
And beware of excessive pressure and forceful squeezing, as many unskilled individuals do. They often speak of having done so, but this may result in burning or cauterization of the limb, which I have seen happen repeatedly.
Then, after the bone has been aligned and secured, instruct the patient to keep it still and at rest. Warn them not to move it during wakefulness or sleep, or during any turning, disturbance, or stretching, and advise them to use a splint that prevents pain.
And if the patient feels pain or discomfort with the current splint, they should shift to another that does not cause pain, ensuring that it remains straight and level.
Otherwise, the limb may become deformed upon healing. As for how to splint a broken limb, know that they differ in size and shape, so small ones like arms, fingers, hands, etc.
Therefore, for small limbs, the bandages should be soft and pliable, while for larger ones like thighs, back, or chest, they should not be too tight as this would constrict the limb evenly on all sides without causing any harm.
Once you have finished aligning the bone, begin applying the appropriate plaster cast. Gently place the plaster on the fracture site, then begin wrapping the bandage around it three or four times, depending on what the limb requires. Tighten your hand lightly with the bandage, then bring it up to the upper side of the fracture.
Bind slightly less than your usual tension on the broken site, then withdraw with winding somewhat from the fracture site and loosen gradually little by little until you obtain some suitable material from the correct site. Then take another bandage and wrap it around the broken site as well.
Wrap it several times, then proceed with winding to the lower side of the fracture. Ensure that your action in tightening and loosening the wrapping matches what was mentioned earlier regarding the upper first wrap. Then insert between the wrappings a piece of soft linen or cloth sufficient to straighten the fracture.
If there is no deformity, do not add anything. Then wrap another bandage around it and secure it with these well-made wrappings from your clock if the limb has neither swelling nor heat.
If there is swelling or heat, apply something to alleviate the swelling and reduce the inflammation. Leave it for some time, then tighten the splints upon it at that point. The splints should be made of half-dried reeds, skillfully prepared, or they may be made of ebony wood.
Which are made from pinewood or palm leaves, rushes, or reeds and the like that are readily available. Each splint should be of this same size and shape.
Except for the splint placed directly on the fracture, which should be slightly thicker and wider than the others. As for the length of the splint, it should be made according to the appropriate size of the broken limb, its picture is as follows:
Then secure the splints with another bandage according to your original tension, then tie it firmly from above with strong threads as mentioned earlier in binding, ensuring that your tension on the fracture site is greater. The further away from the fracture, the less tension there should be.
The threads should be of medium thickness and fineness, preferably made of moist cotton thread, as using coarse threads like those seen from ignorant people who use thick strips of cotton cloth is a great mistake.
For it falls short externally of moderation, and the linen threads are also unsuitable because you cannot achieve what you want by pulling with them. It is not proper that there be less than a finger's breadth between one stitch and another.
If the patient is harmed by the ends of the sutures after pulling in the correct places, then place beneath them a piece of linen or soft wool padding until no harm comes from it. But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound and there is a tear in the skin, we will come to that separately.
Know that not every broken limb should be sutured on the first day. For if it is large, stitches should not be placed until after five or seven days, or more, depending on whether there is fear of inflammation.
This is the description of the bandages with which the ancients used to dress fractures and dislocations, a general concise dressing that fixes the fracture and suits most temperaments, especially children and women, because it does not incline towards heat or cold.
Take from the flour dust that adheres to the walls of the millstone when it is moved by the millstone, mix it as it is without beating with egg whites and make its mixture neither too thick nor too thin, then use it.
This is another dressing for fractures, dislocations and sprains. Take ten dirhams of each of the following: barley groats, oatmeal, aniseed, nigella seeds, frankincense and saffron; five dirhams each of myrrh and incense; twenty dirhams of olive oil; and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Roman earth. Grind all of these together and mix with olive oil water or egg whites if the patient's temperament is hot. Then use this dressing, for it is well-composed and quickly sets broken bones, suitable for most people due to its balance.
This is another dressing that also benefits fractures and sprains. Take ten dirhams each of frankincense, barley groats and white barley flour; five dirhams each of myrrh and incense; six dirhams of aniseed; and twenty dirhams of Armenian earth. Grind all finely, sift, mix with water or egg whites and use.
A compress for dislocated joints and broken bones that have shifted from their places, to alleviate sudden pain and bone fractures, as well as headache. White wool is taken, soaked in vinegar and cooked oil, and placed on the location. This compress has no healing power.
A compress for cooling hot swellings and relieving pains, especially. Another compress to heal broken bones: dates leaves and bramble leaves are taken together, crushed, and applied wet. Another shorter compress used when a bone is forced out of joint.
To analyze the remainder of a tumor, take equal parts of aloeswood, papyrus, and violet leaves, grind them all together, mix with plaster if the organ is not inflamed; if it is inflamed, use water from coriander or water instead.
Another stronger compress for analyzing solid tumors when bones are displaced: take equal parts of aloeswood, bdellium, colocynth, garland flower, rue, violet leaves, and papyrus.
Grind all together and mix with vinegar water, fresh water, or plaster according to the organ's heat and its quietness. Hippocrates did not mention applying it directly to the broken member when healing.
Except for the Quruttiyy compress made of wax and oil alone, which he described to be medium between hardness and softness. Galen saw that things with dryness and some heat, like myrrh, ginger, and frankincense (as mentioned earlier), should be placed on the broken member during healing.
A compress beneficial for weakness and pain: take equal parts of nard, sesame, human hair or bird feathers, aloeswood, and salt. Grind, sieve, mix, and apply as a compress. As for the amount of bandage that should remain...
...then examine it. If no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone occurs, do not change it often; but if severe itching, intense pain, or swelling appear...
Hurry to lanced it at the right time, do not delay that at all. Then apply a bandage to it and then take a soft cloth or sea sponge moistened in warm water and wash the place until the itching subsides and the pain ceases. Then leave the member to rest for an hour.
Then wrap it with white wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose ointment and tie it overnight to ensure the hot swelling subsides, reduce member inflammation and alleviate its pain. Then resume gentle traction and light bandaging, not as strong as the first one.
And treat it until it heals. If you find that the swelling, redness, pain, inflammation and all symptoms have completely disappeared and you need to resume bandaging and traction, then repeat as originally done. Otherwise, do nothing further if no symptoms mentioned occur in the member.
Do not lanced it again until three or four or five or seven days have passed, and sometimes it may be left for twenty days depending on the appearance of the member as mentioned earlier. Until when you find that it is necessary to break open and flesh has formed upon it.
Then at that time increase traction more than the original one altogether and also increase the thickness of the invalid's food as mentioned earlier. If you find that the site of fracture has dried up and wasted more than it should, then know that nutrition is prevented from reaching it.
Then rinse it with warm water every time you lanced it, doing this once every three days and slightly reduce traction. For by this action nutrition is brought to the member and it heals quickly. But as for what ignorant people do in breaking the member again.
If they did not originally set it properly and then reset it crookedly, this is a mistake on their part and a great error. If it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it, but I have not seen anyone do it at all. And the correct thing to do is not to follow that practice.
Chapter Two.
On fractures of the head.
Types of fractures that occur in the head are many and varied, with diverse shapes and intricate causes. Among these fractures is one caused by a sword blow; this may either break all the bone until it reaches the peritoneum beneath the bone. And as it does in wood.
So this type of fracture is called 'qadumi', and if the sword cuts only part of the bone, breaking its surface but not penetrating all the way through, it is called a 'sulaiba' fracture. The wound in both types may be large or small.
Another type of fracture occurs from a blow with stone or a fall onto stone, appearing as a bruise or laceration. This fracture may either penetrate close to the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be located on the surface of the bone.
Similarly, the wound in these fractures can also be large or small. Another type of fracture is hidden within the bone like a hair's breadth, causing dizziness.
And this type of fracture is called 'sha'iri'. Another type occurs from a fall or blow with stone, entering the surface of the bone like a coin into copper.
Such fractures are more common in children with soft skulls. In all these types of fractures, there may be sharp or blunt fragments. We will discuss the treatment of each type later. Now we will describe the examination to identify these types of fractures.
And the examination involves using tweezers and removing rotten flesh. The 'sha'iri' type can be identified by wiping the bone with ink; if there is a fracture, it will appear black. As for treatment, first consider the patient's symptoms.
If you observe symptoms that strongly indicate fear, such as vomiting, prostration, loss of consciousness, sudden onset of fever, dilation and redness of the eyes, do not approach or treat the patient, for death is imminent in most cases with these symptoms.
But if you see signs that do not cause concern and hope for recovery, then take the following measures to treat him: If the injury occurs during winter...
It is necessary to strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case, and during the summer days it is necessary to hasten its removal before the seventh day, lest what lies beneath the bone from the membrane should rot, thus exposing those symptoms which we have described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane surrounding the brain and is accompanied by wounding and inflammation, it is necessary to cut off the shattered and infected part as I have described for you, which is to shave the head of the injured person.
And when you expose the bone, proceed however and according to the shape of the wound and what is apparent to the patient. If upon revealing the bone there is bleeding or a hot swelling, then respond accordingly.
And that you stuff the place with cloth dipped in syrup and honey and rose water, and sew up the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding is secured. Then proceed to cut and remove the bone, which can be done in one of two ways.
As for the first way, it is to cut the bone with a fine narrow-bladed knife, and this is its appearance:
Then use another blade after this one, slightly wider than the previous one. This is its appearance:
And also use another blade, even wider than the second one. And you should have a variety of blades with some being wider and others shorter, all with very sharp edges, made of Indian iron or good steel.
And use gentleness when striking the blade so as not to shake the head and cause injury. If the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary to drill around it before using the blades with the drills called 'non-recessed drills'.
Because these drills do not exceed the thickness of the cranial bone beyond it, as their tip is rounded like a collar or small circle which prevents them from penetrating too deeply and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
And you should have many of these drills, each suitable for a certain thickness of bone. Thus, you will have drills for every skull with tips that are long and short according to the thickness of the skull. Here are three types: Of trepanations, there are large, medium, and small:
And as for the manner of drilling around the broken bone, it is to place the trepan on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been perforated, then move the trepan to another location and leave a space between each drill equal to the thickness of a barley grain or thereabouts.
Then cut with the saw what is between each two drill holes, and do so with as much gentleness as you can, as we have said, until you remove the bone either by hand or with some other tool prepared for that purpose.
Like the forceps and gentle tongs, and it is necessary to be very careful that the trepan or saw does not touch the peritoneum. If you hollow out the bone and free it from the peritoneum if it was adhered to it, and remove it, then do not strip [the bone].
And smooth the roughness that remains in the bone with another tool resembling the saw, but it should be finer and gentler than other saws. If there are any small bones or fragments left, remove them gently with whatever tools you have.
Then treat the wound afterwards with bandaging and ointments, as mentioned. As for the other side of the operation, it is an easy matter far from danger, as Galen mentions and praises greatly; and this is his saying: It is necessary for you first to begin by exposing a part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most severe and prominent, until when you expose that part you see beneath it the end of this lentil-shaped saw, which looks like this:
The lentil-shaped part of it is smooth and does not cut anything, while the sharp part is on its sides extending lengthwise as you see. Thus, the lentil-shaped part rests on the peritoneum and the sharp edge of the saw is on the bone, then strike the saw from one side only.
With a small hammer until you cut through the bone gently as it turns, and you are safe from harm to the membrane even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and weak among people indeed even if he is blind.
If there remains something attached to the bone from the membrane in some places of the bone, scrape it off gently with the pointed end of the lentil-shaped probe and remove it carefully, for it will detach without harm or fear.
And if a bone fracture did not reach the membrane and what was broken off from the bone is its face, with small fragments and rough edges remaining within it, then you should remove those rough edges and extract those fragments using delicate forceps of various sizes that have been prepared for this purpose, so that you may choose from among them whatever fits best in each situation according to the requirements of the task.
And in the case of a broken bone and its shape, you should first use wider forceps to grip the bone, then proceed to use narrower ones gradually, continuing in this manner until you reach the use of the finest and thinnest ones.
And as for small cracks and minor fractures, you should treat each one according to what is appropriate for its repair, which is something that is not hidden from anyone who has even the slightest training in this field and who has paid attention to what we have written and demonstrated regarding major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, then take a piece of cotton cloth appropriate for the wound and dip it in rose oil, place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular piece of cloth. And dip it in honey and rose oil and place it on top of the first cloth, doing so with great gentleness to avoid weighing down the intestines, then use a wide bandage from above without pulling too tightly except enough to hold the wound closed.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until the inflammation has subsided, then remove it and afterwards use powders made from beneficial substances such as onion roots, frankincense flour, almonds, and celery seeds, among others.
And sprinkle them dry on the wound as they are, and in general, use a medication that has the property of cleaning without causing inflammation. Be sure to keep your treatment of the wound clean at all times, avoiding oiliness, dirt, and not allowing pus to accumulate.
For pus, when it collects on the membrane of the brain, corrupts and inflames it, causing great harm to the patient. It may also appear in the back of the head, especially if its treatment is neglected.
Blackening of the surface [of an ulcer], if it appears, indicates that the patient has exhibited the symptoms we mentioned. Know then that he is doomed without doubt, and that blackening occurred due to a medication applied to it; that medication had the power to cause such blackening.
It is necessary to take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, mix them well, and use it to stain a cloth. Then place the cloth on the peritoneum [of the abdomen] and treat him with appropriate remedies until he recovers.
Chapter Three.
How to set a broken nose.
Know that the nose does not break except for its upper parts, which are both bones. The lower part is made of cartilage and does not break; instead it suffers from deformity, dislocation, or fracture.
If one of its sides breaks, insert the little finger into the nostril and push the bone back into place with your index finger from inside and thumb from outside until you restore the nose to its natural shape. Do this gently so that you do not cause pain to the patient.
If the break is at the top of the nose and you cannot reach it with your finger, use a thin, slightly thickened rod to push the bone back into place. If both sides are broken, do the same for each side. Perform reduction on the first day after the fracture occurs.
If it is not possible [to reduce the fracture on the first day], do so on the seventh or tenth day after the swelling has subsided. Then insert a wick of cotton into the nostril if one side is broken, or two wicks if both sides are broken.
And let the wick be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some early reducers mention that the wicks should be lubricated with oil and changed daily, but I do not recommend this. Rather, the wicks should be dipped in beaten egg white mixed with flour dust.
Then leave the splint until the bone hardens and the cartilage calcifies, and you may insert into the nose the place of the splint goose feather tubes after wrapping them with soft gauze so that their retention would be stronger and to prevent the patient from breathing difficulty.
And this is not necessary if you wish to do it, and if you wish to make the splints. If during your work there appears a swelling or inflammation in the nose, apply cotton soaked in rose oil or honey and deer fat, or some diacylon ointment.
If no inflammation appears, do not apply anything from outside with semolina flour and almond dough mixed with egg whites, then place a soft compress without binding the nose at all. Otherwise, if the bones of the nose break slightly.
Otherwise, if the bones of the nose are broken or crushed, it is necessary to incise them and extract them with the appropriate instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with appropriate healing ointments. If there is an injury inside the nose, it should be treated with splints and lead pipes used. Until it heals.
Chapter Four
If the lower lip is broken.
If the lower lip is broken without being cut, and if it is only broken externally without being divided into two and becoming displaced internally, its recognition is easy.
If the fracture is on the right side, insert the left hand's index finger into the patient's mouth and if it is on the left side, insert the right hand's index finger. Then gently lift the fracture prominence from inside out with it.
And with your other hand from outside the bone, guide its straightening. If the jawbone fracture has been broken into two pieces, then use a lever from both sides to ensure its proper alignment. If any teeth have been displaced.
Or if teeth have been separated, tie those that you want to remain in place with gold, silver, or brass wire. Then apply cotton soaked in rose oil on the broken lip, then place a folded gauze on it and finally place a tight bandage or a piece of leather strap equal to the length of the lip. Then you bind it above according to what you prefer, securing the bandage until no leakage occurs. You instruct the patient to rest quietly and give them soft, light food. If you notice any change in appearance on any side within three days, hasten to remove it.
Then you bind it above according to what you prefer, securing the bandage until no leakage occurs. You instruct the patient to rest quietly and give them soft, light food. If you notice any change in appearance on any side within three days, hasten to remove it. Then you treat what you have wrapped with flour ground with egg white or fine barley meal after removing the catgut from it. Apply a soft pad on top, leaving it until the bandage adheres to him and no change occurs in the bone's condition.
Do not remove it until the wound heals and the fracture solidifies. Often, this fracture becomes firm within three weeks. If inflammation occurs during this time, apply the previously mentioned remedies repeatedly to subside the swelling until it disappears.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, observe: if any bone fragments have become detached, gently remove them using any suitable instrument. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with scissors according to your need.
Then, after removing those fragments and none remain, suture the mouth of the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for that purpose. And heal the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five
**On Reduction of a Dislocated Shoulder.**
Most commonly, the collarbone fractures at its anterior end near the elbow, and this fracture occurs in one of three directions: either it breaks and splits into two without any fragments, which is the easiest to reduce.
Or it may occur with fragments, which is more difficult to reduce. If the fracture occurs without a wound, prepare two assistants: one to hold the arm that lies next to the fractured collarbone, and another to extend the neck towards the other side.
Then align the fracture with your fingers until it assumes its proper shape, without any displacement or shortening. If you need to extend further, place a ball of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit.
It should fit the size of your need and extend, raise the collarbone, and press the ball with your hand until the fracture aligns correctly. If you are unable to pull the tip of the collarbone outward because it has receded deeply, then the patient should lie on their back.
A moderate-sized pad is placed under the shoulder blade and the servant presses down on it until the recessed collarbone rises above. Then, with your fingers, fix and align the fracture.
If you feel that a fragment of the collarbone has broken off and is moving around, do not cut into it to remove the fragment. If the fragment is stuck in the bone, then change your plan and use one of the prepared saws to cut it. After placing the apparatus that holds the diaphragm beneath the collarbone - this apparatus is made of wood or iron and looks like this:
It resembles a spoon without curvature, its width should match the size of the bone you need to work on, and its length should be suitable for you to operate with. It has two ends, one broader and the other narrower.
If the wound you made to remove the bone fragment is wide and you are confident that there will be no bleeding, then sew the edges of the wound. If it is narrow or if you fear bleeding, then close the wound with stitches and strips according to its size.
If there is heavy bleeding, apply pressure on the wound using rose oil and vinegar or wine. If the bone needs setting without cutting or wounding it, then use a bandage made from flour paste mixed with egg white. Then place the padded sling on it, and put a ball under his armpit if needed. Then take a long strip of cloth, about an inch wide, fold it into a bandage, place it on the sling and dressing, then take a splint made from thin board. The bandage should be three fingers wide and of the same length. Then insert it into a cloth, then insert this cloth with the splint into the appropriate place on the bandage that corresponds to the fracture site. Then tie the bandage around the fracture as tightly as possible. And thus on his neck and under his armpit, both healthy and sick, rubbing it repeatedly on every side. And you have seen that traction corrects the fracture perfectly, something which is not hidden from you.
And all of your understanding should be that the plaster bandage should not be removed from the broken bone. So you should visit the patient every day, for whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the plaster has fallen off, then repair it and tighten the bandage. Then make the patient sleep on his back with a small pillow under his armpit at night.
Raise his arm with it (the pillow) from his side so that the fracture of the collarbone is raised along with the shoulder joint, or tie his arm to his neck. Do not untie the bandage unless there is an incident such as itching or swelling in that place for twelve days.
Then renew the bandage if you see fit to do so. And keep rubbing it (the bandage) until it becomes firm and the fracture of the collarbone solidifies and becomes stronger in twenty-eight days. Some people may take less than that time.
Chapter Six.
Chapter Six: Setting a shoulder fracture. Rarely does the shoulder blade itself break, but rather its angles do. When it breaks at one of its points or in the middle, this is known by touch. According to how the fracture appears, so shall be its reduction.
Set it (the bone) back into its natural shape with whatever means you have available, then apply a poultice of millstone dust mixed with egg whites and linseed oil to the area. Then place a folded cloth bandage on top of that, followed by a wide splint made of wood.
As thin as the shoulder itself or slightly wider. If there is any swelling under the bandage in one of the areas of the shoulder, smooth it out with linseed oil until the bandage lies flat, then tie it all together with a long strip of cloth.
Tie it firmly and make sure the bandage does not move from its place. Check the bandage every day, tightening it whenever it becomes loose. If the bandage falls off, reposition it. The patient should lie on his sound side with his shoulder immobilized for twenty days.
After twenty or twenty-five days, once this period has passed, then cut the suture and you will be safe. It is from the bones which cause no fear of breaking nor concern about their healing. If a splinter of bone protrudes and presses beneath the skin, incise over it and remove it. And perform what was mentioned regarding fracture of the collarbone to alleviate the hot swelling if such a thing occurs.
Chapter Seven
In treating fractures of the chest.
The breastbone may fracture in its middle, but this happens rarely; rather, its extremities are more prone to fracturing and splintering. One of the symptoms of a middle fracture is that it inclines downward and causes severe pain with difficulty breathing and coughing.
And perhaps blood may be coughed up, and the cracking sound in the broken bone is noticeable to the touch. Its treatment involves having the patient lie on their back with a pillow between their shoulders, then pressing down on their elbows and bringing together the ribs with both hands while gently smoothing them out as much as possible.
And continue until the bone returns to its proper shape, then apply a bandage and splint before placing on top of it a light plaster cast made from thin slices of willow or broomstick, wrapped in cloth. Then carefully bind it to the broken bone so that it does not slip off, wrap the bandage around the back in a circular motion several times and tie it gently, then check the bandage regularly, tightening it whenever it becomes loose.
And if necessary to remove it due to pain or swelling in the area, then hurry up and remove the bandage, treat whatever has appeared with its appropriate treatment, and then replace the bandage if necessary. Face him [the patient] and keep pulling until it heals.
Chapter Eight
In treating the ribs if they are fractured, know that the fracture of the ribs occurs only in the hard parts that follow the back and their extremities at the front. They are vulnerable to fractures because they are cartilaginous, and this is evident upon examination with the fingers.
She should align the fracture with her fingers on the practiced face until the shape is as it should be, then bandage and secure the broken bone with a splint if necessary. If it's an inward-slanting rib fracture, it will expose the lungs to severe pain.
And like the cough that afflicts those with it, causing the bone to pierce the pleura and leading to difficulty in breathing, coughing up much blood. This is difficult to treat; many remedies have been tried for it.
Some say it is appropriate to make the patient's diet produce wind and gases, causing the abdomen to swell and pushing out the fracture. We disapprove of this, lest it cause a hot swelling if none has occurred, or worsen it if one already exists.
Some advise placing a cup on the site and applying suction, similar to cupping except that one fears the cup may adhere due to its weakness. Others say it is appropriate to cover the site with wool soaked in hot oil.
The space between the ribs becomes filled so that the bandage is level when wrapped around, then treat the cough with appropriate food and medicine. If the patient's condition is severe and unbearable, however... It was feared that the bone would pierce the pleura, causing harm to the patient. Therefore, it is appropriate to cut open the site and expose the broken rib, then place beneath it the apparatus for protecting the abdomen that has been mentioned earlier, and gently cut and remove the bone.
Then, if the wound is large, close it with stitches and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling appears during this time, quickly apply warm compresses made of rose oil to the site, and also treat the patient internally with remedies that alleviate swellings.
He should lie on the side where sleep is easier until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
How to set dislocated vertebrae and neck.
If the neck or spine suffers a fracture, which rarely happens, and more commonly a dislocation (luxation) occurs. To determine whether it has healed... If you see that his hands have become paralyzed and numb, lifeless and unable to move or stretch out or close, and if he does not feel any pain when pricked with a needle, then know that recovery is unlikely in most cases; he is lost.
If he can move them and feels pain upon pricking or pressing, know that the marrow of his bones is unharmed and that the patient may recover with treatment. However, if this condition affects the spine, you should determine whether recovery is possible.
If you examine his legs, and find that they have become paralyzed just like his hands, then if he lies on his back wind and feces escape without control, and if he lies on his stomach urine escapes without control. If he lies on his back and cannot control urine, know that he is beyond hope; do not bother with treatment. However, if this does not happen, the condition is less severe. Treat it by applying a poultice to soothe the hot swelling.
Apply rose oil alone or with burned garlic cloves to the affected area three times a day until the inflammation subsides. Then apply a wet compress and bind it tightly, instructing him to remain still and quiet.
He should sleep only on the side that does not cause him pain until he recovers. If a bone fragment or foreign body has entered during birth and healed, do not cut into the skin to remove it. Then close the wound with stitches if it is large, and treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the last vertebra of the spine has broken off (the tailbone), do not insert your left thumb into the anus.
Set the broken bone with your other hand as much as possible, then apply a splint and bandage if necessary, binding it tightly.
If you feel a broken bone fragment inside, cut into the wound, remove it, and treat the injury as described previously until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
Force bone fracture in hip joint.
Most cases of hip joint fractures heal well. However, if it does happen, the fracture will be such that the ends of the bone shatter and crack lengthwise, causing the limb to lean inward and expose the sciatic nerve to pain and numbness in the affected leg.
If a fracture occurs, run your hand over it until you reach the break. If the ends of the bone are shattered only at their tips, align them according to what seems fit until they resemble their natural shape.
If the fracture runs lengthwise or has leaned inward, lay the patient on their stomach to align the bone. Once aligned, apply a splint and then place a wooden or leather bandage, securing it with binding.
Do not fear displacement of the fracture or loosening of the bandage. Fill in any gaps between the toes with material to ensure even pressure and prevent discomfort. Have the patient sleep on their back or unaffected side, if swelling occurs.
Stop compressing the fracture and align it until the swelling subsides. Apply a dressing to alleviate discomfort, as mentioned earlier. Then return to aligning and securing the fracture with binding, but do not attempt to remove any bone fragments or chips at its ends.
Do not touch it but align it from outside as mentioned before, leaving it bound until it heals.
Chapter Eleven
On the reduction of fractures of the arm.
The elbow is between the elbow joint and the shoulder joint. If fractured, reduce it in one of two ways: take a smooth, well-polished piece of wood like this:
And tie the ends with ropes. Then suspend it from an elevated point, have the patient sit on a chair and place their fractured arm over the wooden bar so that their armpit touches its center of curvature. Then hang something heavy from above to immobilize the arm.
Or, a servant can extend it downward while the physician manually reduces the fracture with both hands until the bone returns to its proper position. Alternatively, the patient can lie on their back and hang their arm from their neck using a rope.
Then order two servants: one to hold above the fracture with his hands, and another to hold below it and extend each towards his side. And if you wish for stronger traction, tie beneath the fracture with a bandage and above it with another, and then extend each from their sides by the servants.
If the fracture is close to the elbow, it is preferable for one bandage to be placed under the armpit and the other under the fracture near the forearm. Similarly, if the fracture is near the wrist, the bandages should be placed on that spot and on the wrist itself.
Then gently align the fracture without force until it fits properly and heals well. Then, if there is no hot swelling, tighten it; but if there is hot swelling, leave it untightened for seven days, then apply a compress of moistened lint soaked in vinegar and anointed with rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then tighten it. The method of tightening is: lay a pad on the fracture, then wrap a fresh cloth around the pad, bring the arm to rest on its own upper arm and place the hand flat on the elbow.
And wrap the cloth and the bandage around the upper arm and forearm, so that the arm acts as a splint if there is no impediment preventing this. If you fear any change in the bone, then use splints.
This is to place a plaster on the fracture itself, wider and stronger than other plasters. Leave one finger's width between each plaster, and make the length of the plasters according to the fracture plus three fingers' width from both sides.
Then tighten the splints with the bandage mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And make your tightening on the site of the fracture stronger.
The further from the fracture, the less tight should be the bandage. If you see that setting the splints and bandaging at this time is appropriate for your patient's condition, do so accordingly.
If you fear hot swelling, leave the bandage and splints for seven days as mentioned earlier. Then examine the bandage every three days to ensure that there is no irritation or swelling at the site, nor restriction of blood flow to the limb due to excessive tightness. All this should be done as described previously.
If you are confident that nothing will happen, then do not cut the ligature except after many days. The patient should lie on his back with his hand on his abdomen, and a bolster filled with wool, moderate in size, should be placed under his armpit.
And examine at all times, day or night, lest the shape of the broken limb should change or the ligature should relax, and then set it right with your own effort. And make the patient's food according to what has been mentioned, so that it is soft at first, until the bone begins to harden.
It is not permissible to make the patient's food coarse, for it is customary for the arm and leg to harden in forty days. At that time, it becomes necessary to cut the ligature, use the bathhouse, and treat with appropriate ointments, especially if the fracture is comminuted.
Do not remove the ligature until fifty days have passed or two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On Setting Fractures of the Arm.
The arm consists of two bones, the radius and ulna. One is called 'the small bone', which lies next to the thumb, while the other is called 'the large bone' which underlies it from below. Sometimes only the larger bone may be fractured, or sometimes only the smaller one, and sometimes both.
When the upper end of the radius is fractured, its reduction is easy and its exposure is swift. But when the lower end of the ulna is fractured, its reduction is difficult and its exposure is slow, and most difficult of all if both bones are fractured.
It is necessary for the physician, when reducing the fracture, to do so gently and easily until it is aligned. If the ulna is the fractured bone, he should apply more pressure. But if both bones are fractured, he must exert great force.
It is necessary to place the hand in the correct position during reduction, with the arm extended on a pillow. The thumb should be elevated above all the fingers and the little finger should be lower than the others. The patient should sit upright.
The pillow should be at his level to prevent discomfort for the patient.
Then a servant stretches the arm from below, either by hand or with a bandage, and another servant does likewise from above. The doctor then aligns the bone until it is properly repositioned; if there are any splintered fragments, they should be removed.
If any fragment remains out of place, try to return it. If there is an exposed splinter that cannot be reduced and is piercing the skin, make an incision over it and extract it according to the method described earlier. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, this case has its own chapter.
Then, take treatment from there. If swelling and heat appear at the start of reduction, apply a compress made of cotton soaked in a mixture of rose oil and white wax; it should be moderate between thickness and softness. Apply it gently until the swelling subsides.
Then remove the cotton and apply the prepared bandage made from wheat flour and egg white. Apply the splints, ensuring that the one on the fracture itself is slightly broader and stronger. Know that in most cases there are six splints for the arm.
If the fracture is in one elbow or both elbows, tie the bandage tightly and firmly at the site of the fracture. Whenever you wrap the bandage upwards or downwards, make it slightly looser than mentioned earlier.
And let the bandage that is wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, not too firm. The thread used to tie it should be made of cotton, moderate between fineness and coarseness as described earlier. Examine the limb and its ligaments after some days.
If something needs to be corrected, such as itching that appears on the limb, do not immerse the limb in warm water until the itching subsides. Leave the limb loose overnight so that it may rest, then resume binding.
If the bandage has loosened and the bone has shifted or something similar has occurred, fix it all as much as possible. Also, if nourishment is not reaching the limb due to excessive tightness, loosen the bandage slightly for a few days until nutrition reaches it, then reapply.
If no improvement is seen by the patient regarding what we have mentioned, it is not permissible to remove [the splint] except after twenty days or thereabouts. Then tie the patient's hand to his neck, let his arm be balanced and he should avoid sudden movements, and let him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture of the arm is healed in thirty days or forty-three days, and perhaps it may heal in twenty-eight days, all according to the conditions of temperaments [humors] and strengths.
Chapter Thirteen.
In setting fractures of the hand and fingers.
Fractures of the palm and dislocations of the fingers are rarely seen, but contusions are common. Therefore, if a fracture or contusion occurs in the palm...
It is necessary for the patient to sit cross-legged with two chairs placed flat before him.
Then he places his hand on it [the chair] extended, then the servant of bonesetter stretches it out and the physician aligns it until it unites nicely. Then at this point, it is necessary to apply a splint and bandage if there is no heat present in the swelling. After that, a plaster cast is applied according to the location.
And having wrapped it in a soft cloth, if the fracture is towards the palm of the hand, make a ball-like shape out of the cloth and command the patient to grip it with his fractured hand. Then pull it with a long cloth.
And let the plaster cast be of soft leather that can conform to the skin while allowing full flexion of the hand. If the fracture is on the outside, then make a plaster cast from above and another from below the hand to keep it elevated and open.
Then apply the traction as the hand rotates and tie it between the fingers. If the fracture is in one of the phalanges, if it is the thumb, align it properly then bind it with the hand. If you wish to make a small plaster cast for it to keep the fracture in place.
And do not move him. If the fracture is in one of the other fingers, such as the middle, index, ring or little finger, align it and bind it with the neighboring finger that is straight or bind all of them together on a splint which is better, or place a small plaster cast on it.
As we have mentioned regarding the thumb, examine it frequently; apply pressure after it becomes hot and swollen. Then treat it as appropriate when such a condition occurs, as has been repeatedly described.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
In setting fractures of the thigh.
The thighbone often breaks and it is felt because it twists forward and backward. Its reduction should be done by pulling one ligament above the fracture and another below it, with the patient lying on his face.
Then, every assistant ligament should be extended towards its side gently, if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. But if it is near the hip, a stronger ligament made of wool or similar material should be used to pull.
At the hip's origin towards the pubis, one ligament should be pulled upwards and the other below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the ligament should be close to the knee with the pull directed downwards. Then, the physician should adjust the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural shape.
The bone should be well set. Then, the splint and bandage should be applied. If there is no heat in the limb, then apply them immediately. But if there is heat, leave it alone until the heat subsides, then return to treatment.
As for binding it, a wide, stiff bandage should be wound around it twice or thrice without touching the fracture. Then, twist the leg until the heel is at the hip's root, and insert a long thread between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, with both ends of the thread above.
Then, wind the remaining bandage around both the leg and thigh. Place splints on the thigh at the fracture site and make them into one splint for the leg bone. Then, stuff the gap between the thigh and leg with soft cloth to distribute the tension evenly.
Then, begin strong pulling from the middle towards the fracture site with three or four turns. As you move away from the fracture, make your pulls lighter and gentler.
Then proceed to the ends of the thread which you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie it with what is adjacent from above, then pass its end downward until it reaches the man's anus, then also draw tight both ends of the sutures from the other side.
Lest the suture slip from its place, then leave it untied until there is no talk of inflammation or swelling or edema etc., for if anything of that occurs, hasten to release it and repair whatever has happened thereof as mentioned previously.
But if there is a splinter in the bone that has become embedded, then do not attempt to reduce it if you are able; otherwise, cut upon it and extract it, and treat the wound as mentioned previously until it heals. This fracture may also cause stiffness of the thigh without any sutures being added to the leg.
As mentioned regarding the shoulder and arm, except that if it is dislocated thus, it does not expose its owner to lameness unless it becomes dislocated by itself without being accompanied by the leg, in which case its owner must always limp.
Know that the thigh regains its strength in fifty days or somewhat more or less, all according to varying constitutions and other circumstances.
Chapter Fifteen.
On fractures of the patella.
The patella is rarely fractured but often dislocated. If it is fractured, it may be either cracked or split into pieces, with or without accompanying wound.
Examine all this by touch, and reduce the fragments of the patella with your fingers until they meet and fit properly according to your ability to reduce, gentle manipulation, and skill. Then apply a bandage and splint if necessary.
Tie above the site of fracture, and then observe all conditions mentioned regarding other fractures such as heat and inflammation etc., treating each appropriately until healing is complete.
Chapter Sixteen.
On setting fractures of the leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick called the tibia and the other thin called the fibula; they are subject to various types of fractures similar to those of the arm bones. Therefore, its treatment is like the treatment of an arm fracture, as the work is one. If all the bones are broken, the leg will be dislocated in all directions. If only the thinner bone is broken, the leg will be dislocated forward. And if only the thicker bone is broken from below, this is something that should not escape your notice.
Apply traction and alignment, and bind the fractures accordingly, unless in case of a severe fracture of the leg with many splinters, where traction should be lighter and gentler.
After aligning the fractures and completing your work on the leg, take two pieces of pine wood, which are used to flatten the spaces between the cracks in boards or can be made from date palm leaves.
Select two pieces that are slightly thick and not too thin, their length being equal to the length of the leg from the knee to the ankle. Then wrap each one with a cloth twice its length and place one on either side of the leg.
Let them extend from the knee to below the foot, then tie the two pieces at three points on both ends and in the middle. With this binding, the leg will be prevented from swaying left or right and will remain steadfastly fixed. A measuring rod made of wood along the length of the leg may also be used.
Place the splint to keep it still, especially if there is an accompanying wound. Then check the leg every day and pay careful attention to any swelling or inflammation, or other complications. When such things occur, treat them appropriately until recovery. The bone of the leg is usually set in about thirty days or thereabouts.
Chapter Seventeen
On fractures of the bones of the leg and toes
As for the heel, it never fractures. However, bones of the leg may sometimes fracture, while the toes rarely do; they are more often dislocated.
If there is a fracture in the bones of the leg and you see that some of them are protruding towards each other, have the patient stand with their foot flat on the ground like walking. Then step on what has risen above the fractured bones and press down to align them.
Until it returns to its place, then take the bandage and splint from above and place them beneath the foot on a small board with two flattened ends. Then bind the foot firmly with it after wrapping it with cloth and whatever else is needed.
If three or four days have passed, then release the bandage. If you find that bones which were broken or dislocated are now aligned, proceed as follows: if some of the fingers are fractured, straighten and align them according to the method I described for setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the fractured finger along its length, slightly wider than it. Then place this board under the foot and bind it firmly if two or three or more bones are broken.
Make a splint for each finger according to its size, sloping and wrapped in soft cloth. Bind the board under the foot, ensuring that each of its ends rests outside the sole of the foot for proper alignment.
And remember to apply all that has been mentioned regarding signs and their corresponding treatments in other fractures as well.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of the woman's pelvis and pubis bone, and that of the man.
When the woman's pelvis is fractured, make her sit up and lean her back gently towards a pillow. Then have a midwife pack cotton into her vagina until it is full and forms a ball inside.
Then shake the woman gently and lift her hips slightly. The cotton will come out until it is at the vaginal opening like a ball, and the bone will be reduced. Then place a support on her back. Whenever she wants to urinate, remove the cotton gently so that she can.
And return it to its original position, then resume the support for seven days or so until it heals. If you wish, you can use a sheep's bladder: attach a tube made of hollow reed to its mouth and insert the entire bladder into the vagina.
Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder inflates within the vagina. If the fracture is recent, fill it with cotton and apply what we have described until it heals. As for when the bone of the pubis in a man or woman breaks, this is how it is treated.
And treat it as we described for fractures of the hip bone. You are not unaware of the correctness in these rare and unusual fractures, especially if you have some experience and understand this book. Indeed, the fracture itself indicates what should be done in most cases.
If you follow the correct path in treating and reducing it, you will understand. As for when a man breaks his thigh bone near the hip joint, insert the penis into the fracture site, then place a bandage of cloth over it, secure it, and leave it alone for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen
On reduction of bone fractures accompanied by wounds
If someone suffers a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if it is a large bone such as the thighbone or armbone, he should hurry to separate himself from it at once, provided that the conditions for bloodletting are present, as mentioned earlier.
If the wound is bleeding profusely, it is necessary to immediately cauterize it with powdered vitriol if nothing else is available. Then proceed with reducing the fracture on that same day without delay.
If no inflammation occurs, wait until the ninth day to reduce the fracture. But if inflammation does occur, leave reduction until it subsides and do not approach the patient on the third or fourth day, for he may then exhibit bad symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin, gently push it back and align it using your hands with slight traction. If you are unable to do so manually, use this apparatus made of iron, which should be about seven or eight fingers long. Adjust its size according to the wound's measurement.
Therefore, the physician should prepare three or four of these apparatuses in various sizes according to his needs for treating different types of fractures. They should be made slightly thick so they do not bend during use.
The tip is sharp with a bend at its end; it extends upwards towards the thick part and below is very slender.
This instrument is called 'perem' in Greek, meaning a small lever. It should not be used with its sharp end pointing towards the protruding bone tip, and one should press it gently until the bone returns to some extent of straightness so that the edges of the fracture align with each other.
If its broken end is thin and the instrument did not grasp it properly, then do not cut off that bone tip until the instrument can take hold of it. If you are still unable to reduce the bone as described earlier, then cut it with a similar instrument to those mentioned.
Or, if possible, use one of the saws to cut it. Then clean up any remaining roughness and splinters on the bone. If you find that after reducing the bone there is severe pain, then know that the bone has not been properly reduced.
If you are able to properly reduce the bone, then do so as this will greatly benefit the patient. Once the bone has been set, dip a bandage in astringent black syrup and apply it, especially if it is summer. Do not use any greasy substance on the wound.
To prevent it from becoming foul and decaying, then apply plaster casts immediately after reducing the bone. Leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandage that is equal to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to tighten the wound with the fracture, as many ignorant doctors have done this causing either death or lame limbs for their patients. Therefore, let your bandage be loose and relaxed unlike the tightening used in other fractures.
If the wound is bad or large and you fear some of the bad symptoms that were described, or if there is persistent pain in the area, then do not apply plaster casts. Instead, make bandages from strong cloth and bind it tightly with them.
If after a day or two you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, then remove the bandage soaked in syrup. Then apply lint and ointments such as the quadruple ointment, etc., as is customary for treating wounds. You should also loosen the bandage.
Inspect the wound every morning and evening until it heals and clears up. It is advisable to elevate the limb so that pus drains downward easily. If many days pass and the wound does not adhere or stop draining, know that there are small bone fragments remaining.
It is necessary to search the wound with forceps, and if any of those fragments are unhealed, remove them and extract them. If any remain unhealed and are hurting the limb, cut them and remove them in whatever way you can.
If there is swelling, inflammation, or any other type of corruption and foulness in the wound, it is necessary to treat each case with its corresponding treatment as described in its chapter.
And know that if a large bone is broken and exposed to the limb, such as the thighbone or armbone and other major limbs, do not attempt to extract it. For often death results from attempting this, so leave it alone until it rots, for perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you find a place suitable for treatment; otherwise, leave it alone.
Chapter Twenty.
On treating complications that arise after some fractures.
This complication often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially those near joints, distorting the shape of the limb and perhaps preventing it from functioning normally.
If the complication is fresh, use astringent medications such as tragacanth, myrrh, aloe, and gum arabic, among others. Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent liquid, egg white, or vinegar.
And apply this mixture to the complication with pressure, tying it securely and leaving it untied for several days before removing it and repeating the process until the complication subsides, if Allah wills. Or you may secure a copper plate tightly over it.
For copper has a property that removes all that is exposed in the limbs. If the complication has become hard and severe, and it becomes necessary to remove it, cut off its upper part or scrape away the excess flesh using forceps until it disappears. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One
In treating fractures, if the limb becomes thin after healing, and remains so abnormally afterwards
If a bone fracture becomes thinner and weaker after healing, it may be due to many reasons. One of these reasons might be either excessive weakening and improper tightening of ligaments, or overly tightening them to the point that nutrients cannot reach the limb, or excessive trembling, or movements at inappropriate times, or a lack of blood in the patient's body and weakness.
And its treatment is to nourish the patient and enrich his body until blood increases in him, and to use baths and bring happiness upon him, then apply warm wax on the limb to draw much nutrition towards it or to reduce trembling with lukewarm water. Until nutrients are increased therein and it returns to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-Two
In treating crookedly healed broken bones that have lost their proper function
When a limb has healed crookedly or with a twist after a bone fracture, causing deformity and ugliness in the appearance of that limb But if the limb has not lost its natural function, then it is not permissible to accept the claim of those who say that the bone should be broken again. Many ignorant physicians and bonesetters in our land do this.
This action is highly reprehensible and leads to great harm, but if the deformity and complexity are recent, then it is permissible to reduce them using water in which softening herbs such as papyrus leaves, comfrey roots, and marsh mallow have been boiled.
And it should be bandaged with softening dressings such as well-prepared diacanthum, or papyrus sap mixed with chicken fat and sheep suet, or dates mixed with pigeon dung, and other dissolving remedies.
And if the complexity persists despite this, then gentle and continuous massage should be employed using hands, along with movements of the limb in all directions at all times. But if the deformity has become firm and hardened and its treatment requires iron.
It is necessary to incise above and release the bone's attachment, cut what remains of the bone or complication with gentle cuts, employing gentleness in this with effort and care. Then treat the wound as mentioned earlier until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three
When one of the jaws dislocates, it causes pain and severe discomfort to the patient. Therefore, it is imperative to reduce it immediately.
Do not delay it at all, for if delayed, the area will swell and reduction of the jaw becomes difficult. Therefore, do not move or extend it while it is swollen as this often causes harmful sprains and pain to the patient.
However, if it occurs, proceed with bloodletting the patient first, then allow the swelling to subside a little. Then manipulate the joint with warm water and oil, gently reduce it, and treat each part according to what is mentioned in its place.
And the sections on the jaws are arranged similarly from the top of the body downwards as discussed under fractures.
Chapter Twenty-Four
On treating the lower jawbone.
Rarely do the jaws dislocate except in few cases, and when they do, it happens in one of two ways: either they slip out of their places slightly and remain relatively relaxed, or they completely dislocate and become fully relaxed. If they dislocate to the extent of the chest, saliva flows from the patient's mouth, and he is unable to keep it in or clench his teeth together. If he speaks, his tongue stumbles. But if it is a slight dislocation, he can often reduce it himself with ease.
But if the dislocation is complete, do not rush to reduce it quickly and do not delay it at all. If the dislocation is on one side only, a servant should hold the patient's head while the physician inserts the index finger of one hand into the origin of the jaw inside the mouth.
Or, if the dislocation is on both sides, the physician should insert both thumbs into the mouth while using the other fingers from outside to align it. Then he should instruct the patient to relax his jaw and move it towards each side while gently guiding the jaw back into its place.
If it is difficult to reduce (the jaw), especially if all the joints are affected, then use medicament with hot water and oil until they can be easily reduced. Do not delay their reduction at all, as previously mentioned. When they have returned to their normal position and the patient's mouth has closed without being relaxed, then place wicks soaked in a preparation made from wax, oil, and rosewater on them.
Then tie it gently with a relaxed bandage, ensuring the patient lies on their back with their head elevated between two pillows to prevent movement neither to the right nor left and to avoid chewing solid food; instead, they should consume soft, liquid nourishment.
Until the pain has subsided and the jaw is healed, let him eat whatever he desires. He should open his mouth gently for eating, drinking, and yawning to ensure that the jaw remains healed.
If the jaw is difficult to reduce and has dislocated at some point without returning to its usual position, then constant feverishness, headaches, abdominal pain, or repeated vomiting may occur. If you observe these symptoms, know that it is severe (i.e., the dislocation is serious).
And many die from this condition within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Fifth.
On reducing a dislocated jaw and shoulder blade
As for the collarbone, it does not dislocate inwardly due to its connection with the chest. However, it can dislocate outwardly and this is noticeable by touch. To reduce it, the patient should lie on their back with their arms extended.
Then press the dislocation with your hand firmly until it returns into place. Then apply a bandage and wicks, and secure them. The end of the collarbone near the shoulder blade rarely dislocates; if it does, do not attempt to reduce it as described above.
Then apply a bandage, wicks, and secure them. Order the patient to remain quiet until healed. The same treatment is used to reduce a dislocated shoulder blade.
Chapter Twenty-Six
On dislocation of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder blade dislocates in three ways: one towards the armpit downwards, another towards the chest, and sometimes it dislocates upwards beyond the shoulder blade, which happens rarely.
It does not dislocate backwards behind the shoulder blade nor forwards near the nerve, and it commonly dislocates and exits downwards towards the armpit, especially in those with little flesh as it comes out quickly and enters swiftly.
As for those with much flesh, it is different; it comes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty. Sometimes a person may receive a blow or fall and the shoulder blade swells and becomes hot, leading one to believe that it has dislocated; therefore, it should not be examined until its condition is ascertained.
When this occurs, proceed as follows to treat it: if the dislocation is downwards towards the armpit, bring the dislocated shoulder blade close to the healthy one; you will find a clear difference between them, and you will feel that the head of the shoulder blade is rough. Upon touching under the armpit, you will find the head of the shoulder blade like an egg.
The patient cannot raise their hand to their ear nor move it in all its movements. Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, this will be apparent upon examination and not hidden.
This dislocation can be easily reduced if the shoulder blade is soft or if the patient is a child: have an attendant raise their hand upwards, then place your thumbs under the armpit and lift the dislocated shoulder blade upwards with force until it returns to its place while the attendant raises their hand and extends it upwards.
Then lower the hand downwards; if it returns quickly, if not, and the dislocation has existed for many days, then the patient should not bathe in hot water but should use ointments that relax and soften, such as boiling and mixing the roots of senna and linseed with water.
Then the patient should lie on their back, and a wool ball of moderate firmness should be placed under their armpit. The physician then places their elbow on the ball and holds the patient's hand with theirs, extending it downwards.
He pushes the ball with his foot; it returns to its place. If you wish, return it in this manner: prepare a man taller than the patient, position him at the side of the bed, insert his elbow underneath the armpit of the patient and raise it upwards so that the patient hangs in the air. And another servant pulls the patient's hand downwards towards his abdomen. If the patient is light, do not attach anything else to him lest he be weighed down; otherwise, the fracture will return instantly. It may also be reset in another manner.
And that is, to place on the ground a long plank with a rounded end like the mouth of a mortar, not too thick nor too thin. Then place it under the armpit of the patient after placing a clean cloth on its head while the patient stands along the length of the plank.
Then he extends his hand downwards on the other side and also stretches his body strongly from that side, whereby the joint returns to its place quickly. But if it is difficult to reset using all methods mentioned above, then use this treatment: take a plank about two cubits long. And its width should be about four fingers and thickness like two fingers, with a rounded end to facilitate insertion into the depth of the armpit in this manner:
Then tie a soft cloth on the rounded head of the plank so that it does not hurt the patient. Then place it under the armpit, extend the hand and arm completely downwards along the plank and bind the plank to the forearm and wrist.
Then place the arm on a crossbeam, raise the shoulder and extend the hand downwards while allowing the rest of the body to hang from the other side. When the joint enters completely into its position, then place a moderate-sized ball made of wool under the armpit.
Then bring the prepared plaster made of flour, incense and egg white to the entire shoulder blade as it rotates from above. Then press the ball from under the armpit firmly, rotate the bandage around the plaster from above and tie his hand to his neck.
He should leave his hand unmoved for seven days, and it is necessary that he make the patient's food light until the member strengthens, as this is quicker for its recovery. Then after seven or five days, if it remains steady and has not weakened, movement may be started; if it holds firm without relaxing, then it will have healed.
But if the joint becomes dislocated repeatedly due to wetness or another cause, it is necessary to use cauterization with three sticks of incense as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization. If all this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days but the joint does not remain stable.
If the bandage and tying are repeated several times but it does not remain firm, falls down, and cannot be raised up again, know that its tendon at the top of the elbow has either snapped, stretched, or weakened. Know then that the joint will never remain in place.
As for the dislocation that occurs towards the chest and breast, extending to the back, it should be reduced by pushing and pulling with both hands until it returns. All other methods of traction and treatment may be employed until it heals, but if there is stiffness in the member after healing and slowness in movement.
The patient should use the bath frequently so that the stiffness softens and returns to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Seventh.
On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns to its place with difficulty. It can dislocate in all directions, especially towards the front or back, and its dislocation is obvious both to sight and touch regardless of how it has occurred.
When you compare the dislocated elbow with a normal one, it is clear that the joint appears hollow and the arm cannot be bent or brought to touch the chest. It is necessary to promptly reduce the dislocation before heat and inflammation set in.
If heat and inflammation have already set in, reduction will be difficult and the dislocation may not heal completely, especially if it has occurred towards the back. This is the worst type of dislocation and causes severe pain, often leading to death.
And if it is something that can be reduced, let a servant extend his hand with both hands and arms stretched out, and the doctor's hand from above the elbow and below it, pushing the joint back into place with the thumb of both hands or the base of the hand until it returns to its proper position.
And if the jaw is dislocated forward, it can be reduced by bending the hand repeatedly until striking with the base of the hand against the shoulder next to it. If the jaw does not return to its position, then use great force by having a servant pull on the arm.
And the patient should be held by a servant so that he does not move during traction. Then, the arm is wrapped in a folded cloth or wide bandage and moved to each side after the joint has been reduced with oiled hands for ease of manipulation.
Then, the joint is pushed back forcefully until it returns. After it has returned, a bandage with dough and egg white should be applied to hold it in place tightly. The arm should then be suspended from the patient's neck and left untouched.
If the joint stays in its place, then untie the bandage and leave it. But if the joint does not seem secure, prepare a new bandage and tie it tightly until it becomes firm, then untie it. If there is swelling after reducing the joint, do not tie the bandage.
If there is difficulty in movement, use gentle massage and compression with warm compresses until it becomes soft. Or, place a poultice of fat on the joint, tie it on, and leave it for a day and night before removing it and entering the bath. If he sweats, rub the joint moderately.
Then, apply the poultice again once or twice more with repeated bathing until it becomes soft. If you wish to use a moistened cow's foot with butter and grease applied, do so repeatedly to make it soften and return to its former state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the treatment of wrist dislocation.
The wrist often dislocates and returns, easier than other joints, except that it should be quickly reset at the moment it dislocates to prevent swelling or inflammation.
Place the wrist of the affected arm on a board and extend the patient's hand. The physician should place their palm on the joint and push until it reduces, but they should first ensure that the dislocation has moved back into its proper position.
If the dislocation is prominent on the outer side of the hand, place the inner aspect of the hand on the board so that the physician's palm can reach the joint. If it reduces immediately, apply a cold compress to prevent swelling.
Leave it alone; do not attempt to reduce it again if it does not immediately reduce, as the joint will remain dislocated but cause no harm to the patient unless the hand becomes weak and unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve has been severed or crushed, and there is no treatment for it except to apply pressure with a bandage, which may help or not. After reducing the dislocation, apply the compress we described, then tie it tightly and leave it on for five days.
Then remove the bandage and exercise the hand. If its movement is impaired or there is any stiffness, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it becomes limber.
The Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
On the Treatment of Finger Dislocations.
When a finger dislocates towards any direction, if it dislocates outwards or inwards, extend the finger and push the dislocation back into place with your thumb, then bind the finger's head and suspend it towards the direction it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it aligns properly. Do this daily. If it is bound at night according to the same description, release it during the day, exercise it, and rebind it at night until it regains its strength.
Similarly, if it dislocates inwards towards the palm, bind it accordingly and follow the same procedure until it heals. Do likewise for dislocations in other directions.
Chapter Thirty
In treating locked jaw.
If the jaw becomes dislocated from one of the vertebrae or many of them shift from their places, there is no treatment for it because death will quickly occur to the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's bowels will move without control, and they will not be able to hold them back. Often, some of their limbs, either both legs or arms, or one of them, become paralyzed. But if only one vertebra has shifted from its place, it often goes back into position.
When the dislocation is in any of the four directions, that which dislocates backwards is called a hump. Its treatment is as follows: if the hump has occurred due to old age, there is no treatment for it and it will not recover from it at all. But if it has happened due to a fall or blow or similar cause...
I have mentioned these in previous writings, but I will summarize them here as most of what has been written before is of little benefit. I have clarified and illustrated the instruments more accurately than they were previously described and explained.
I say that the hump which occurs at the front of the chest, there is no treatment for it nor recovery from it. Similarly, those that occur on the sides are also not treatable. Only those that occur in the back can be treated, particularly as I will describe: lay the patient face down.
Place the patient on a flat platform near a wall, with a wet cloth underneath to prevent discomfort to their chest. Then insert a vertical wooden post dug into a hole in the ground at one end of the platform near the patient's head, and another at the opposite end near their feet.
Have a servant hold onto the post near the patient's head, ensuring it is not firmly fixed in the hole. Have another servant hold onto the post at the opposite end. Then wrap a soft, close-fitting cloth around the patient's chest and under their armpits, extending one end of the cloth to the post near their head and tie it there.
Then tie another cloth tightly above the patient's hips, knees, and ankles. Gather all the bindings together and tie them to the post at the patient's feet. Then each servant should pull on their respective posts while ensuring that neither post leaves its dug-in position.
However, these two methods are unproven as we have said. The physician places his hands on the node with force until it returns to its original position or places a board on it and then leans on the board with both knees until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, he takes a board about three arms in length.
He digs into the wall that we have said should be near the patient a place to insert one end of the board, then places the middle of the board on the prominence, and the physician puts his feet on the other end and pulls strongly until the nodes creak.
And it returns to its place. If you wish, you may use a screw that is turned by hand; this involves inserting two stakes into the ground at the head of the patient's bed, each about an arm in length, and two more stakes at his feet.
Let there be about a span between each stake, and make a hole in each stake for the screw to pass through. Secure the stakes firmly in the ground so that they do not move at all. Then insert a wooden dowel, which is the screw that will be used to twist the band.
At one end of the screw, secure a wooden dowel about a span long that can be twisted. Do likewise for the other two stakes. Then attach the band that you have tied at the patient's chest to the screw at his head and the bands you have tied on his legs to the screws at his feet.
Then, at each screw, a servant stands and turns the handle that rotates the screw. The physician straightens the prominence as we have described. Here is an illustration of the screw, the bed, and the patient:
After the prominence returns and the position is straightened, you should then apply a dressing made of gauze soaked in egg white. Then apply a compress, followed by a bandage made from a board that is three fingers wide or more, and its length should be equal to the size of the prominence.
Then bind it with a bandage that should be used, and let the patient consume soft foods until he recovers. If there is still some hardness remaining at the site after recovery, then you should use ointments that relax and soften along with the use of the board we have described for an extended period.
A lead plate may be used for this purpose, but it is not recommended to use it at the end of the spinal cord as it might cause a fracture which could be an extraneous bone growth. Do not attempt this treatment lest death should occur.
The Thirty-First Chapter.
In treating a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip and shoulder joints are only subject to dislocation, unlike other joints which can also suffer from slight displacement or subluxation. The hip joint may dislocate in four ways.
This dislocation occurs inwardly, outwardly, forwardly or backwardly. The most common is inward dislocation, while forward and backward dislocations are less frequent. A sign of inward dislocation is that the healthy leg appears longer when compared to the affected leg.
The knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their leg at the hip. The area around the buttock will feel warm and swollen due to the dislocation of the femoral head.
The signs of outward dislocation are opposite to those of inward dislocation. For forward dislocation, the patient can extend their leg completely but cannot bend it without pain at the knee, making walking difficult.
For backward dislocation, urine and feces are retained, the buttock is tender, and the patient walks on their heel. The signs of backward dislocation include an inability to extend or bend the knee before bending the hip, with the affected leg appearing shorter than the other.
The hip is relaxed, and the femoral head is located at the sciatic notch. If a dislocation has occurred in the past without attempted reduction and remains untreated, there is no cure for it.
If an old dislocation is discovered, it should not be attempted to reduce. However, if a recent dislocation of any kind has occurred, the joint should be gently manipulated and moved inwardly, outwardly, leftward and rightward until reduction is achieved.
If reduction is not achieved through gentle manipulation, then a strong assistant should be summoned to extend the leg from below using both hands or a bandage tied above the knee. Another assistant should help by pushing from above.
That he should enter his hands under his armpits, then pull a soft bandage over the thigh root and have another servant hold its end; it may be stretched either from front towards the chest or from behind towards the back.
And all of them are stretched together in one motion until the patient's body is raised from the ground and remains suspended. This type of stretching is common to all four kinds, but if the jaw does not return as mentioned earlier, each kind requires its own specific treatment.
As for its specific treatment, if the jaw is turned inward, the patient should lie on his healthy side, and a bandage should be tied over the thigh root between the hip head and the area under the armpit.
Then the bandage is stretched upwards from under the armpit towards the chest, and another strong servant aids by holding with his arms the thick part of the sick thigh and pulls it out strongly until it returns to its place.
This method is easier than other treatments used to reset this limb. If it proves difficult and you are unable to attempt this type of treatment, then tie the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage over the heels and knees.
The bandage should be about four fingers wide, and the sick leg should be extended two fingers more than the other. Then suspend the patient from a beam in the house, with his feet about two cubits above the ground.
Then order a strong servant to hold the hip head and another servant to suspend the patient. Push the servant holding the hip with force, and the joint will quickly return to its place. As for its specific treatment if the jaw is turned outward...
The patient should lie on the couch as described earlier for those with a hump. Tie the bandage around his sick leg and chest, then place one beam under his legs and another under his head. Place an additional beam securely in the middle of the couch.
Wet cloths should be wrapped around it so that they do not harm the patient. The beam should be placed between his thighs to prevent him from slipping down during stretching. Then each servant pulls in his direction, while the doctor uses his hands to align the hip joint if it returns.
Otherwise, place the board upon it and press firmly as mentioned in the arch, until the patient is lying on his sound side. If the dislocation is towards the front, then extend the patient's leg slightly while remaining in this position on the couch.
The physician places his right hand upon the injured hip, then presses it with the other hand while maintaining continuous pressure downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is towards the back, the patient should not be extended downwards.
He should be elevated off the ground, rather he should be placed on something solid. Likewise, his dislocated hip should be external rotated according to the description of his position on the couch while facing downwards with the straps tightened.
As previously mentioned, pressure with the board should also be applied to the point where the joint has protruded. Once the hip joint has been properly reduced and its sign is evident (extension of the leg),
If you observe that both hips are level and the patient can bend and straighten their leg without difficulty, know that the joint has been properly reduced. Then bind the thighs together and apply a bandage, tying it firmly to prevent any movement of the hip in either direction.
The patient should remain at rest for three to four days, then the bandage and splint should be removed and the leg should be gently moved. If both hips appear equal in height, then know that the dislocation has been fixed and the patient may begin walking. However, if there is any laxity,
then return and bind it again as before, leaving it on for three more days. Then remove it and allow the patient to walk slowly until they regain their strength, God willing.
Chapter Two and Thirty.
On treating dislocation of the knee joint.
The kneecap dislocates in three directions: inwards, outwards, and downwards (towards the back), but it does not dislocate forwards. The sign of dislocation is that the patient is unable to bring their thigh towards their knee.
If the wound does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. Then, make the patient sit with his legs extended if he has the strength to do so, and have a servant sit behind him to hold his waist and gently pull him backwards. Then, sit on the patient's thighs.
And press your back against his face, place his leg between yours, then grasp his knee with both hands and interlock your fingers on it. Then squeeze the sides of his knee firmly with your hands while another servant presses his foot until the kneecap returns to its place.
The sign that it has returned is when the leg adheres to the thigh smoothly and without resistance. Then, dress it and bind the leg to the thigh with a bandage for three or four days, after which release them. Do not allow him to walk much until he regains his strength.
However, if you are unable to return it using the method described above, then apply strong traction using the apparatus mentioned earlier for dislocated hips until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In treating an ankle fracture.
The heel may simply slip out of place or be completely dislocated, with the fracture occurring either internally or externally. The sign of dislocation is that the heel appears swollen and prominent on the side towards which it has shifted.
However, if it has slipped out of place, it is easy to reduce by gently extending the foot and pushing until it returns. But if it has been completely dislocated, the patient should sit with his legs extended while a strong servant holds him firmly from behind at the waist.
Then, grasp the foot with your right hand at its upper part and with your left hand at its lower part near the ankle. Pull the foot towards you with your right hand twice, then extend it with your left hand and push the front of the foot gently towards the leg with your right hand.
Repeat this process twice as described, then push the front of the foot towards the leg for the third time while simultaneously pulling on the ankle. If it returns in one or two attempts and the foot appears straight, do not repeat the procedure.
If its return (the flow of urine) is prevented as we have described, then lay the patient on their back on the ground. Secure a peg and drive it firmly into the ground so that it falls between their thighs. Wrap the patient in cloth to prevent them from being harmed, then adjust the servant's thigh.
Then another servant extends the patient's leg, either by hand or using a rope tied around the patient's neck. Then each servant pulls while the other holds firm, ensuring that the patient's body does not slip downwards. The physician then straightens the joint with his hands.
And another servant holds the healthy leg down so that the joint returns quickly. Once the joint has returned and its soundness is confirmed, then lift the splint and strap it tightly using bindings. Tie the foot downwards, ensuring to avoid the nerve located above the heel from behind.
So that the binding is not too tight and harms him. Then leave it for two or three days; if the binding has loosened, then tighten it again on the third or fourth day, and do not allow the patient to walk for forty days.
For if the patient tries to walk before this period, it is not certain that the joint will not dislocate and become ruined, and it will not accept treatment afterwards. If he develops an inflammatory swelling, then do not use any of the remedies we have mentioned for its treatment or reduction except in other cases.
Chapter Forty-three.
In treating the dislocation of a toe joint.
It is necessary to gently straighten what has been dislocated without force, as this is not difficult but easy. If the joint is in some toes of the back of the foot, then place the patient's foot on a level spot on the ground.
Or place it on a board while standing as if walking, then step on the protruding part of that joint with your foot with force until it returns and becomes straight, without any prominence remaining.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot, with two raised ends that support the entire foot. Secure it tightly using bandages for three days, then remove and immobilize him from walking for many days until it becomes strong and its return is secure, if God wills.
Chapter Thirty-Five
In types of the jaw that occurs with wound or with fracture or with both together.
When such a thing happens and its treatment is delayed, death often ensues.
Therefore, one should only undertake treating such cases if they are skilled and experienced, compassionate, careful, not hasty nor reckless. Initially, they should use remedies that alleviate hot swellings only, and then leave the patient alone.
O Allah, grant healing only if You will for good, with ease in sickness and hope of recovery. So relieve him from the beginning before the hot swelling appears.
If the bone returns to its place, use remedies that alleviate hot swellings and treat the wound with suitable dry ointments. If the jaw is fractured with splinters protruding, remove them. And follow what was mentioned earlier regarding simple fractures in their respective places.
Strive diligently and keep yourself away from the path of error, as I have previously advised you. This is safer for your reputation and better for your practice, if Allah wills.
