The author of this book has concluded for you, my sons, this part of the knowledge in medicine by its completeness and reaching its aim through its clarity and explanation. I have seen fit to complete it for you with this article which is a part of practical work.
Because manual practice is enhanced in our country and era, it's almost completely absent; to the point that even its study and legacy have been nearly extinguished. Only a few scant remnants remained of it, recorded in early books that have been copied by hands and marred with errors and confusion. As a result, the meanings are obscured and its benefits are diminished.
I saw that I should revive it and compose this article in a path of explanation, detail, and conciseness, providing illustrations for the instruments and all tools of work as they are an enhancement to detail and provide what is needed.
The reason behind this is that there's no skilled artisan with his hands in our time, as the creation of medicine takes a long time and it should be preceded by someone who has mastered the anatomy described by Galen. So that one can understand the benefits of organs, their structure, their conditions, connections and separations, as well as knowledge about bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers, outlets, veins, arteries, lymph nodes, and places of their outlets.
Therefore, it was said that doctors by name are many but actually few, especially in the field of manual work. We have mentioned this point at an entry level in this book.
Because someone who isn't aware of what we've mentioned about anatomy is likely to commit a fatal mistake, as I've seen many people in this science claiming knowledge without actual understanding or expertise.
And that is how I saw a misguided surgeon cut into a pig's growth on the neck of a woman, severing some of her neck arteries, causing her to bleed to death in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who had advanced in extracting a stone from a man who had been stabbed in the kidney. The stone was large, causing panic; he removed it with a piece of bladder tissue. The man died around three days later, and I was called upon to extract it. I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the urine that this situation went beyond my capability.
And I saw another doctor who was living off some of our local military leaders on medicine.
And there was a black slave with him who had broken his leg near the knee along with a wound. The doctor, in haste, bound the broken bone to the wound with ligatures and clamps tightly, depriving the wound of any chance to heal.
Then he indulged in his desires, then left him for days and ordered that the bandage not be removed until his leg and foot swelled and faced certain death.
And I called him, and he quickly removed the bandage, allowing him relief from his suffering. He was able to recover except that the infection had become firmly established in the organ and I could not extract it.
And the infection continued to spread within the organ until death ensued.
And I saw another doctor who applied and removed a cancerous tumor, which blistered after days until it became quite large. This is because when cancer is purely mixed with black masonry, iron should not be exposed to it directly.
Except for a member that can possibly require the removal of all of it.
And so, my sons, it is necessary for you to know that work with the hand divides into two sections: work accompanied by safety and work that often involves difficulty in most cases.
And warnings have been provided in every place where danger and fear are involved, it is necessary for you to be cautious and reject such actions.
So that the ignorant do not find a path to speak and refute, take strength and caution for yourselves, and treat your illnesses with kindness and persistence.
And use the best path leading to safety and commendable outcome, tackle the dangerous and rare illnesses.
And purify yourselves from what you fear might befall you with suspicion in your religion and world, for it remains a cause of concern for you and elevates your status in this world and the hereafter according to your deeds.
Galenus, in some of his instructions, said: Do not treat illnesses of evil; instead, label yourselves as doctors of evil.
This article has been divided into three doors.
The first door.
In the first part, it covers fire and hot weapons, organized from the olden times to the current era. It includes images of machines, tools for striking fire, types of fire-related activities, and everything needed in manual work.
The second door.
In the second part, it covers the cleaving and breaking, puncturing, bleeding and surgery, as well as the removal of arrows among other things. All organized and equipped with images of machines.
The third chapter.
In the field of algebra, amputation and treatment of tumors, and so on, there is a methodically arranged apparatus from century to foot and diagrams of machines.
The first chapter.
In the knee.
And before we discuss its application, it is necessary to describe its purpose, advantages and disadvantages, and in what condition it should be used.
I should say that discussing the method of using the knee, its benefits, and disadvantages is a long, detailed science with secrets known only to wise individuals who have spoken on this topic.
And they differed over it. I have abbreviated their minimal speech for fear of making it too long.
I should say that the knee can benefit in general for any bad mood, accompanied by substance or without it. There are two moods: the hot mood without substance and the moist mood without substance.
However, for the moist mood with substance, they have differed. Some say that the knee is beneficial in this case, while others oppose, stating that the knee is not suitable for a disease resulting from heat and dryness because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible to recover from a hot, moist illness with a hot, moist medicine. The one who says against that argues that the knee can benefit from a hot, dry illness which may occur in humans' bodies. Because if you added the body of a human and its moisture to the mood of fire, you would cool down the body of a human.
And I agree with him because experience has shown me that. However, it is not fitting to imagine this matter without having been satisfied and experienced the path of the knee in a significant way. Stopping to consider the differing moods of people and conditions within themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration of time.
And as for other moods, there is no fear from them for you and especially wet cold diseases; all the physicians agree on it and they do not disagree about its usefulness.
And know, my children, that among the remedies is treatment by fire and its superiority over treatment with burned medicine because fire is a single essence that does not exceed its action on the organ to which it is applied without causing some slight harm to another connected organ.
And treatment with burned medicine may extend its effects beyond the organ and perhaps cause a disease in the organ that is difficult to cure, or maybe even kill. But because of its honor and richness of essence, fire does not do this except when it has been overused.
And we have come to understand this through experience, by the length of service and care in the industry, and by standing on the facts of the matter.
And for this reason, I avoided the length of speech, even though it would not have been fitting for my book to elaborate on secrets about fire and how it acts in bodies and its denial of diseases through philosophical, logical arguments that penetrate your understanding.
And know, my children, that they have differed on the time when it is best to use fire and they considered spring as the best time for its use.
And I say that fire can be used at all times, because the harm caused by time is absorbed in the benefit gained from its use. And especially if the fire is from strong essential injuries that cannot bear delay, for what one fears is that it may be followed by a disaster greater than the harm that comes from time itself.
Do not let yourselves be misled, my sons, by the common opinion and the foolish physicians' assumptions that a disease which is cured will never recur, causing them to blame it.
And it is not as they imagined, that ibness (a type of medicine) is only like a mood-altering medication or a desiccant for moisture which is the cause of pains.
But ibness prefers to medicine in terms of the speed of its success, strength of action, and intensity of its influence.
And the disease may return at some point in time according to the state of the patient and the success and strength of his illness, as well as what accumulates in his body from excesses there and neglecting himself in acquiring foods and such causes.
O Lord, let the disease that ibness is used in be a mild one and in an organ with little excesses or moisture. Like when the tooth causes pain and such, it might be that this pain does not recur, which would at least make things easier.
And as for the general public's claim that ibness is the end of medicine, it is a correct saying against what they say since they believe there is no cure whether with or without medication after experiencing ibness. The situation is contrary to this.
And the meaning of ibness being the end of medicine is simply this: Whenever we have used various treatments for a disease and those medications did not work, then we use the last thing which is ibness and it does work. Thus, from here, ibness can be considered as the end of medicine. Not on the interpretation that the general public and many foolish physicians have come to believe in.
I have mentioned that gold is better than iron for surgery, and they said this because of the balance of gold and its precious essence. They also said it does not rust at the place of surgery, which is not true in fact.
Because I have tried it and found that it only does this in some bodies but not in others. The one done with it is better than iron as they said, except that if you protected the anvil from the fire to heat up with gold, it would not become clear for you when it should reach the temperature needed for heating red-hot the gold piece.
And because it accelerates the heat, and if you increase its fire in the fever, it melts in the fire. And by doing so, the maker becomes distracted from that, thus iron forging became faster and closer to perfection here in god's willing.
This section on the application of gold was organized in chapters from head to foot, making it easier for the student as willing god allows.
The first chapter.
In the head, there is one way of gold application.
This method of gold application helps in overcoming the effects of moisture and cold on the brain, which are two causes of headache and frequent headcold spreading from the head to the eyes and ears area, along with frequent sleeplessness and toothaches, throat pains. In short, for every illness that is caused by cold such as fever, epilepsy, stroke and so on.
The process of this method involves first advising the patient to take the headache relieving medicine for three or four nights, depending on the strength and age of the patient, as well as their routine.
Then he orders him to shave his head like Moses, then make him stand in front of you sitting with his hands on his chest.
Then place the tip of your hand on the tip of his nostril between his eyes. Wherever your middle finger ends, teach that position with the reed pen.
Then heat the oil lamp which is shown here.
If it opens like the size of a skull's head or the size of a tamarind seed, raise your hand. If not, then raise it with the hammer itself or with something else if it cools down. Until you see what was explained to you from the bone, then take some salt and dissolve it in water. Dip a cotton ball into this and place it on the site and leave it for three days.
Then carry out a cotton ball soaked in tallow on him and leave it on him until the smoke disappears from the fire. Then treat him with the four oils until he recovers, if God wills.
And they said that the wound becomes better and more beneficial the longer it stays open, as the pus discharges from it.
Some of them advise to heat the skin up to the bone and keep heating until some of the bone becomes burnt. Then, after that, remove what has been burnt from the bone, and treat accordingly.
Others advise that the heat should be increased until it has a strong effect on the bone, causing parts of it to fall off like a cinder or small piece of coal. They claimed that fumes from this process would emit from that site, leaving the wound open for an extended period.
Then it is treated until it heals, and I do not see these types of blood naturally except in some people. And leaving him with me is better and safer whenever his head doubles when the natural connection separates as we have seen in all other parts.
And especially if the old man's head is naturally weak. The first type of blood has surrendered and it is better for me, I advise using it, so I will operate on it, God willing.
The Second Chapter.
It is also in the head.
If a chronic headache occurs in the skull and this lasts for the old man, use the bleeding techniques, head massages, scalp compressions, hair rinses, ointments, and bandages. Especially if it was the same type of blood we described earlier, and none of these methods helped him, then observe. If the old man's head is structurally strong and not weak, yet he finds severe coldness, then apply another type of blood slightly above that. Then apply blood on each part of his head until the thickness of the skin disappears and reveals the amount of bone as described. And apply blood at the back of his head in the place known as the 'saw', and use gentle force, do not reveal the bone. The old man finds this type of pain extremely severe compared to all other types of headache, I will describe this blood in its appropriate place.
It is necessary that the blood used for the horns and rear of the head be gentler than the blood used on the middle part of the head. This is how it appears.
Chapter Three.
In cases of the sisterly [medical] condition that is not chronic.
If a headache occurs in the skull accompanied by a severe headache spreading to the eye, he should expel phlegm with medicines that cleanse the head and apply all the treatments mentioned in sections of diseases. If this does not work, there are two possibilities for her condition. Either through the use of hot stimulating medicine, or through iron.
If through the use of a hot stimulating medicine, it involves taking a clove of garlic. Peel it and cut off its ends from both sides. Then cut the area of pain with a wide blade until there is a space under the skin that can accommodate the clove.
It is then placed under the skin until it disappears. Then pull on it with a tight string for about fifteen hours, then remove and replace the garlic. Leave the wound for one or two days, then carry (meaning: move or transport).
Place a cotton ball soaked in oil over the area until it starts to drain. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, if God willing. If you wish, you can do this with some of the hot medicines that I mentioned in the eighteenth article about hot medicines.
And if it heals through iron, this is how it works: you would place the iron instrument that looks like this:.
The instrument is called the pin-like iron because its head resembles a pin, it has some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small nib.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand as you turn the iron a little at a time. The amount that burns through the skin should be like half of its thickness. Lift your hand so as not to burn the artery below which causes bleeding, then dip a cotton ball in salt water and place it on the area and leave it for three days. Then apply the cotton with lard, then treat it with ointment until it heals if Allah wills.
And if you want, you can sharpen this piece of the needle from the iron and guard against cutting the artery in this temporary localized condition.
Chapter Four.
This is the permanent wound.
If you have treated the wound with the advanced treatment we mentioned and in sections on diseases, and if the treatment did not work and you see symptoms that cannot be cured by what we first prescribed with medicine or fire. You should heat the iron until it turns white. Then, while you apply a line along the pain area as long as half an inch or so, hold your hand once and pull it tight until you cut the artery reaching near the bone.
However, you should beware of touching the movable jawbone during chewing as it can burn the muscle or the nerve that moves it, causing numbness.
And be cautious; when you cut the artery, there is danger of bleeding from it. And especially for those who do not know what to do and have no experienced guidance, leaving the work first is better.
And, may Allah willing, the treatment for sudden bleeding from the artery will be mentioned in its place in this book. If you see symptoms that cannot be resolved by this method, then...
I observed the dead body to be capable of being operated upon, specifically in the middle of the head as we described and treated the wound so that it may heal if God wills.
And if you wish, you can use the operation method that we mentioned in the section about bleeding the artery with a lancet of two blades; it is a better and more effective operation.
The fifth chapter.
In ear operations."]
If there is pain in the ear due to cold and it is treated with lubricants and all other treatments we have mentioned, but the pain persists, heat up the tool called the point which is depicted here.
Then, apply it after heating it around the entire ear or around both of them if the pain is in both. And move the operation tool slightly from the base of the ear after learning its position with the applicator, and let the operation tool contain about ten points in each ear or close to that number. Then treat the areas until it heals if God wills.
The sixth chapter.
In operations for strength."]
The operations for strength, which are treated with an instrument that produces phlegm as described in the sections on diseases.
And one should avoid the type of instrument that causes dryness and neuralgia.
When this type of strength is treated with needles, forceps, and suction devices and it does not relieve the pain, it may be necessary to operate on the patient with three instruments. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the jaw, and the third at the tip where the lips meet.
Make your incision against the diseased side because relaxation only occurs in the true healthy side.
A diagram of the incision should show an incision made against the upper part of the ear under the forehead slightly, and another in the mouth. Its length should be according to the length of the index finger.
Lower your hand until it burns half the thickness of the skin, and here is a diagram of the awl, which is a type of surgical instrument that has advanced in its design but is slightly softer than it as you can see. It should have a slight thickness in the blade. Then, treat the area as described until it heals if God willing.
The Seventh Chapter.
In the case of chronic numbness.
If the numbness persists and you have treated it as we instructed without improvement, and if there is no reason for failure such as fever, then apply four types of incisions. On each of his forehead, make an incision and another in the middle of the head as we mentioned, and on the tip of his head, as instructed.
The recipe for the awl as described, it can also be made with an incision on the mouth of the stomach to be more effective, then treat it as instructed.
The Eighth Chapter.
In the case of forgetfulness.
The one who has phlegm should first be given the largest nostrils and brain-clearing powders.
Then, shave his whole head and apply a turpentine bandage on the back of his neck as written in the article about adhesives; carry it multiple times, for it is a form of incision.
Perform it at the same rank mentioned there, then if he is freed with that, otherwise cut three knots from behind his head so that they are arranged from top of the head to bottom of the neck.
Place a finger's width between each knot and each knot, then treat the knot with what was mentioned. If you want more and it is possible given these circumstances, cut out the middle knot.
If you want more, cut between the two ends then treat until he is freed. The laceration should be like the one described.
The ninth section.
In traction, relax the entire body.
It is necessary to advance in cleaning the head with abrasives and what we have mentioned, then shave the head of the patient. After that, tie a knot at the middle of the head, one knot on each end of the head, and another knot behind its head.
And three on the neck prominences. If you need more for relaxing the body in some reason and the patient is capable of that with strong stubborn disease, tie four knots at his back prominences. Pull the knot until it burns more of the skin and lift your hand, then treat him as described until he is freed if God willing. The laceration should be like an oil lamp.
The tenth section.
In traction for epilepsy.
Only the epileptic who has seizures due to phlegm should first clean his brain with large abrasives and all other treatments that we have mentioned in this section, if possible for the patient to take medicine.
If, however, the child cannot bear the medicines, then he should use the brain cleansers and purifiers for a long time before that while improving his diet.
Then he shaves his head, then makes one incision in the middle of the head as described in the method, and another incision at the back. On each century of his head, make an incision, if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, make the incisions mentioned in the Falaj book, and rest your body on the cervical vertebrae and thoracic vertebrae, and apply a greasy treatment as described.
If the patient is a child, make the incision gentle in this manner.
The eleventh chapter.
In the incision of malaxolia.
If the cause of malaxolia is foul moisture and thick phlegm, then make the incisions as described in the Falaj book.
If the cause of malaxolia is a preference leaning towards black and the patient's body is excessively moist, then cleanse his brain as described in the section.
Then shave the head of the patient. Then make a tight cotton wad like a circle and place it in the middle of his head, with the patient sitting upright touching each side. Then take one pound of old sheep tallow.
Then heat it on the fire to a moderate hotness as much as can be tolerated by the finger if inserted in it. Then pour it over his head inside the circle, leaving him until it cools down. You do this every week with him, along with all his good procedures, until he recovers if Allah wills.
And if you wish to soften it, prick many small points in it without touching the needle with your hand. It will become smelly, for this kind of kii moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply cotton that has been soaked in oil or chicken fat on it.
The twelfth chapter.
In kii, the flowing water in the eye.
If you notice the beginning of the water flowing out of the eye according to the signs mentioned in this section, immediately wash it with clean water for a few days, protecting his head and body from all moisture, bathing him gently in the bath.
Then once with his hair shaved and oil rubbed in the center of his head, then rub two oils on the nostrils. If water begins to flow out of both eyes, do it for both. If only one eye starts leaking water, do it just for that eye.
Then, using the needle, cut all veins and arteries under the skin. Make sure these cuts are as long as twice the width of the nostrils, and be cautious to prevent blood loss.
If you see anything of it, cut it off in place with any treatment you can and we will come to the wisdom in releasing the arteries and cutting them, as well as preventing bleeding.
And it may harden under the cheekbones with two thick knots.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the case of chronic tears.
If the tears from the eye are chronic and constant, previously originating from the veins and arteries visible on the scalp, and you ascertain that this is due to cold thick mucus in copious quantities, apply the oil to the kii that was described specifically for water flowing out at the beginning. A cut in the middle of the head and two cuts on the jaws, and two cuts in the temples under the bones. If an increase is needed, a cut in each corner of the eye at the end of the eyebrow with a small nail.
The Fourteenth Chapter
In the section of the nose.
If it did not heal with the treatment we have mentioned in this section, hasten to him in the darkness of the blind bird for three nights then shave his head and use the olive oil nail to make the middle cut. Then, use the pin nail to make two cuts above the eyebrows under the hair slightly and be careful not to cut the artery. This is a picture of the pin nail.
The Fifteenth Chapter
In the section on relaxing the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to disease or moisture, make one eyelid cut with this semi-circular nail.
And if you wish, make two cuts slightly above the eyebrows on each side, away from the jaws, and let the length of each cut be along the eyebrow.
Don't exaggerate with the cut, but rather to the point where a third of the skin burns. The nail's shape should look like this.
The Sixteenth Chapter
In the eyelid section.
If her eyelashes turn inward and irritate the eye, there are two types of cut in this case. Either by cutting with fire or by cutting with the burned medicine, if you cut with fire then order the blind person beforehand to let his eyelashes grow out until they are long and even.
If it is grafted when planted, bind its eyes with a band to prevent movement until it grows. Once it has grown and matured, place the recipient's head in your stone then learn on the eyelid with a quill an inscription in the shape of a leaf.
The inscription begins near the inner corner of the eye. Then, place a cotton swab soaked in the white of the egg or saliva of the lizard under the lower eyelid. Next, heat up an iron to create this design's image.
Then, heat the iron slightly and repeatedly many times until the surface of the skin that resembles a leaf of an asp fully burns. It is evidence of proper work when you see the eyelid become discolored and hair has grown on the eye lid.
Then raise your hand and leave him for three days. After that, carry a cotton ball with beeswax to remove the scabs. Then treat it with ointment until he recovers if Allah wills. If any hair grows back after some time and the eyelid relaxes, then you have successfully treated him.
Repeat the procedure on that spot as you did initially. If hair is present on the lower eyelid, comb it until it returns to its natural position without causing any thinning of the eye hair. As for applying medicine by ironing, this involves instructing the recipient to refrain from rubbing his inner corner until it grows out evenly.
Then make a leaf-shaped picture from paper. Take soap that is usually used and unquenched tallow, each with the weight of one dirham or so. Crush them thoroughly together and do this using a pestle to ensure they don't dry out. Then proceed to flatten it onto the parchment that you have made like a card, and place it on one or both eyelids. Place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and let the camel's head rest on your stone.
Then place your index finger on top of the medicine and gently press it. As you move it, if the camel feels the taste of the medicine, he finds it as bitter as fire since he keeps finding it bitter. As long as he still finds it bitter, leave the medicine alone and move it with your finger until the bitterness disappears; then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And look, if you see that the eyelid has risen like it rises when burnt by fire or cut off, otherwise reapply medicine to the spot where the medicine did not affect and was not covered until your task is fulfilled and the eye has been burnt. Then place over it cotton with beeswax until the scab of the burn falls off.
Then treat it with the fly agaric balm or any other, until it heals. It is essential when performing your work that you be extremely cautious not to let any part of the medicine fall into the eye, for if the eyelid relaxes after a few days and we fear hair may fall into the eye.
Then reapply the medicine to that spot on which the eyelid has relaxed specifically as you did initially, then treat it until it heals. This is an image of a card-like object.
Know that people's eyes may differ in size, so according to this, let your burning be for them, there is no secret path to correctness for those who have a way in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
In the treatment of strabismus that is displayed in eye surgery.
If you treat the Saracen (a term historically used for non-Arab Muslims) with what we have mentioned in classifying diseases, if your treatment does not work, it is necessary to rely on this quality.
The weak one is commanded to place his head on your stone and hold his head captive between your hands, a holding that does not move or strike with his head.
Then, you place a cotton wick dipped in the white of the egg or in saliva from the frog on his eyes. Then, you heat the iron that this is an image of.
It should be hollowed out like a quill from one end which has the cut, and if you wish, it can be perforated at the other end. Alternatively, it could be flat like a metal rod, but this hollowed-out form is better for your work, God willing.
Then, you squeeze the Saracen if he is open and extract the cord from him or if he is not open, you open him up to take out a wad. Then, you put the iron on it; she is very stable so hold her firmly with your hand until you reach the bone.
And move your hand slightly away from the cut point towards the nose to avoid misguiding your hand or distressing the weak one, so that if the iron touches the eyelid, it will damage it. If you reach the bone in the first cut, otherwise, reheat the iron once again if necessary.
And leave him for three days, then apply cotton on him with fat and treat him with the dried ointment until he recovers. If it has been forty days and he does not recover, administer the strongest remedy to him until the bone comes out, as I will mention in its place if God willing.
Another way that some early ones mentioned regarding the place of the gynecorix, it made a cut to this place then put in the same cut a thin plug. This is its depiction.
And pour in it the weight of a one dirham's molten lead. Hold the plug firmly with your hand, making sure not to move even a little bit lest the molten lead seep into its eye. It should be advisable to place on the eye of the patient a cotton ball soaked in the white of egg or water.
If lead is used in the place of gynecorix, it burns that spot and heals it remarkably. It will heal the gynecorix if we use the method and treatment as mentioned earlier. Otherwise, using the nasal hole and returning the gynecorix to its original nasal passage route may be necessary according to specifics for that area.
The eighteenth chapter.
In the case of a split lip.
It often happens that a split occurs in the lip, which is called the 'hairline', especially in children's lips. It often occurs and when treated with what we mentioned earlier, if the treatment did not work, heat up a small surgical knife on this depiction.
Its interior is heated on the point of the knife, then place it carefully by the wheel in the same split until the heat reaches to the depth of the split. Then treat it with turtledove fat until God willing, it heals.
The nineteenth chapter.
In the case of acute gynecorix in the mouth.
If it appears at the base of the gum or in the alveolus or near the roots and a boil then inflamed, bursts, and becomes a flowing pus gynecorix, then treat it. If the treatment did not work as expected, it is necessary to heat up a tool suitable for the size of the gynecorix.
Then the nurse enters through the hole in the scaphoid bone and holds your hand until the nail is protected all the way to its base and extremity, doing this once or twice. Then, treat it with the remedies we mentioned until it heals if Allah wills.
If the material breaks and it heals, otherwise an incision is required on that spot. The diseased bone must be removed according to what will be described in its section if Allah wills.
The twenty-first chapter.
In it lies the organ of erections and the relaxed tonsils.
If the tonsils become relaxed due to moisture and movement of the organs occurs, treat it with medications but if it doesn't heal, place the head of the penis in your hand. Then heat up the iron that will follow this instruction after placing the tube on the organ.
The iron, held by the nurse and turned on a wheel, slightly holds your hand until you feel heat reaching the root of the organ, then lifts your hand. Then she repeats the iron several times as desired. The urine fills the mouth with salt water.
He holds it for an hour and then releases it. The moving organ becomes stable while the relaxed tonsil tightens, and dries out the excess moisture.
The twenty-first chapter.
In case of pain in the organ.
If the pain in the organ is due to cold or there's a worm inside that hasn't responded to medication, the method involves two options: either using oil, or applying fire.
As for applying oil, you should take the cow's fat, boil it in an iron pot or pan. Then take a cotton thread and twist it on one end of the stick. After dipping it into the hot oil, place it on the painful tooth with forceps and hold until it cools down.
Then repeat it until the force of the fire reaches the root of the tooth, or if you wish, you can immerse wool or cotton in the cold tallow and place it on the aching tooth and put the fireproof poker over it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
And as for treating it with fire, you do it by using a copper or iron pipe. There should be some wadding in its core so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then light the torch which will resemble its shape and place it on the same tooth, hold your hand until the torch cools down. Do this repeatedly.
If the pain disappears either on that day or another, then it is necessary afterwards to fill the patient's mouth with good tallow and hold it for an hour. Then throw it out; this is the shape of the torch.
Poke with any part you want and according to what is possible, this is the shape of the pipe.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In the iron whisk.[/explanation]
If the pigs [patients] are prone to phlegm and cold moisture, and do not yield to maturation with medicine, but you want quick maturation, then heat up the hollow iron whisk that has this shape with the tips inserted.
Smoke should come out from the other end when you heat it. Place it protected on the same tumor once, twice, if needed, until it reaches the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the iron whisk according to the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days, and carry on it a piece of wadding that has been soaked in tallow until what was burned by the fire disappears. Then treat him with ointment and needles until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Thirteenth
In the part above the hollow of the voice and the constriction of the breath.
If moisture predominates in the bronchial duct, especially when accompanied by a cold mood, it is advisable to first evacuate phlegm using laxative medications, then apply cold compression at the base of the hyoid bone where it is lowered.
Be careful not to reach the hyoid bone with your application, and do not burn any skin except half. Then apply a second compress at the joint of the neck where it meets the last major rib, making sure that the comb is set in accordance with the previous condition.
Then treat him/her according to what has been mentioned, until he/she recovers if God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Fourth
In the illness of the lung and coughing.
If the cough and lung illness are due to cold moisture and not related to phlegm or pneumonia, and if it is a chronic disease, apply two compresses above the costal arches in the soft, empty low areas, and another compress in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The comb should be set in accordance with the previously mentioned pattern. If you wish, it can also be a dot pack using the needle called a point, and its image was provided for extraction and pain in the ears. The points are made from thirty to around that number.
Then treat him/her according to what has been mentioned until he/she recovers. You can make a comb with three branches in this pattern and hasten the treatment because you apply it once as three treatments. This is the pattern of the comb.
The twenty-fifth chapter.
In the treatment of diseases.
If the shoulder blade head emerges due to slippery moist or until it is not firmly established when pushing back after its removal, making this a habitual action that repeats and then it gets removed at slightest movement like what we observed. It should be recommended that the jawbone should first return. Then the patient lies on his back or on the correct side. Then, you lift the skin that is inside the shoulder with your left hand's fingers from above if the joint has withdrawn inward.
Then you warm up the two-edged chisel, as it appears in this picture.
Then you scrape the skin until it penetrates to the other side, resulting in a four-edged shape. It might be scraped with a two-edged chisel forming a five-edged chisel when using one with three edges, and the edges would be on an angle corresponding to the direction of the hair.
This is a picture of the chisel with three edges.
And the number might be increased by one, making it eight knives. Then they are applied with salt on the extracted bones of the shoulder girdle. The patient should not move the limb until it heals; otherwise, if removal is upwards, this rarely happens.
Apply a single, well-sharpened shoulder knife or many finely-toothed knives above the thigh. This will strengthen the joint and eliminate moisture, thus healing the patient.
The twenty-sixth chapter.
In treating stomach ailments.
If there is a congestion and moisture in the stomach to such an extent that it disrupts its regularity and causes frequent diarrhea, treating it with various remedies without improvement should have led to lying on the patient's back extending their legs and arms, then scraping three knives. The incision should be made with the size of a finger by an awl, and two incisions below each side of one incision until the shape of the incisions becomes triangular. The distance between them mustn't allow for meeting when they heal. And the depth of the incision should be approximately one third of the thickness of the skin. And the shape of the incisions should be maintained.
On this image, and to this extent without excess.
And if you wish, make one large incision in the middle of the stomach on this image.
And the awl with which this single incision is made should be in the shape of a circle on this image.
And the stomach can be punctured with points for those who suffer from this cut, which is that you learn on the stomach a point according to what you want with the pen, then pierce it with a point awl, then treat it with your prescribed treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
In making the incision in the liver, it should be cold.
If the liver is exposed and there's pain due to coldness, dampness, or a foul wind, causing it to deviate from its natural mood excessively. Treating with the remedies we've discussed in this section did not prove effective. The ill person should lie on his back and learn with the pen three incisions in this shape and this amount, exactly like that, below the ribs where the human's pelvis ends, on the liver.
After each incision comes another one like the thickness of a finger. The incisions should be straight across the body's length, and you should not let your hand touch the awl yes indeed.
Let the amount of skin you burn be half as much as its thickness, no more. If it stands on its feet, let it do so; if not, lay it down with its legs extended and raised its arms. This is a representation of the forge.
And you can cauterize these sores with the scalpel forge if you have a gentle and careful hand in crafting, and beware not to burn too much as it will consume all the skin including the belly and reach the intestines. The skin there is thin, so be aware.
The Twenty-First Chapter.
In cutting and removing a tumor in the liver with cautery.
If there is an exhalation in the liver and you want to determine whether this tumor is within the liver tissue or its periphery, if it's within the liver, you will find that the patient feels a weight and pain without much intensity.
And if it's in the diaphragm of the liver, then there is intense pain and you see that doctors have given up trying to treat it. It would be best for him to lie on his side and then apply heat treatment with a heated implement.
Then heat the forge in the fire, this is the forge that resembles a mill and this is its image. Cauterize with it one incision until the skin is completely burned and finish burning up to the diaphragm, then remove the flesh by treating for abscesses until recovery occurs.
This type of incision should only be performed by someone who has extensive experience in medical practice, and these diseases have been tried on their hands multiple times. In that case, they can perform such a task, and it would be better to leave it with me.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In the art of cautery.
The first ones among the principles of the origin of cauterization for cold cautery is as follows: Take one dry, long rod from the source rods that is the longest you can find and make it like a thick finger. Then dip it in oil and bring it to the fire. Then, heat one point between the connection of the collarbone and the neck. Two small points are placed below it slightly inclined towards the chin area. Two large ones are placed above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs.
Two more points are placed between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly towards the back. Another point is located in the middle of the chest, another above the stomach. Three points are also placed behind one point, between the shoulders, two on both sides of the spine below the "S" point that exists between the shoulder blades.
It should not be that you plunge your hand deep into the point, but there should only be a sensation of burning on the surface of the skin. Some of the first ones have mentioned that among people, some use a nearly iron rod as an electrode which they protect and insert between the ribs until it reaches the tumor itself.
The duration is as we mentioned for a liver tumor. When the cautery hits this area, either the patient dies from the heat or they suffer from what remains incurable at that location.
The Thirty-first Chapter.
In the case of the gallbladder.
If you treated gallbladder disease with the treatment we mentioned in the previous section and it did not work, then there are three aspects of applying heat to it: each one is correct. One of them is to apply heat to three or four points arranged along the length of the gallbladder.
The form of liver stones that present their shape and are between each stone, a thickness equal to the width of a finger or more slightly. They have the property of the nut-shell characteristic which we mentioned in the stone of the liver; you do not need to go deep into the stone when palpating, and the image of the patient is lying on his back.
And the other face in the attached image and elevate the skin that is against the liver where the right and left lateral pouch of the patient ends, elevate the skin that is against the liver. And elevate your skin across the body width so that the stones lie along the body.
Then, the two safwadins are protected to such an extent that they penetrate through with the skin on the other side. Then, you remove the nut-shell; making four stones then. If you prefer, you can harden them using another nut-shell with three ridges.
Then, treat the site of the stone after allowing it to be saturated with pus for a long time; this is better than all other treatments that have been mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the stone of supplication.
The stone only benefits in the supplication of water, especially if it is irrigated by various treatments that we mentioned in this section. If your treatment was not effective, it is necessary to harden four stones around the spine and one on the stomach.
Another stone on the liver, one on the gallbladder, and two stones behind his back between the ribs one close to his chest and another close to his stomach. The depth of the stone should be approximately as thick as the skin. Then leave the stone open for the pus to discharge for a long time.
Do not leave the treatment of any sick person until it becomes necessary for gathering those responsible, so that healing can occur swiftly. The image of the brace used to support the back is cylindrical in line with previously described images and by which the back is supported, being oily.
The second and thirtieth chapter.
In the knees of both feet.
If they swell in the grooves and fill with yellow water, it is necessary to support the foot's back on the trigger point between the wrist bone and the base of the thumb.
And hold your hand with the brace, do not rub it. Then lift your hand and don't return it immediately; this allows the yellow water to be drained and the brace remains in this shape.
And place the braces on both thighs for each leg, with the brace being by the tip of the blade on one side and along the length of the thigh, one below the knee and another towards the center of the thigh. And on each buttock, two braces.
And leave the brace open without treatment for a long time, allowing it to drain water. Then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
The thirty-third chapter.
In the case of diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is caused by cold and moisture, leading to a weakened ability of the body's holding and digesting mechanisms in the stomach and small intestine. This condition requires various treatments but if it does not improve, when you find that the patient can tolerate it, give them a large brace for their stomach. As described earlier for the stomach brace, use a circular brace and four additional braces around the navel with the soft oily cylindrical brace. Place a large brace or two on the cotton above the tongue.
If I find excessive moisture and the cause is susceptible to this, then I should cut in a manner across the buttock and across each rib. Perhaps two smaller cuts near the larger one too; it's a successful treatment that doesn't err with its benefit if Allah wills.
The 43rd chapter.
In cases of troubles in childbirth.
If there are persistent, numerous or singular troubles in childbirth in the one giving birth, and if these issues involve mixtures that are thick, cold, or rotten fluids, and if they have been treated with what we mentioned in the previous section but the treatment was not effective, then cut three cuts on the lower part of the back near the waist line, slightly downwards like a triangle.
A cut under the pubis with two fingers' width. If you estimate that her stomach has cooled down, and her food doesn't digest properly, and if I see her face swollen, then cut on her stomach in a large manner as described earlier, and cut on her liver. Another one on the gallbladder with two needles, leave the cut open for a while, then heal him until he recovers if God wills.
The 53rd chapter.
In cases of vaginal discharges.
After cutting it, if you have cut the uterus, widen the tool that resembles a spoon, then insert it into the same cut of the uterus and hold your hand until the spoon reaches the wound where blood is dripping. Do this once or twice.
If the vaginal discharges are numerous, then cut each one with a cut as described. Then treat her with suitable ointments until she recovers; if you want to use more, cutting it heavily can be more beneficial for treatment.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the place of the sun that is in the seat and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the cut and the operation we described in its place, and refrains from that, he might recover by the sun. If this happens to a person affected by solar radiation, and if pus starts coming out of him along with foul-smelling fluids, then you should first use a delicate probe to assess the situation.
Then, determine the depth of the wound with a probe. Prepare a rod resembling a needle and insert it into the solar radiation affected area straightly at the angle of the solar radiation's depth and the extent that the probe has entered. Apply heat from the sun until all the infected tissues burn completely, which might require one, two or three times depending on your needs.
Be cautious not to burn any nerves if they exist, or cause excessive sweating. If the solar radiation leads towards the bladder organ or the bowel organ, be sure of this during your procedure.
Be cautious about all these areas. Do this if the solar radiation is within a meaty area and you have determined that it is not penetrating deeply, then treat the area until it heals completely. If the area closes up and cuts off its source, and remains like this for some time, know that it has healed perfectly.
And if it doesn't cut off its source, know that it is penetrating deeply or in a cavity of a rotten bone or similar things that will be discussed at the place where it occurs.
The thirty-fifth chapter.
In the healing of the kidney.
If it happens in the kidney and there is pain due to cold or strong wind, leading to a reduction in urination, it should be treated on the kidney with heat as done for each kidney using a searing stick similar to what you mentioned before. It might require three applications on the same table if you're doing it over several days. Having three rounds of this treatment arranged could lead to better benefits.
The Thirty-_fourth Section.
In the part of the bladder.
If there is weakness and relaxation in the bladder leading to it not retaining urine until the need arises, one should perform a procedure below the bladder where hair begins on the pubic area. One incision should be made at the right of the pubic area, and another at its north side.
It should be after each incision on either side up to the width of an opening for a thumb. It's done at the lower back or two if needed, and the incision is cylindrical as described above.
The Thirty-Fifth Section.
In the incision of the womb.
If there is a substance of cold and wetness in the womb that prevents it from carrying over the umbilical cord, spoils its texture, or causes it to fail in its functions, or if she experiences pain during menstruation, then three incisions should be made around the pubic area as we mentioned for the incision in the bladder. An incision on cotton below the back or two. The needle-like incision is made.
The Fortyth Section.
In the incision for removing the thigh bone.
If there are mistaken secretions reaching the right hip, they may cause it to move out of place. Its sign is that the leg will appear longer than the other if you measure one against the other and find a gap where the dislocation occurs; thus, it should be performed to remove the thigh bone itself in an incision resembling a half circle at its right side.
After learning around the right as it turns, so that the same right part falls in the center of the circle. The incision should be made with the incision that appears in an incision for removing the stomach contents if this incision is not enough, then perform three incisions with the large oily incision.
It directed for the length of cutting to be at the depth according to the thickness of all the skin, then treated it until it heals if Allah willing.
The forty-first chapter.
In the case of pus in the female's armpit.
If pain occurs in the buttock and this pain is caused by a reaction to dampness, treated with what we have mentioned in the section. If the treatment does not alleviate it, prolong this period; it may be necessary to facilitate the expulsion of the pus by using something oily or sap resin like that.
Then, place and position the incision in two ways, either with burnt medicines or with fire. The one done with fire has many forms; one of them is to make three triangular cuts on this shape directly on the buttock area itself.
Make its depth suitable, and the space between each cut should be according to the thickness of a finger. The cuts should be oily. Optionally, you can make one cut in the middle on top of the buttock itself, resulting in four cuts. If desired, you can perform it as a circle similar to what was mentioned earlier for removing the buttock's cut.
The circle should surround the entire buttock, burning all of the skin. This is how you perform the incision in pus in the armpit when pain is only localized to the buttocks and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, make two cuts on the thigh at the location indicated by the pus with pain. A cut above the armpit using four fingers towards the outer side is made slightly, and the incision should be scalpel-like in nature. The depth of the cut should be according to the thickness of the skin only.
And if he indicates that the pain extends to around the fingers, amputate there where he pointed at the dot three or four times or more as needed, and if he indicated the pain under the knee towards the leg, cut there in a single method with one incision.
And be careful in all cuts that you do not extend the cut to burn a major nerve or artery, for this leads to serious or temporary harm.
And I have seen two who cut above the waist and extended the incision, so the leg was swollen until it reached up to the ankle, got infected completely, and all parts of the body became unhealthy. Then diarrhea and death occurred afterwards. If the pain is in both sides equally, he should make this type of cut on them.
And some scholars among the wise have mentioned about the knee incision, that this is its condition; he makes a half cup made of iron with a diameter of half a span and it's at his mouth like a knot in the middle of an apricot pit or slightly less. Inside that cup there's another cup and a third cup.
And it should be after the space between each half cup is the width of an inch. The cups are open from both sides, and their height approaches one or two inches. A support made of iron that has been secured in the cups; this is its form.
And then it is cooked in fire until it turns red and then thrown out. It should be placed on the right side of the hip bone with the patient lying on his correct side, then he makes three horizontal cuts at once and leaves him for three days. He then moisturizes him with animal fat and leaves the wound open for several days.
And he heals it with ointment until it recovers, said the author of this book that this kind of cut was rarely used due to its discomfort and appearance and because few could endure it. But it is good for someone who can bear it and it fits well.
And if it is with burnt medicinal substances, then one should make two small canals resembling the grooves of a door hinge where the metal slides from brass or iron.
It will be in their midst an elevation of about two or so decades and there should be a thickness as thick as the width of a finger between them. It should have an open bottom and an open top, and it should touch each other like this.
Then place it on the true thigh and knee when you are lying on your correct side, gently place your hand. Then pour between the two circles a hot water which is slightly heated by fire, hold for about an hour's time, let the knee endure its warmth and burns, as he will find the sensation like fire.
Until the pain subsides, then lift your hand with the device and wipe away the hot water from the entire thigh with sweet water. Then leave it for three days and bear on it with fat until the blackness of burning disappears and leave it for as many days that phlegm flows out, as it is most effective in benefit.
Then treat him with ointments until he recovers. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for him according to what you made for the thigh, whichever is applicable. This is the formula for hot water and it has been proven in the article 'The Improvement of Medicines'.
You take half a part of the salt of copper and unburned lime from each one, crush them and put them in a new pot with a small hole at the bottom that can fit the drain. Underneath the pot you place another clean pot.
And pour over the copper and lime from sweet water that submerges them by the width of a finger after you thoroughly mix with your hand, leave the pot until the hot water descends at the bottom of the clean pot. Then collect all of this water and pour it on another piece of lime and copper that are also fresh.
When it is very intense, it behaves in many acts of medicine and on all organs because he does the same action as fire itself. There are also medications that strengthen the knee with them such as thafessia, honey from plumbago, and sulfur with soap.
Galen, an ancient doctor, claimed a story about an old man who treated a knee ache and the pain of childbirth. He greatly improved with this method and claimed that he needed no other treatment, saying it could cure once and for all.
Perhaps he might even carry the steam room on his back and come out cured. If there is no fresh verdigris, then the dry one can be used with a little of the fat and applied where there's pain on the knee or leg or thigh.
You should hold and release the steam for up to three hours or until the patient feels relief from the burning. Then, immerse them in the steam room when their body smells of sweat. If they feel better after taking a bath, then it means that the pain has gone away with the help of God. But if they are not cured, then repeat this process with another poultice after ten days.
He will be cured if God wills. Know that no one should use this medicine until their body has been used up. Dioscorides mentioned that rubbing the fat of a donkey on the knee could help with pain caused by childbirth.
The preparation of the donkey's fat is as follows: a thread of wool should be soaked in old oil and placed on the deep spot between the fingers of the hand and the bone (the wrist bone), which is closer to the bone than the finger. Then, take a dry piece of donkey's fat.
Heat it over fire until it becomes a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it till it extinguishes. Take another one; continue this process until the feeling reaches through the bone to the knee and relieves the pain with God's help. This method of donkey's fat is called 'the burning donkey'.
The Second and Forty-First Chapter.
In the treatment of back pain.
Back pain may occur due to many reasons, either from falling, hitting, overexertion and so on. It happens when cold, moist material accumulates in the body, and such is the case with back pain alone.
The one where cold material accumulates, after emptying the bladder with urine or something similar, should place three rows of seeds on his back across the width of the table. After learning the position with a writing brush in each row, place five toads or more depending on how much you expect from the patient's condition and strength.
The toad is done with point seeds, and if you prefer, it can be three or four toads using medium drilled seeds on this image.
The third and fiftieth chapter.
In the treatment of beginning the operation.
This condition often affects young children, and one of its signs in a child is the difficulty of breathing upon standing or movement. You may find that his last back parts have an eruption突出 on the surface among all the eruptions.
If you see this and want to stop it, prick with a needle that is circular as depicted in this image. Take the toad on each side of the lump evenly. Alternatively, if you prefer, prick around the lump with needle points in two or three rows; make sure that the points are close to each other. Then treat the area until it heals as described.
And remember, you should use the toad in the blister that occurs due to muscle spasms.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of gout and joint pain.
If joint pains due to cold moisture affect any part of the body, if they occur in both legs, it is customary for doctors to call this special gout.
If cold gout is treated with the methods of treatment we mentioned earlier in this section, and if the pains do not disappear, then it goes away with heat. This method involves heating around both legs with many kinds of heating pads, where the pad should be medium-sized and oily in appearance.
And if you need to puncture on the man's leg, perform with a point pad. If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this happens frequently, apply every pad around each knee four or five times using the same oily pad.
If you need more than this heat, apply it without penetrating your hand with the heat, but only up to about the thickness of the skin. If the pains ascend to the hips or back, use the method of heat that we mentioned in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, puncture around the wrists as if you were drawing two lines. If the pains remain in the fingers, puncture each node with a point and use a comb on the hand. If the pains ascend to the upper arms or underarms after a few days.
Apply them from every side, without neglecting good treatment and taking medicine. If one ensures proper diet and expels phlegm, he will be cured with this heat, if God willing.
The Forty-Fourth Section.
In the treatment of hypertrophy.
If a hernia appears in the abdominal area, and some pus and phlegm descend into the groin, especially if this is a recent onset, it would be advisable to advise the patient to refrain from eating for that day and instead use substances that help relieve the feces passing through his bowels.
Then he should lie down facing you on his back and you are to tell him to hold himself until the hernia or pus protrudes, then push it with your finger. You will then instruct him to perform the 'Ablution in Hernial Involvement' (Al-Wujoob fi Al-Ftah) by washing the area from beneath the hernia down to the hip bone. The mark you are looking for resembles half of a circle, its ends pointing towards the top of the body.
Then describe this image as it is.
Until a white one comes to repel the evil, then push back the pus or hernia inside him. Then, have a servant place his hand on the area so that it doesn't protrude. Once he has urinated between his legs and placed himself under cushions, another servant ties his legs.
And another at his chest holding his hands. Then place the mallet on the same mark and strike with the mallet while standing upright and straight, hold it until you reach the bone or do it again if it didn't reach to the bone in the first attempt.
Exert your effort to prevent the pus from protruding while hitting, so as not to burn it. This may cause death or great pain for the patient. Know that if you do not reach the bone with the mallet, your work has failed. And be aware that the boys' mallet should be suitable according to their capabilities and that of adults according to theirs.
Then, after three days, the surgical site for a cyst is treated with fat until the scorching from fire leaves. Then, it is treated with other ointments until healing occurs and the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the wound closes.
It is necessary to make his diet during the period of treatment as follows, to soften his stomach so that no leakage occurs during urination and defecation. Then, when he wants to stand up after forty days, a tight belt should be used which needs to be worn for another forty days. This helps in reducing fatigue, overeating from food and drinks, and severe coughing.
If this measure is used like this, it will achieve a complete healing if God willing. I will remember mentioning the treatment of hump disease in its section if God willing, and as for the hernia occurring anywhere else in the abdomen that was a beginning point, if you want to prevent it from increasing, make the hernia proportional to its size. Let the burnt skin be about one third, then treat it with what we have mentioned. It will not increase if God willing. Some predecessors advised to strengthen the hernia with a triangular thimble in this pattern.
After learning to treat the hernia with the needle, make a line across the top of the hernia and another one downwards. When you place your hand in the middle by one cylindrical ring, the first cyst is easier and better if God willing.
Chapter Sixty-Four.
In the case of the womb.
If there is a fall or blow in some organs causing pain that lasts for a long time, and if the treatment with medicines does not relieve it, then it should be treated with needle puncture. The needle should be of every organ according to its size, whether large or small, strength, and weakness.
He is able to cure the pain and swelling from them; if he has rid him of the first operation, otherwise he performs it again because it's customary for these pains to move from one organ to another near it. It would be wise to follow up with a second operation until the patient recovers.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
In scabies infection.
As for the lepers, they may benefit greatly from treatment, especially in the case of scabies which is due to the excretion of phlegm and black matter.
If you want to treat it, observe if the scabies is in its initial stages and treated with what we mentioned earlier. If it doesn't worsen or stop, fearing that decay might spread to all his organs, you should apply five operations on the head. The first one is in the middle of the head, as usual, and the second one below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair. Two are done on the temples, and one from behind on the lower jawbone. Keep your hand pressing the knife slightly until it affects the bone very gently.
And the scaly skin peels off, facilitating the evaporation of thick fumes from it and applying this kind of operation also to the liver as before. If the scabies has continued on the patient and shown clearly, it should be appropriate to apply these head operations that we mentioned earlier. An operation on the tip of the nose and two on each cheekbone. Two are done on neck folds, six on back folds, a large one on the buttocks behind the base of the tail when it's weak, another above it at the same level, and two on each thigh, one per leg. Two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the ankles and two on the elbows. Two over the breastbones and firmness on each joint of his hands' and legs' joints in a manner that is on each heel of his feet and ties his hands.
Be careful of the nerve at the heel, do not burn them. You can apply a firmness on the shin bone, another one on the mouth of the stomach and another on the liver. Know that the more firmly you do it, the better and more effective it will be.
Know that the sick person does not feel pain from the heat like the healthy one, because his body is numbed. The intensity of the heat should be adjusted according to the size and age as well as organs and joints based on previous knowledge about metal properties.
Then treat the heat with carob powder mixed with honey and other treatments until it heals, if Allah wills.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the case of nerve numbness, if a body part becomes numb after treatment with medicines, ointments and dressings but does not recover, then blow on that numb body part according to its bone size or smallness. Make your heat slightly thicker than the skin.
Then treat him with the ointment until it heals. It may alleviate some numbness affecting the hand and foot in spinal depressions when the nerve that moves this body part is affected, causing numbness to disappear.
Do not undertake this except for one who is familiar with the dissection of organs and the exits of the body's moving nerves.
Chapter Forty-Nine
In the case of scalds.
If the scalding doesn't heal and no medicine works, then apply a poultice on it with a slight depth up to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then, treat it with powdered lentils mixed with the fat of saffron, clove oil, and duck blood or the blood of fowl from each one a part. Combine all these components together, apply them on a piece of cloth, and cover the affected area until complete recovery occurs.
Chapter Fifty.
In the case of cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you wish to stop it, shave around it with a circular motion as if you were turning. Some scholars have mentioned that they use a particularly thick shaving method in the middle of the area, but I do not agree with this approach because I anticipate that it might cause irritation, having seen instances where this occurred.
The correct method is to shave around it in a circular motion as we have described, or with multiple poultices.
Chapter Sixty-Five.
In the case of jaundice.
If jaundice occurs in one and it has slowed down in maturation, either due to the effect of its cause or because of the age of the infirm who is elderly with little blood, or due to time, and if you want to speed up the maturing of the bile, then apply poultices around it made from small quantities scattered.
Then leave it, for it will speed up the maturing process. If you want to remove it by shaving, then adjust the size of the iron used as shown here.
Pour it in the middle of the ointment until it penetrates the skin, and let it be below what is there to facilitate the running out of pus. Then treat it with what is required so that it heals.
The second and fiftieth chapter.
In the treatment of vomiting.
The eater, it is nothing but corruption seeking to consume the organ as fire consumes dry wood. If I see the eater in a place that allows for burning with heat, then I apply a variety of needles of different sizes, according to what suits this location where the eater is found.
Then apply it from every direction until the whole corruption is eliminated and nothing remains. Leave him for three days, carrying on over the burned areas of sulfur mixed with oil until all the soot and all the corruption are removed completely.
Then treat it with medicinal applications for the flesh; if after three days I see that the flesh grows healthily without corruption, otherwise reapply heat to what remains of the corrupted areas. The eater can be treated with strong medicine.
Then it acts like fire more quickly, and I have mentioned its treatment with strong medicine in this section; take it whenever you need it.
The thirty-fifth chapter.
In the treatment of inverted and non-inverted needles.
Often this problem occurs in the soles of the feet, it is a rough thing that presses on the sole of the foot, and the treatment for it is either heat application or cold water application.
If it is done with fire, then heat the iron comb resembling a hawk's feather made of iron around each side where the nail is to be inserted and make its edges thin. Then lower this heated comb onto the nail and move your hand in circles around the nail until the comb reaches the depth of the nail.
And leave it for three days until pus begins to drain out, then apply a poultice of raw wheat pounded with salt onto the wound. Leave this poultice on overnight; it will detach from its roots and heal the wound with medicinal salve until it heals completely, provided that the nails are not reversed.
Infections often occur on the body surface, especially in hands and feet. It's advisable to take a copper pipe or one made of iron or hawk feather and insert it into the nail or splinter. Then pour some hot water, just enough for the pipe, inside.
Hold your hand while you're moving it gently back and forth. This enables the edge of the pipe to impact on the root of the nail, allowing the hot water to reach into the root of the nail. The victim should tolerate a moment's exposure to the hot water for a minute.
Then leave it and the nail will come out with its roots. Do this to each one until you have treated all parts in your body that have them, then apply medicinal ointments to those areas after they have been removed along with growing flesh.
The forty-fifth chapter.
In the treatment of piercing wounds.
If there is a piercing wound in one of the nerves or from a fever of a quarter or any other, it should be that four or five needles are heated and placed between each needle hole on the back rib and a needle on his chest. On his stomach, it is treated with oil extraction; thus, the abscess settles and accelerates the healing of the cold disease.
The fiftieth chapter.
In the case of acute urine retention in the body.
Certainly, it may spread in the body with disgusting blisters formed from cold viscous rotten matter. When they first appear, these are best contained on top of each benign, fatty blister using a reed or by heating one end of a long rod or using an ophthalmic lens.
And the pus may gather in its initial expansion on this condition, not increasing and dissipating its effective action, but rather removing it from suspicion. However, it must be done after expelling the suspicion with discharging.
The sixtieth chapter.
In the case of acute bleeding during the amputation of the artery.
Very often, there is bleeding of blood from an artery that has been severed during a wound exposed from the outside or when splitting a tumor or organ like such cases where it's hard to cut.
If this happens to one, quickly extend your hand to the mouth of the artery and place your index finger on it, pulling gently until the blood is contained under your finger and nothing escapes. Then put several small and large oil-based wicks in fire for some time, breathing over them until they become very hot.
Then take one, either small or large depending on the wound and where the artery has ruptured. Apply the wick to the same vein after quickly removing your finger with a wheel, holding the wick until the bleeding stops.
If the finger slips out of the artery's mouth upon lifting and the cork is extinguished, take another iron from the prepared fire, using the wheel. Continue this process with one after another until the blood is cut off.
And observe, do not burn the nerve if there is one present, and discuss another method with the patient. And know that if blood flows out of the artery, it cannot be cut again, especially if the artery is large, except through four means: either by burning as we have mentioned or by removing it if it hasn't been removed yet. If it is removed, its ends contract and the blood stops flowing. Alternatively, it can be tied with a tight knot or it can have medicines that tend to stop the blood flow placed on it, with a firm and secure grip.
And as for those who attempt to cut it with a band or by pulling on the torn parts, or by placing burnt things and such, it does not stop in that way at all except rarely. If one is exposed to any of this without having a doctor or medicine ready, they should place the affected finger over the wound itself, as we described.
He pulls it tightly until the blood is squeezed out and flows above the wound, on the artery, and the finger does not come off with extreme cold water for as long as the blood congeals and hardens, at which point it is cut. During this period, you look into what you need such as a fire or medicine.
The Second Door.
In the cut, the puncture, the fissure, and surgeries and so on.
Behind this, we have mentioned in the first door all diseases that are treatable with fire and burned medicine, and their reasons, causes, tools, forms of the cogs, and made those chapters from century to antiquity.
And in this chapter I follow that particular approach when it comes to this subject, making it easier for the student to fulfill what is required of them.
And before I begin this, you should know my sons that in this chapter there are more traps than in the previous first one.
And for this reason, the caution should be stronger in it because the work in this chapter often leads to bleeding from the vital blood when a sweat pore is opened or a cut is made on a tumor or a discharge pocket or surgical treatment or removal of an arrow or cutting on a stone and so forth; all which are accompanied by traps and fear, and death occurs in most of them.
And I advise you to avoid things that are uncertain for you, because in this trade there are various kinds of people with different diseases; some have suffered from their illness and were harmed by death.
For the severity of their suffering and length of their illness, as well as from being resolved by their disease to death, some have spent their wealth on your recovery hoping for health, but you should not assist those who are like this in nature.
And let your caution be stronger than your desire and concern. Do not engage in anything of that nature except after certain knowledge that has convinced you about the desired outcome, and use in all treatments for your illness advancement in knowledge and warning about what leads to safety.
And in that, you have support for acquiring praise and glory, mention and commendation. May God inspire you to guide your path and do not forbid yourselves from the right path and success; indeed, it is within His power, there's no god but He.
And this chapter has been organized into sections based on what was discussed in the previous chapters regarding the first century and beyond, so that it eases your request if God wills.
Chapter One.
In the treatment of water that gathers at the heads of boys.
This condition often affects boys during birth if the midwife presses the head of the baby roughly. It may also occur for unknown reasons that are not known.
I have not seen this cause in any other boys, and all of those I saw among them died quickly. Therefore, I decided to abandon working on them. And I have seen a boy whose head was filled with water, and the head grows larger every day. Until he couldn't bear to sit on himself due to the size of his head and the moisture increased until he died.
This moisture either gathers between the skin and bone or under the bone on the scalp. In this situation, if the moisture is within the skin and bone and the tumor is small, it may be necessary to make a single longitudinal cut in the middle of the head until the moisture flows out. This is an example of the surgeon's technique.
If the moisture is more abundant and the tumor larger, make two intersecting cuts like this:.
And if the moisture is under the bone, its sign is to see scalp wrinkles opening from every side and water decreases when you squeeze it with your hand inside; this should not be hidden from you. It may be necessary to make three cuts in the middle of the head like this:
After the incision, all moisture comes out. Then stitch up the cuts with sutures and ointments. Wash it from above with water and oil until day five. Remove the bandages and treat the wound with plasters and ointments. Do not overly pull on the head and feed the patient with any dry food that has little moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals, another remedy is to look where the bone of the tumor appears and where water collects because it may be at the back of the head or in its front part or on the right or north.
You are referring to making an incision where the tumor has appeared and water accumulation, so you make the incision as much as possible and remember to cut a vessel causing profuse bleeding. This severe bleeding will lead to death due to that hemorrhage along with the removal of moisture.
The second chapter.
Cutting the two veins behind the ears known as Hassians.
When someone experienced severe problems affecting the eyes or chest and conventional medical treatments failed to alleviate this, it was recommended to perform the surgery of cutting these two veins.
If you wish to cut them, you should shave the head of the patient according to Mosaic style. Then scratch the area with a coarse needle so that the vein is visible. Next, tie the neck of the patient by using his cloak, then look where the pulse beats and their positions - those two hidden places behind the ears. There may be some who hide these apart from others.
Then stitch them with thread, cut them with a nail drill straight down to the bone, and this should be across the head. If you wish, you can enter the drill under the vein and cut it upwards by slicing; the length of the cut would be about two inches.
If the sweat is cut off, blood will come out in a pulsating flow that pushes forwards and upwards towards the chest and body. If you can't see the vein for touch alone, it would be appropriate to estimate three fingers from the ear after stitching it, then stitch with thread until reaching the bone, which should happen if these conditions are met.
The excerpt instructs that six points should be sent through the medium from the blood, and possibly more or less depending on your perception of the strength of the patient's condition and saturation of their arteries. Then, you should examine the wound; if there is still a part of obstruction remaining within the bone, cut it.
To prevent a hot tumor from appearing, stitch the wound with a thread from cotton gauze, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
The third chapter.
Suturing the two veins in the axilla.
If a person experiences recurrent or severe episodes of sweating, cold chills affecting the muscles in the axilla, constant headaches, and similar symptoms that do not respond to various treatments prescribed by medicine, we have found success in treating these illnesses by suturing the veins in the axilla or its region, as described.
The purpose of suturing involves shaving the hair on the axilla, specifically referring to the prominent vein in the armpit. From its pulsation, you can discern that most of what is hidden from people's bodies is within the individual person.
Or when there is severe cold, if the affected person cannot be seen clearly, you should have the patient tighten their neck with a thick garment. Then you mark the location with an incision or heat the area with hot water until the vein becomes visible, clearly and distinctly. Then take the scalpel which has this shape. Then, using it, you gently peel off the skin until you reach the vein. Then place a thread on it and pull it upwards to remove it from under the skin. If it comes with clots from every side, remove them. If the vein is delicate, use the tip of the thread to tie it. Then, cut a part of it according to how far apart his ends are and make it tighten without causing bleeding. If it does not heal and does not get severed, blood never circulates at all. Then, drain the blood from six places to three.
If the artery is large, it may be necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread. Let the thread either come from hemp or from the strings of the rosewood for fear that the fungus does not hurry before the wound愈hes and causes bleeding.
Then, cut a preference between the ligatures. Do this at that moment or after another time, and if you wish, fill it with lead using a sharp knife until its ends get removed. This operation is equivalent to it or better than what we said.
However, if there is fever or mood swings in the patient because lead helps to eliminate moisture, it might be more effective, and after ligation of the arteries, the site should be filled with old cotton and bandages should be applied. After healing, he should be treated with dried medicines that promote wound healing and salt until he recovers if Allah wills.
If bleeding occurs during your operation, you should immediately address it either by using lead or by filling the site with wax and tightening your hand until the blood stops. If this does not stop the bleeding, place your finger to cool the blood.
Let the area be immersed in extremely cold water until the pain subsides and tighten it as necessary. It is easier and less demanding than ligation of the artery when you apply lead to this knife with two blades after learning their positions with a pen.
The nurse lowers it very much until it reaches the bone, causing perspiration in two places so that the distance between its ends increases. It doesn't heal like this, and here is a picture of the tongs.
The blades of the needles should resemble the smaller horns, but they should be much less sharp than the needle itself. If they were as sharp as a needle, ice would form faster and the flesh wouldn't cut off quickly. If there is some roughness in them, fire holds onto their heat.
The flesh was cut quickly, and this operation is better than all other operations, lighter, and easier. Let there be a thickness of the finger's roughness between the needles.
Chapter Four.
In treating the constant overflow of hot tears to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their overflow is from the sweat glands on the forehead from outside, and no benefit was derived from treating with medical drugs, I saw that the face of the afflicted had turned red. He feels a sting on his forehead like that of an insect's stinger, and his eyes are wet and drooping, with their eyelashes having formed clumps and their eyebrows being disheveled from the severity of the tears. They had to resort to this procedure as an initial treatment for it, which they call 'treating with a sword'. This involves ordering the afflicted person to shave the hair on their forehead.
Then, three incisions are made in the forehead. These incisions are parallel to each other along the length of the forehead. The first one is about the width of two fingers and runs parallel to the nose's middle line on the forehead's center. The second one is slightly offset from the movement of the muscle in the jaw area. And the third one is made on the opposite side.
Preserve the two veins on each side, and move your hand away from the connection of the jaws. Make sure there's a distance after every incision as wide as three folded fingers are. Have with you a sponge cut for absorbing or many wet swabs to soak up blood.
Then the sharp ends of the clamp, as shown in this picture, enters. From the incision following the bite to the middle incision, all the skin between the two cuts, along with the perichondrium on the bone, is excised. Then this process is also done from the middle cut to the third incision, and then this clamp is removed. Also enters the first incision another instrument called a sharp scissor on one side and smooth non-sharp on the other, this is its picture:.
Make its sharp side towards the meat stuck to the skin and its smooth side towards the bone, push it until it reaches the middle incision, then cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do this from the middle incision to the other, after a moderate amount of blood has drained, squeeze the places with clots of blood then in each incision put cotton wicks and place on them poultices made of water and oil or honey and oil.
So that no hot tumor occurs, by the third day the bandage resolves and the poultice is used abundantly with warm water. Then it is treated with the basilean ointment with rose oil and all other treatments for wounds until it heals if God wills.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from behind the head.
A severe, continuous fever occurred to someone causing frequent heavy discharges. You see their eyes turned small and weakened with their eyelashes falling out from them. And there will be severe, painful head pain and a continuous cough. Know from these symptoms that the substances and discharges come from many deep blood vessels. The best treatment in such cases is this: command the patient to shave his forehead, then make him open a single cut in the middle of the forehead.
And there will be severe, painful head pain and a continuous cough. Know from these symptoms that the substances and discharges come from many deep blood vessels. The best treatment in such cases is this: command the patient to shave his forehead, then make him open a single cut in the middle of the forehead. Or lift it slightly upwards and start making the cut from the left nipple to the right nipple, with the cut going towards the bone. Your hand should be kept away from the moving muscles of the nipples when you chew until the bone is exposed and all blood is soaked by sponge.
Then separate the edges of the cut with old cotton or a thread from the cotton, then pull from above using the ligatures and soak the ligatures in water and oil to prevent the formation of a hot tumor. Once you have removed it, if you see that the hot tumor has penetrated into it, you should scrape the bone so that new flesh begins to grow.
Then treat it with the drying method that promotes flesh growth, like taking two parts from sesame flour and four parts from clove oil. Prepare this ointment and use it to promote flesh growth in injuries of a similar nature.
The Sixth Chapter.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is of four types, either a metal rock or something akin to a rock like iron and glass, or a plant seed such as fava beans and kernels and so forth, or something liquid like water and vinegar and so on.
If it is an animal, when a stone or a kind of stone that does not overflow in the ear falls into the ear, receive the ear towards the sun. If you see something being fixed inside a drop of butterfat or a snail's slime on the stone then try to remove it by movement of the head or scraping with a scalpel. Stop the coughing when it comes after coughing, by placing a loop of thread or wool around the ear and lifting the ear upwards. This treatment often removes the obstruction in this way; if it doesn't come out then try removing it with a soft hair pick as shown.
If it comes out with the hairpick and otherwise, try to remove it with a thin dimpled metal rod. If that does not work either, make an assy from brass and insert one end of the tube deeply into the ear hole smoothly.
Caulk around the tube with tallow-soaked wadding so that there is no way for the wind other than the tube. Then pull it strongly and often by your breath, often enough, it usually comes out like this. If it does not come out as described and otherwise, take a small piece of bird lark or finely prepared bird seed that you use to feed birds, put it at the end of the rod.
After tightly wrapping it around cotton, then gently insert it into the ear hole after drying the ear from moisture. If it does not come out with all that we have described, be quick to make a cut before the hot tumor or convulsion occurs.
The method of the cut is to strip the wax first, letting it bleed according to its strength. Then, place the wax between your hands and turn his ear upwards; make a small cut at the base of the ear where its fatness is in the lower position.
The cut will be in a semicircular shape until it reaches the stone, then remove it with whatever you can through machines. Then sew the cut as fast as possible and treat it until it heals.
And if the thing that falls in the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, try to remove it as we've mentioned. If it doesn't come out through this method, take a fine, gentle plunger according to this description.
Try to cut that kind of grain that falls in the ear. However, you only do this if you are sure that that grain has been soaked by the ear's steam until it becomes a multitude of small pieces, then remove it with a blind syringe or a gentle plunger or with an iron.
As we mentioned, it makes its removal easier. As for the water entering the ear, it should be expected that the phlegm produced by coughing with the camel's hoof will do so first. If there is something of cotton that fills his ear while he is lying on that ear containing water, and if it does come out like this.
Otherwise, take many pebbles along the fingers that are smooth and round. Heat them slightly with fire and insert one of these phlegm balls into her ear hole and blow it on each foot from that side. Then hit another stone on the stone in the ear.
He continues doing this with stone by stone until all the water is removed. Water may be extracted by taking one from the goose down or from a feather, inserting its end in the ear and heating the other end until most of it burns. Then another feather is used again.
You perform this several times until all the water is removed or draw it out with the tube as explained in the stone. As for removing the animal inside, observe: if it has a small body like the seed and similar objects, you act upon it according to what was mentioned in that section and so on.
If the size of the body is noticeable to touch, try to remove it using forceps and speculums, making the process easier than all that may occur in the ear. And when removing the wax that has grown in the ear, if you treated it as we mentioned under the section on excess wax in the article on earwax, and if your treatment did not succeed.
You should look at the ear in sunlight. If you see a bit of wax, remove it with forceps or gentle speculums. If you don't see anything from them, take this as its image.
Narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, insert the delicate tip of the instrument into the ear to the extent that it can bear, then firmly scrape with it. Do this several times until all the wax is removed. If no action occurs for removal, seal around the tube with candle wax as you were instructed for the stone.
If, however, it does not come out as we have instructed, use the forceps that were mentioned and try them first in killing wax which you will find described in the article on forceps. You can also smear with oils and medicines into the ear using this instrument. This is its image:".
Make it as you see, either from silver or brass. It is narrow at the bottom and has a small hole in it, wide at the top. If desired, you can insert a piece of brass tightly inside the tube's cavity and if desired, take it twisted with a string that's wound tightly on its end.
Then pour the oil or juice or whatever medicine you desire into the tube and it's in the ear. Then insert the string with cotton at the top and gently squeeze with your hand until the oil flows into the auditory canal, causing a sensation.
For the ear, enter within. Let whatever you put in the ear have been slightly warmed by fire and be careful not to allow it to be either too cold or too hot. The ear cannot bear this.
The seventh chapter.
In treating the obstruction in the ear.
Some children may be born without being attached, and without their eardrums in their mothers' wombs and ears.
And it can also expose some people to having an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or living tissue there. This obstruction may be at the depth of the eardrum, not visible to the eye.
It may extend slightly outside the hole and be visible. The one that is in the depth of the ear and not visible is usually hard to see. The one that can be seen, it should be placed by the ear of Albucasis towards the sun. And look inside, if you see the obstruction clearly, open it with a gentle forceps, and this is its appearance:.
It will have a slight extension that is somewhat limited, and the rest of the forceps is smooth to avoid harming the ear. If the obstruction is due to living tissue having grown in the ear canal, hold it with a gentle spatula and cut it off gently until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is in the depth of the ear, take a gentle and smooth one to pull it out slightly. Warm it slightly with fire then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction with what Albucasis feels from hearing weight, remove it gently.
Be careful not to damage the ear nerve, then insert a wick into the ear that matches the size of the hole, having been dipped in Egyptian ointment. Do this for days until you can ensure there is no adhesion at the wound or else take out the wick before water and rub it with powdered soap.
Use it if you see the ear has swelled and put in a hot thing, it should be expected that the wick will come out and replace it with another wick that is tarred in a pipe made with rose oil until it soothes the hot lump, then treat it until it heals.
If there is a blood flow, immerse a sponge or a cloth in cold water and place it on the ear. Then use all the treatment that stops the mentioned bleeding as described in the article about 'Coots'.
The Eighth Chapter.
In the treatment of boils that appear on the cheeks.
These boils that appear on the eyelids can be wet or dry, it should be pinched with tweezers or forceps and cut from their roots. Then apply a poultice made of powder in the place.
If there is bleeding from it, heal it with a gentle glass pipette, it's better to do this after cutting and it often comes back if there is something left of its roots, and if you burn it with fire, those roots are burned and it no longer recurs.
The Ninth Chapter.
In the treatment of colds that occur on the cheeks.
Very often, something resembling a cold in terms of its intensity and hardness appears on the cheeks.
Therefore, it is called cold, which is a collection of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The operation for this involves looking if the cold lump stands out on the surface of the eyelid, move it to every direction; if it's easy to move, then make a cut across it.
Then cut it gently from every side until it disappears, then hang it with forceps and cut it. If you cannot cut it right away after the operation on the eyelid, this does not harm anything; if the cut is large, suture it together, treat it until it heals.
If it's small, there is no harm in leaving it because the ointment will push and bind it. If the cold compress leans towards the inner eyelid towards the inner surface, turn the eyelid and hang the compress with a suture without needing to cut and penetrate it from every side.
If the eyelid is cut through, it will not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting off the compress with salt water and treat the area with something that binds until the discharge clears.
The Tenth Chapter.
In the treatment of the trachoma that affects the eyelid.
Trachoma is a pimple that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid. It occurs more frequently in boys and affects their vision, causing them to struggle with sunlight and unable to look directly at the sun's light. In order that the tears hasten towards them.
Therefore, you see them leaning on their faces constantly and sleep on them. Their eyelids are wet due to puffiness and swelling from the trachoma which is clearly visible. Whenever you press the area with your fingers, you can feel the lump of the trachoma between them. The purpose of the operation is for the patient to place his head in a hole you dig.
Then take a piece of cotton and prepare it into a wick. Make a circle out of this wick that is as large as the trachoma from all sides. Place it on the affected area, press down with your fingers from every side to gather the trachoma in the middle of the circle.
Then, with the snail saw, make a cut in the center of this moisture across only; the width of the cut should not be larger than the cut that exists on the cornea. As for depth, you must cut the skin completely until you reach the trachoma.
In most cases, the suture emerges from the cut in the form of a white piece of fat which you can draw out with a stitch that you have wrapped between your fingers to outside. Do this while moving your hand left and right until it is free; be cautious not to deepen the cut for fear of damaging the eye by the instrument.
If the suture does not appear in the first cut, it may be necessary to slightly deepen the cut gently until the suture becomes visible, then draw it out as we have said. Then immerse a stitch in vinegar and water and place it on the site, tightening it with stitches, and some people press salt onto it.
He places it in the cavity of the cut so that it dissolves any remaining moisture. Then treat it until it heals. If there is a hot spot on the site, cool it with soothing poultices until it heals.
The eleventh chapter.
In types of corneal abrasion.
If a growth (lump) appears on the eyelid, it is an excess over its natural path beneath the normal eyelashes. If left untreated, it can harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant watering of the eyes, drooping eyelids, whitening, and hardness until this becomes a reason for the loss of vision.
Corneal abrasion can occur on four aspects, either by rubbing with fire or as mentioned in the section on rubbing with medication, or it may be due to scratching and stitching or cutting, which is what I have described.
You should place the eyelid in your palm and then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns, otherwise insert an eyelash there from under the lower lid and pass the needle with the thread above, making sure to pull the thread towards the top of the lid.
Turn it with the forceps, then cut in the inner eyelid without cutting excess hair from the nippers from the larger to the smaller fold. Then thread the thread and place a small pad of cotton or flax under the eyelid, then stitch on the eyelid with needle.
Like a sheet of an ace, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to lift the eyelid because this varies among people. Some may require cutting from the eyelid a suitable amount according to how relaxed the eyelid is.
Some require cutting less of all this according to how relaxed the eyelid is, then cut with forceps along the lines you were taught and start from the larger fold to the smaller one. The incision should be near natural hair by about the thickness of the forcep.
Then, enter the needle into one of the corners of the skin, then peel it all off. Then join both lips with a needle and fine silk thread, clean up any remaining blood, and attach what is left of the threads on the eyebrows to some hanging objects if needed.
Choose to do it this way or not, the stitches and threads remain for about three days or four. Then treat him/her, or if you choose to leave the wound without stitches, treat it with whatever dries and constricts; the eyelid rises when the injury is sealed and reunited with stitches, and stitches are better.
This method of lifting the eyebrow, I mentioned it first except that there is a burden on the surgeon which is good and without danger. There's another aspect in this, which is to stitch the eyelid in the shape of an ace card as we described. Then lift the eyebrow with three needles which could be separate or grouped in this pattern:".
Then cut off the preferred part of the eyelid with a small scissor like this image, cutting it in moderation.
If you are unable to hold the needles and cannot wait, take an needle with a thread in it, insert the thread into the middle of the figure and insert another thread close to the major hole and a third thread close to the minor hole. Gather the threads between your fingers moderately, then lift your hand slightly, moderately.
Then lift all the taught skin as described, then sew together the cut edge with stitches and treat it until it heals. If a sore is hot after your cutting or incision, cool that sore with rose water and other soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also cause its lashes to turn and it is necessary to use the cutting, sewing, and applying ointments we mentioned, as well as applying fire or hot medicine treatments. With fire or hot medicine, they provide better but more subtle treatment than cutting and sewing, with more precise cuts and stitches in both.
The application of the stick treatment involves turning the eyelid and making an incision from inside as described, then creating two or three fine sticks with their lengths along the length of the eyelid and widths less than that of the suture line.
And I have borrowed from their ends of both sides where the threads stick, then gently gather them on the preferred part of the eye lid and pull each stick tightly from both sides. Leave it for a few days; the tightened skin dies, darkens and rots.
Until it falls off on its own; if you slow down the process, treat her with delayed treatment until she heals. If the eye lid swells and does not diminish the lashes of the eye, this is how to make the two sticks according to this shape and size in both length and width:.
The twelfth chapter.
In lifting the fallen eyelash using a needle.
If a hair or two is causing this, then take a fine needle and insert therein a thread of fine silk that has been smoothed. Then gather its ends and loosely tie them in a knot; let the length of the string be about a foot long.
Then insert another fine string shorter than the first one, and if you wish tie its ends. Then place the patient's head on your cushion and have it close to the sun so that you can see clearly; this is meticulous work. Then insert the needle into the base of the excess hair through the animal skin.
And execute it on the eyelid with the wheel until it comes out above the natural hair, then pull the string upwards over the animal skin and insert that hair through those animal skins if it is one or two or three hairs no more.
Then pull your hand with it so that the hair comes out of the eyelid together with the animal skin along with the natural hair. If you pulled off the animal skins but not the hair, pull the animal skins downwards using the string that was threaded through them until they come out from the top hole.
Then place the hair back in and pull them, do this until you see it in the top hole, then release the animal skins and the string and remove them. Pull on the eye and leave it taut for two or three days until the hair stays put and new flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add to it a long natural hair that will rise with it or leave it until it grows longer and then lift it.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the treatment of blepharitis that occurs in the upper eyelid.
The blepharitis that affects this condition is called trachoma. It can be either natural or secondary. Secondary blepharitis arises from a wound, cut or scratch and so forth.
The purpose of the treatment is to cut through this confluence, spreading its edges and create a thread of cotton in between. It should be tied until it heals. There should not be any substance used in its treatment that dries up and contracts.
If you do this, the blepharitis will worsen much more than it was. Instead of using items that dry out like a ring, a needle in water where I have washed my hands and cotton, or a Diakhel paste mixed with some oils and applied it on a stick, which then is rubbed into the affected area for treatment.
And the cure for it is to use every trick not to heal in the same shape as before. This action we mentioned, it's a sort of repair on the blepharitis rather than to revert the place's condition according to its original state.
The fourteenth chapter.
In the treatment of blepharitis that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This kind of blepharitis, which is at the bottom and is truly called trachoma, can be either natural or secondary. The secondary one arises from a wound, cut, scratch and so forth.
The method of treating it involves taking a needle with two threads and piercing the flesh. You then thread it from the left margin to the right, making sure the string is in between the flesh. Next, you lift up the flesh using the needle and cut it with a broad pair of scissors.
If the shape of the lid returns to what it should be, otherwise you take a thread and place it on the site of the cut and move the eyelid, you make two cuts in the inner side of the lid and have the ends of the cuts from the corners of the section where you cut until they meet; then they form an angle. Even if they meet, their shape becomes similar to this shape:.
And it is the Greek letter lam, then remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp side is below what follows the lid. Then gather together the separated parts with two stitches sewn with wool thread, and treat it with the medications we mentioned for relaxing and healing until it heals.
And if the suture has been exposed from a cut or stitch, or if it should be simple as stated above without hair follicles also, then divide between the lips with a thread as mentioned.
And the statement about treating the suture if it was from above or below is that you should do the work according to what becomes available to you in the shape of the suture, for it may have a large variety in appearance, and the surgeon devises the trick by whatever means he can.
So that the appearance returns to its natural form or comes close to it, and the same disease guides you on what is suitable for his work and tool in most cases.
The fifteenth chapter.
In attaching the eyelid to the eyebrow or cornea.
This attachment may be problematic for many as it can make the upper eyelid adhere to the white part of the eye, limiting its ease of movement and hindering its natural functions. It is advisable to insert one end of a thread under the eyelid.
Raise it upwards or support it with a brace, then cut the attachment with a very soft clamp that is not too sharp on cutting the clamps. This ensures no discomfort for the patient when working and allows the clamp to not harm the eye due to its sharpness. You should make your cut as if you are peeling off this attachment.
And anticipate until the eyelid returns to its natural state and all of the attachment is healed. Then, when that occurs, pour in the eye salty water for washing or use the moisture from the camel's nostril solution mixed with water, then separate between the eyelid and the eye using a thread of cotton.
And place wool swabbed with egg white above the eye, and use pungent remedies until it heals after the third day.
The sixteenth chapter.
In cutting the hoof and removing the bone spur.
The hoof can be of two types, either it is nervous resembling a hard, thin flap and/or not nervous which resembles a dry white moisture if it comes into contact with iron or when taken by the brace it breaks.
If the brace did not set in her, and both of these types begin from the larger eye socket until it gradually covers the pupil preventing light and eye movement. The operation involves having the patient place their head on a stone during this.
Then he opens his eyes, and you raise the eyelid with your hand. Then, you catch the hoof with a slightly bent brace and lift it upwards. Afterwards, take a needle and insert a hair from a horse or cow's mane along with strong thread. You bend the needle tip slightly and pierce it in the middle of the hoof.
The operation is performed with a needle, the eyebrow is connected with thread, and it is extended upwards. Then, hair is cut on the side of the eyebrow following the eyelid line as if spreading the hair by the hair to its end. Afterward, any remaining part of the moustache is cut off at the root using a gentle pair of scissors or a small clipper, leaving natural moustache.
In order to prevent leakage of continuous tears, the eyebrow is sewn with a single needle or thread as we mentioned, then cut at the smooth pairer which is illustrated in this view:.
It is important to avoid the pairer touching the corneal epithelium as this could cause a tear in it leading to inflammation of the eye. After cutting, you place something like powdered salt or snail slime in the eye and leave it until the next day then treat it accordingly until it heals.
If the eyebrow is not sensitive and cannot be penetrated by a needle or held in place with a single stitch, it often treats this type of eyebrow using medication as described within the section. If you wish to cut it, open the pupil's eye.
Take a gentle smooth pairer as illustrated in this image:. Carefully remove the eyebrow above by gently scraping it. If you notice that it's breaking and spreading, scrape only through the snail slime on your eye or the red part or powdered salt. Then pull on the eyelid until the next day.
Then, continue the process until all is gone, except if it obstructs in your eye and there's a hot lump, leave it alone and treat the hot lump until it heals. Then resume scraping on her until she heals. As for the moustache肉, let natural moustache grow.
If the cause of damage to the eye is a blow, then connect that cause with a string and cut off some of it, do not be thorough in cutting for fear of weeping then shave off inside the conjunctiva using red knife or ear knife until healing occurs.
The Seventeenth Chapter.
In cutting the periosteum and what grows as excess tissue in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red flesh may grow together until it covers the eye or comes close to or spills over the eyelids. It might cause the eyelids to turn outward and resemble the appearance of the gull's beak.
And in doing so, you have the patient place his head on your bench, then open his eyes and collect all that red flesh using instruments suitable for this task.
Or you may hold it with a hook or a spatula, then cut the first piece of flesh step by step until all is removed by cutting and take care not to harm the eye during this process. Your cuts should either be made using the filet knife described for removing the knuckle bone or with a small scalpel. Like this illustration you'll see in the following page of how these tools look and function.
Once your cuts are done and all the periosteum is removed, fill the eye with saltwater or sprinkle it with red powders and other cooling medicinal substances. Then apply a piece of white cotton from outside to cool down any inflamed lump.
If any periosteum remains, or if there is a clot and you fear a hot lump, leave the eye alone and treat it with what calms the lump. Then return to your work until healing occurs. Likewise, do this for excess flesh that appears in the eye like this.
Except that you should avoid treating every weak eye through writing or by displaying, do not engage in operations with iron tools. Do not involve yourself in these works until you see the possibility of that organ for this work.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the section of removing obstacles from the eye.
Obstacles are red vessels that weave on the eye, preventing vision and weakening the eye over time. It is necessary for you first to observe; if the eye with the obstacles is strong and does not have another disease besides the obstacles.
And then the procedure is to instruct the patient to place his head on your knee. Then hang those vessels by a single string or two according to your skill, and let the strings be gentle in their bending for this image:".
Or have two double strings in one body like this:
Then, using a gentle pair of scissors with care and gently wipe out the blood at intervals until you see that these vessels have disappeared and the blood has evaporated. Be cautious not to harm the eye with the edges of the scissors and let your work be half a day facing the sun.
And be very careful in your work so as not to cut anything other than those vessels. When you are finished, sharpen over the green or red scab in the eye to eat up what is left of the obstacles. If you cannot cut it all at that moment, bandage the eye to soothe the pain of the eye.
And leave him for days until the pain subsides and heals the hot lump. Then, repeat this work on her in exactly the same way until this image of the scissors' pain disappears from her.
And leave it [and the master's head will be on the student's stone, and the other will shed tears and achieve clarity in the front of the eye and its tip] at the beginning of action by opening the eyes with fixed or triangular openings that hold them.
Fully focused, and the master's head is on the student's stone, and the other sheds tears achieving clarity in the front of the eye and its tip. By choice, you can start with clipping from above the eye or below it, the first option is to shed two tears from the upper snout; one at the end of the crest, and the other at the beginning.
And hold it between the middle and the thumb, then attach tubes from below against them. Then hold it between the shaft and the nail. Lift your hand lightly firmly until you see all the threads have risen. If you are using a scissor, cut from the smaller western side if needed. If using a gentle pair of pincers instead.
And enter the needle into its eye and pass all threads until it rises above the gauze, do not cut the tears because if you shed tears or blood will leak onto your face.
Then cut with the scissor what exceeds the crest both from above and below so that nothing remains except a slight one in the cornea, if possible you can remove it from the cornea by peeling with the blade, this is better as some people find it easy.
And when you cut him, his beard will heal for days until the pain subsides and calms any heat of the tumor, then repeat the operation on him.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In retracting the feather towards the nose.
Physicians refer to the feather as a thorn, if it is treated with fire or burned medicine as previously described and it does not heal. Then there is no trick but to cut through the tumor when it has fully matured and extract all the moisture in it or pus.
Until the bone is revealed. If the bone is revealed and you see corruption or blackness in it, remove it using this device.
And the iron head of the drill is called the drill head, made of Indian iron. Its tip is cylindrical like a nail with a fine engraving similar to that of a chisel or an awl. You place it on the rotten area of the bone and turn it between your fingers while slightly moving your hand until you know that this decay has been removed.
And you do this several times, then apply the dried compress medicine on the spot. If the wound closed and grew back flesh, stopped bleeding after a certain period, and remained for forty days without any recurrence or incident happening there.
Know that he has been cured, otherwise there is no trick other than to return the nose piercer into the nasal passage in this manner. This involves revealing the bone again with iron or a sharp medicine; if the bone is revealed, take it out using this tool:
The tip of the tool is triangular and its shaft is conical, tapering towards the tip as you can see. Place it on the actual bone itself; place this close to your nose and slightly away from your eye with your hand. Then move your hand with the tool until the bone penetrates and one feels it through the patient.
And if, when you hold your hand over his nose, the wind finds it coming out, then apply the dried compress medicine on the spot as I taught you. If flesh grows and hardens in that place, the substance that used to project outward returns into the nasal passage. This will be more comfortable for the patient if God wills.
The twenty-first chapter.
Repair the eye wound.
If the eye is hurt by its blow, and does not cause harm or loss in sight, it should be made easier then developed in depth. Then it should be placed on the forehead without a condition and treated with gentle care.
Then place a soft poultice made of dough, patience, milk and fat on the eye. Then pull up the eyelid from above with many bandages. The recipe for the bandages is to take much gentle burnings which bend every breach into four folds, making many.
Then place one on top of another according to how much the eye requires, then pull it with a strong hard thread tightly. The poultice is reapplied without any condition. Then remove the poultice and leave the eye bound day and night.
If the ligament relaxes during this time, it should be tightened again. After one day and night as we said, if I see that the eye has returned to its normal state; otherwise, reapply the bandage, the bandages, tightening, and poultice until you see a return.
The twenty-first chapter.
In cutting the anbija (a type of walnut).
If a furt (a type of cleft) appears in the walnut layer, then it penetrates and sticks out outside the eyes as if they were walnuts, disfiguring the human appearance. If you want to cut it, do so according to what I describe.
He is to insert a needle into the root of the walnut from bottom to top, then insert another needle with two threads in the opposite side and pull it through. The first needle should be left as it was.
Then cut the site of the doubled suture, attaching some onion around the needle and pulling it tightly. Then remove the needle and place on the eye a wool soaked in egg white until the threads with the onion fall off. Then treat the eye to strengthen it.
Until the wound heals, pull the onion in every direction from a loop of string until the eye becomes tender. Then gently squeeze with a thin forceps reaching to the corner of the eye so that the egg white water flows out and the eye falls down and blisters stay on place, then pull it until it heals.
The Second Twenty-First Chapter.
In treating the hump.
This condition, which is called a hump, is nothing but the accumulation that occurs in the eye resembling water that has fallen but without moisture. The reason for working on it is to place the patient upright on a stool, then hold their head with your hands from both sides.
Move it until you see the accumulation go down into your eye, then keep it in place and it won't move. The light will shine through and the patient will be able to see things as they did before. If it doesn't go down we understand that it is water. If the condition isn't ready for the descent of the accumulation as described, we realize this from its state.
Otherwise, sit the patient between your hands. Then take a thin forceps and make a small incision above the corneal membrane near where the eyelid touches the corneal membrane in the inner corner of the eye until you can remove the matter.
When it comes out, there is a hot water in the eye that has mixed honey or boiled with milk and honey. Then treat with all other remedies until it heals.
Chapter Thirteen
We have mentioned the types of water in this section and which ones are suitable for drinking, explained clearly. Take it from there for your health's sake, so you should sit with your container facing the light near the sun when done.
And hold the correct eye tightly, then lift its lid with your left hand if the eye with water is the left eye or with your right hand if the right eye has water.
Then place the tip of the drinking tube close to the eyelash with a firm pressure near the white part of the eye from the side of the inner corner, then push the drinking tube with force while turning it with your hand until it penetrates into the white part of the eye and you feel that the tube has reached an empty space.
It is necessary that the depth of the drinking tube be as far as the distance from the child to the end of the blackness, which is the eyelash. You will see the copper in the same vision as the eye for the clarity of the conjunctiva membrane, then lift the drinking tube upwards to the place where water is located.
Then press it down repeatedly, if the water flows from its cup then the patient sees what was opened to his vision in his cup and the drinking tube is in his eye. Then he should rest for a while, if the water rises then you press it again without removing the drinking tube.
And when it stabilizes and does not rise, gently remove the drinking tube while slightly moving your hand with it. Then dissolve a little of the inner sea salt in water and wash the eye from inside. Afterwards, place all or part of an outer cotton ball saturated with water on the outside of the eye.
Oil, wax from a bird's egg and its white part are tied with the correct eye, while my contemporaries and those of our time place ground cloves along with the egg white on it. If the piercing tool does not penetrate the eye due to its hardness, because there are people whose eyes are so hard. You should take the forceps which is called 'the bird' and this is its picture:.
Pierce it with the bird only, do not dig deeply into the wound. It is just that you should gently touch the piercing tool in a soft spot, then enter the tool as we mentioned. When your work is complete, prepare for the patient to lie down firmly and sleep on his back in a dark room.
refrain from all movements and coughing, make his food softer than what softens its nature, and do not move his head left or right. Keep the bandage in place until the third day, then let him heal in that dark room and try his sight.
Show him objects, then remove the bandage until the seventh day. It should not be done during the healing period or immediately after piercing your surgery. Instead, avoid it before the water rises quickly with intense looking.
If a hot mass appears, it may be necessary to release the eye before the seventh day. This can be done by settling the mass until it settles. Then you can allow his vision and put a veil on his face which he will practice looking through from under it for days while he is in that dark room, then.
He leaves the house gradually and deals with its affairs. Know that in drilling, a learner cannot do without seeing sometimes. At those times, he will undertake work, and I have heard from some Iraqis that they make a draining tool in Iraq that absorbs water.
I have not seen anyone in our country do this or read about it in any of the early books. Perhaps this is new, and this is a picture of types of amputations that one stands on due to their ignorance.
Copper is made especially for it, and its end is of this smoothness, with a triangular tip that is sharp.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of bleeding flesh in the nose.
It may grow in the nose various types of flesh, some resembling two-legged spiders with many legs. Some of it is a cancerous bleeding flesh that turns red like blood, and there's also normal flesh that isn't like blood.
If such soft flesh is not malignant or cancerous, it should be exposed on your palm facing the sun, open its mouth and introduce the pincers into that flesh, then pull it out. Cut off what you have identified with a thin sharp scissor from one side.
Until you are sure that all the flesh has gone, if there's something left that you can't cut, remove it with one of the smooth tools gently until nothing is left. If blood overcomes or a hot tumor appears.
Replace it with what should be or if it's a malignant tumor, pierce it until the bleeding stops and all flesh goes away. Then place it in the nose after cutting, water or a drink, if the nose opens and its moisture drains to the throat.
Know that he has been cured, if the moisture is not as expected then know that there is living flesh at the top of the decaying bones which the machine could not reach with the cut. In this case it's necessary to take a thread from cotton that has some roughness.
In it, many knots are tied, and between each knot, there is a length as long as an inch or less. The blind man inserts one end of the thread into his nose with a hook or whatever he can find after making something like a button, then pulls on its wind until it reaches the navel.
And it comes out on his neck. Often, the children of scribes do this action like this; it is something that facilitates those who want to do so, then they gather both ends of the thread: one end which came out over the mouth and the other which remained in the nose.
Then, by spreading the flesh with the knots of the thread, she does this until she realizes that the muscles have broken due to the thread knots. Then she removes the thread and goes to the nose after wiping out the bleeding tip that she got from the Egyptian ointment. She does this for three days or more.
Until the ointment eats up all that's left of the flesh. Then, the last thing in the nose is a tin tube for days until it heals. If an intervention was needed, she used this method to dry out.
And this is a picture of the tool that drips fluids and medicines into the nose:.
It is made of silver or brass, resembling a small, open candlestick with its drip also being the same.
And if you want, the tube can be made closed like a pipe, and the surface of the tool that drips is flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, it holds it when the oil or whatever you want from juices or liquid things heats up in it.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
In the growing ulcers at the tip of the nose.
It frequently grows in the end of the nose a nasal polyp which increases and grows with time until it spoils its appearance.
For this reason, it is necessary to remove it as soon as it appears and excise all of it. Then, either use garlic or a burned medicine which serves the purpose of garlic, if it misses being removed at first, until it grows larger. If you see that it has become hard like red skin with little sensitivity, then look into this carefully.
Do not remove it with iron, as it is a cancerous tumor. I have seen many cases where removing this tumor resulted in great harm to its owner. If the tumor is soft and pale without being like red skin, then I saw that removing can be done in entirety. Drain the pus and cut it without hesitation or caution, then treat the site with what dries and constricts until it heals.
The twenty-sixth chapter.
In the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear. If there is a separation of the connection from the wound, or something like that, know that if there is a separation of connection in one of these organs, what affects it depends on some people only.
If you are presented with one of those things, observe if the wound is moistened by its blood, then stitch together the lips of the wound and treat it until it heals. If the separation of connection has completely separated both lips, making each incision healthy, it should be that you excise each incision with a thick layer of exposed skin until it bleeds.
Then stitch the lips together and pull it tight, spreading on them butter and curd as powders. Place something over the protrusions of ointment or any other plasters, and leave it tightened for two or three days, then remove it.
The prescription of medicine and leaving it until the threads break by themselves, then treat it with the ointment until it heals. The stitch description is to gather and separate connections either with the needle as we described in stitching the abdomen or with the thread as you were shown there.
The twenty-seventh chapter.
In releasing the ties that are shown in the two lips.
Many people within their mouths may exhibit small, hard tumors that resemble some pustules of the cherry and others are smaller or larger. It would be advisable to turn the lip over each knot and tie it with thread.
Cut it from each side, then fill the site after cutting with a paste of powder until the bleeding stops. Then rinse with vinegar, salt, and treat the areas until they heal properly.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In cutting the excess flesh in the gums.
Often, there grows excess flesh in the gums which the ancients called "abols". It should be tied with thread or held by a rasp until cut at its root. Leave for bleeding then apply a paste powder on the site.
Or one of the grasping roots that has been dried, if this flesh returns after treatment, it often returns more so cut it again and seal the wound; it does not return after the scarring.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
In removing teeth with iron.
Fouling of teeth surfaces from inside and outside, and between gums, can accumulate hard, unpleasant scales that darken, whiten, or turn green. This decay can extend to the gums causing tooth decay for this reason.
You must sit the patient before you and his head in your stone, and strip the penis and tooth that showed you the scaly thing and the sand-like thing until nothing remains of them. Similarly do this with black substances, green things, white powders, and others until it is cleansed.
If what is inside the initial cleaning has not disappeared, then sheath it again on another day, then twice and thrice until you achieve your goal. You should know that the penis requires various types of sheaths with many shapes according to what suits your task.
In order that the sheath which cleanses inside when used for the penis is different from the one which cleanses outside, and that which cleanses in between takes another shape. These are several types of sheaths that you must have all prepared:.
The thirtieth chapter.
In拔掉牙齿.
It should be treated for its pain with every method and avoid拔out, for there is nothing behind it if it is pulled out, as it is a noble essence, even if pulling it out was necessary.
If the patient insists on拔out, you should wait until the pain of the penis heals. Often, the pain of the penis deceives the patient and they believe that it is in the correct place of the penis, so they拔out. Then, the pain does not disappear until the patient's penis has been拔out. We have seen this from the frequent action of cut-throat surgeons.
If the pain of a specific part of the penis is healed, then you should cut around the tooth with a scalpel with some strength so that it falls from all sides. Then, move it gently with your fingers or soft tweezers, little by little until it becomes loose.
Then he enabled the two large dogs to grip well, placing the head of the patient between his knees which were covered and did not move. Then he pulled on the penis straight so as not to break it, if it didn't come out or else take one of those instruments and gently insert it under him from each side while moving it in the same way that was done initially.
And if the penis is retracted or stuck, it should be filled with a probe and sealed tightly with a soft, fleshy tip so as not to come off while you pull on it with your thumbs. And it should be carefully inspected around the gums from all sides smoothly.
Make your effort carefully so as not to damage it, and some of its force will return to the patient with a pain that is greater than his first one. Do not do what the ignorant surgeons do on their bridge without using what we described.
Many times, they cause great suffering to people instead of simply causing the penis to break and leaving its root completely or partly. Otherwise, it might come off with some of the jaw bones as we have seen many times. After its removal, he drinks a solution or a drink mixed with salt and water. If there is bleeding from that place, it happens frequently; in that case, you should compress a bit of cotton on that spot to stop the bleeding.
Otherwise, remove the cotton if it doesn't help you. The soft image of the thumbs that moves the penis initially should have long fingers and a short handle to prevent bending when you hold them against the penis. This is the image of the large thumbs:.
It should be as you see, with sturdy handles even if you hold them they do not bend or give in short fingers. They should be made of Indian iron or solidly treated steel with pointed ends and a tip that some enter into each other to provide a tight and firm grip.
And limbs can be made like a clamp mechanism, hence they are also strongly controllable.
Chapter Five and Twenty-Three.
In removing the roots of the teeth and extracting broken jaw bones.
If the root of the tooth remains after extraction and has broken, it should be necessary to place cotton saturated with fat for a day or two until the site relaxes. Then introduce the forceps or tweezers into the area. which resembles its tip, like the beak of a bird called a blurrage. This is a picture of forceps:.
They can be made like a pincers from inside, or like an awl. If you should not be able to extract with these forceps, it is necessary to dig into the root and reveal all flesh by the gouge. Then insert the tool that resembles a small peg as shown:.
A short tip is slightly thick and not smooth so as not to break. If the root comes out in this way, otherwise use these other tools whose picture is shown, the first one has a triangular end with some thickness:.
A soft triangular shape:
We may also use this tool with two prongs, and here is its picture as well:.
And with other tools and hammers that are mentioned in the list of tooth removal, we may also use this tool which resembles a large pliers as shown:.
Triangular with a slightly thick tip to prevent it from breaking, it is not smooth. Know that tooth tools are numerous and so are all other tools which are almost impossible to count. The surgeon skilled in his craft may invent tools for himself according to what is suggested by work and diseases themselves.
Because there are diseases which, although they have not been mentioned by their first symptoms, have devices for differing their types, if a bone of the jaw or one of any bones in the mouth has broken, or if it got infected, search in its place with whatever suits him from among these devices and mechanisms that I mentioned in removing the fundamentals.
And we rely on both of his pictures:.
There will be a slight hardness in it which helps to fix the bone so that it doesn't escape until the bone comes out, and we force the position with the suitable medications for this. If there is infection inside the bone, remove its infection and blackness till it cleans then heal it till it becomes clear.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
In spreading the newly growing teeth onto another.
If the tooth grows out of its natural groove, it becomes disfigured in appearance. This is especially noticeable in women and slaves. If one should observe carefully, if a tooth has grown behind another tooth.
If it cannot be spread or pulled back, extract it. If it is stuck to another tooth, cut it using this instrument as shown in the picture:.
It resembles a small beak, made of very sharp iron from India. It should have many cuts due to the hardness of the tooth and not disturb the other teeth. If it's naturally able to pull out then pull it with an Indian tool that is shown in this picture.
Everything is from India, and its engraving is very fine, to be like the tool used for making needles. It slowly cools the tooth for many days with care so as not to disturb the tooth and it falls off. Then you take another one and remove some debris afterwards.
If a tooth has broken and some of it is missing, the tongue gets hurt when speaking. It would be necessary to cool it down until that crack smoothens out. Whether it touches or not, the tongue should not get hurt nor should it distort speech.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In combining movable teeth with threads of silver or gold.
If the old teeth are exposed, they shake and move with a strike or fall, and the patient cannot chew anything for fear of them falling. Treating this with tight fitting remedies did not cure it.
The trick is to tighten a thread of gold or silver, with gold being better as silver corrodes after some days while gold remains unchanged. The thread should be medium in both flexibility and stiffness according to the space between the teeth.
The method of combining teeth involves taking the thread and inserting it between two correctly placed teeth. Then, weave the ends of the thread between the movable tooth(s) one or more times until weaving reaches the correct tooth from the other side.
Then, repeat the weaving from where you began and gently pull your hand to avoid moving the pettite tooth. Make sure that your tension on the thread is at the roots of the teeth so it doesn't slip away. Cut off the excess thread with scissors, gather the ends together, tie them with string and hide them between the correct tooth and the movable tooth.
To avoid hurting the tongue, then leave it like this tied up for as long as it lasts. If it dissolves or breaks, retighten with another thread and you can enjoy it like this throughout your life. This is how teeth look and are combined in two correct teeth and two movable ones as you see:
And it is possible for one or both of the pins to return to their place, intertwine as we described, and remain. This process occurs only when someone who makes a companion nail carries it out; they can carve bone from cattle bones to make its structure resemble the pin and place it in the position where the pin was removed. And it is pulled as we said, remaining and enjoying that.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In cutting the band that is displayed under the tongue, it prevents speech.
This band that is displayed under the tongue may either be naturally born in humans or it could be an accidental result of a healing scar.
The procedure involves opening the mouth of the patient and placing their head on a stone, then lifting their tongue. You cut this muscular band across where it appears, so that the tongue can no longer be held back. If there is some stiffness or complexity in it which comes from a healing scar, you should insert an awl into it diagonally, cutting across until the band loosens and the knot disappears.
Be cautious not to cut too deep into the flesh, risking a blood vessel being severed and causing bleeding. After cutting, rinse the area with rose water or a mixture of vinegar and cold water. Then place a cotton wick under the tongue that the patient holds every night.
So that it does not heal again, should there be bleeding, apply a patch of powdered substance on the spot. If blood predominates, cover the area with a glass cork suitable for this purpose. Then treat him with all the remedies until he recovers.
The thirty-fifth chapter.
In removing the harelip formed beneath the tongue.
A tumour resembling a small leech might occur beneath the tongue. It hinders the tongue from performing its natural functions, and possibly even bones could grow to fill up the mouth. The treatment involves opening the patient's mouth towards the sun and looking at the lump.
If you see it colored like blood or black and hard, without any sensation in the patient, do not expose him to it. For it is cancerous. And if there's a tinge towards whiteness indicating moisture, insert the needle into it gently with scissors, and remove it from all sides.
If the blood flow overpowers your work, place a powdered plaster on it until the bleeding stops. Then return to your work until you can remove it completely. Afterwards, rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with all appropriate remedies until it recovers,".
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of tumors in the breasts.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors may expose glands within the throat that resemble those found outside. If these are named as 'breasts' and treated with what was mentioned in the previous section, they do not heal.
Examine it. If the tumor is hard, colored like blood with little sensation, do not expose it to iron. If it's red in color and tough, also avoid exposure to iron fearing bleeding. Instead, leave it alone until it ripens; either it will subside or it may explode on its own.
And if it's white in color and flat with a soft base, this is what should be cut. In performing the treatment, before you start, observe whether or not it has settled after heat exposure; if it has remained completely still without any movement or if there's been some slight movement.
When that happens, position the patient with his foot towards the sun and his head on your stone, open his mouth, and take a servant in front of you to extract his tongue downwards using this tool, which is its likeness.
You make it out of silver or copper, making it as thin as a knife. When you use it to extract the tongue and reveal any tumor underneath, if it can be seen clearly with your naked eye after that, take an awl and insert it into the uvula, then pull it outward without removing anything from the membrane.
Then you cut it with this tool, resembling a pair of scissors. However, both ends are curved, forming each one's shoe made by the other; they are very sharp. It is made from Indian iron or Damascus steel.
If this tool cannot be prepared, then cut it with these shears:
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting one uvula, cut the other in the same manner, then after cutting, immerse the patient in cold water or saline and water.
If he bleeds, immerse him in water that has boiled with the peels of quinces or asafetida leaves, or similar substances until the bleeding stops. Then treat it until he recovers. It may grow new tumors elsewhere in the throat other than the two uvulae; cut them in the same way as the uvulae.
And a woman was treated for a tumor that had grown inside her throat, touching the voice box so little that it nearly blocked her throat. She was breathing through a narrow passage and had been unable to eat or drink water due to this obstruction.
And she was on the brink of death if she had survived for a day or two, as the tumor had grown twigs that emerged through her nostrils. I acted quickly; I inserted an awl into one of them and pulled it out, extracting a suitable piece.
Then she cuts it where she perceived it through the nasal hole, then did she do that to what protruded from the other nasal perforation. Then she opened her mouth and twisted her tongue. Then she inserted the probe into the body of the tumor, then cut off some of it without removing anything except a little flowing blood.
Then, the woman's hair was released and she acted promptly by drinking water at that time. Then, she ate food, and we kept cutting from that tumor repeatedly for a long period of time. The tumor would leave behind instead of what is being cut until it lasted with her like this.
I opened it and excavated inside the neck tumor operation, then it stopped increasing. Then I left for another direction, and I did not know what Allah did to me afterwards.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In cutting the gallbladder tumor.
The one that is called Figs if it descends to the gallbladder and swells, being white and rectangular. If it's hard at the bottom and cylindrical, then it's called a Figs. If it was treated with what we mentioned in the section but the treatment did not work.
I saw the hot tumor had settled on it, being thin and fragile. It should be cut, for there was no solid aggregation that was compacted, did not have length, was soft or of a prolonged color or black or had no sensation; one must avoid cutting it.
There is a thread on the feeble one. If you see it in the condition I mentioned, with its whiteness and length, the feeble one should be seated with the sun's sandal and his tongue is pressed by the instrument that was described beforehand. Then the probe should be inserted into the fig.
It draws it downwards and cuts it with one of the two devices that I mentioned for cutting the lungs, and it should not be cut beyond what is naturally required without excess; because if you cut more than necessary, you will harm both speech and voice.
Then after the cutting, she uses what we described for cutting the lungs and treats her until she recovers. If there is pus from the one that was not cut, it should be done by the trick in its abdomen without fear or caution. The purpose of the trick is with the sharp medicine; this means to place the tip of the uncut organ on your stone.
Then, she presses his tongue with the tool we mentioned. Then, she takes hot water as described in the chapter on 'killing' and kneads it with an un-sooted grinding stone until it's neither too thick nor too thin. She fills this tool with the mixture, and here is how it looks:
Its end, where the medicine is placed, looks like the grinding of a spoonful of sweetened water. The tool with the medicine should be placed on his tongue itself and the patient lying on their side to allow the saliva inside their mouth drain out without anything descending into their throat which could harm them.
Then, hold your hand with the medicine while you press it on the tongue for about half an hour until you see that it has turned black and calmed the bite of the medicine. If desired, take a cotton thread tie it to one end of the sweetened water stick and soak the cotton in the medicine.
The sweetened water enters the tube from above until the cotton sticks to the tongue. Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired amount of 'killing' of the sore throat, then leave it as it will dissolve and shrink after three or four days. If you need to repeat the medicine, prepare another dose.
After the cut, you should wipe around the wound with a cotton ball soaked in oil and remove any surrounding medicine. Then rinse with cold water. Treating externally with pincers and internally with probes until it heals is safer than cutting and more comforting.
The divine also treats with gentler methods than cutting and amputation. It uses incense on this condition; take zounj, zoafa, sucatr, szzab, shih, babonj, qasam, and similar herbs from the plants. Gather all of them or some of them in a pot and immerse it in oil.
Heat it up and place the pot on a heated surface. In the middle of the lid, make a hole to which you will attach the dehydrator machine on this condition; it is made from silver or copper:.
The end with the ramanah enters the mouth of the patient until the steam rises through the tube to the divine on this pipe, until it softens the divine greatly. Then she repeats it several times until it evaporates, do not make this treatment at the first appearance of the lump.
If it often increases the lump, then you should do this when its hot ramanah decreases. If this machine is not available to you, take a tube and attach an eggshell to its end so that it does not burn the mouth of the patient.
Because the eggshell prevents the hot steam from burning the mouth, and this is good treatment with its safety.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In removing splinters and anything else that might swell in the throat.
Very often, there is swelling in the throat caused by a bone or a thick splinter or something else. It should be removed what is obvious and visible after rubbing the tongue with the machine under sunlight.
Let it show you what is in the throat, and what did not reveal to you and was hidden in the throat. It should be induced to vomit the contents before they are digested in his stomach, for perhaps the disease may come out with vomiting or he might swallow some piece of food or a lump and choke himself.
Or, it might swallow a piece of dry bread or take a small piece of the soft sea sponge. She ties this with a string and he swallows it. When it reaches the place where food is chewed, she quickly pulls the string repeatedly.
Often, the spoon or bone sticks to it and comes out. If it doesn't come out as we mentioned, otherwise use an instrument made of tin like this:.
It should be slightly thicker than the one used for suction and at its tip there is a spoon that he puts in his throat gently while lifting his head upwards, being careful not to touch his windpipe so as not to cause him to cough. He pushes either the bone or the spoon or allows the doctor to insert it with his hand.
Introducing the contents of the stomach to it is better for him to know its place, push it down or pull his hand towards the top with this instrument as far as what suits him until it comes out.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the removal of indigestible matter from the throat.
If the indigestion does not improve with treatment as described in this section using medical remedies, then observe the patient's throat at noon after he has licked his tongue with the instrument you were shown.
If you see the indigestion, then pull it with a small hook or a gentle but firm jawbone. If this does not work, take a curved pipe and insert it into the patient's throat close to the indigestion. Then put a heated rod inside the pipe.
This procedure is repeated several times, and the patient abstains from water for a whole day. Then he takes a cup full of cold water, opens his mouth with it, rinses with it without swallowing even a drop and moves the water in his mouth now and then with his hand.
If the lump feels the water, it falls onto the stool. If it does not come out as described, the throat evaporates urine and sweat with the bellows that was described in blowing for god's sake. Repeat this several times; then it will fall down.
The purpose of using the bellows is to take a quantity that contains fever dust with fire. The quantity should be covered by a cover in its middle, and there should be a hole in it. Then put one end of the instrument into this hole. Place the patient's mouth at the other end of the tube and close their mouth so that they do not exhale the smoke until they feel that the smoke has reached their throat.
The lump falls onto the stool if it does. If not, the process of blowing with the bellows is repeated several times and the patient endures thirst while eating salt and garlic without drinking water; eventually, this method will have to be used for its expulsion. This is a depiction of an instrument that attracts the lump from the throat when it comes into contact with vision.
It resembles the combs as you see, except that it has this combing feature which enters the throat and its tips resemble a bird's beak in it; if it touches something, no matter how small, it will leave no trace.
Another instrument is used to place the tongue and it consists of a wide iron ring that can accommodate the mouth size above the tongue. It enters the mouth standing on one side, causing the mouth to remain open against the will of the patient, and they cannot even force it out until it naturally slips:
The description of the instrument used to open the mouth at this particular measurement.
Chapter Forty.
Therein, he discusses the art of speaking about tumours in the breast and dividing them.
Tumors come in many varieties, each one more sophisticated than the last, as this book will detail them one by one. They vary greatly in their size and division due to two aspects: one being the type of tumor itself and what it contains in terms of moisture content.
The second aspect is due to the locations where they occur in the body, as a tumor developing in the head differs from one occurring in the thigh, and a tumor appearing in a place with flesh differs from one found at a joint. Each of these has its own method of treatment.
Among tumors, some should not be drained until the pus inside has ripened and matured. Others, however, should be drained even if they have not fully ripened, such as those that form near joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and takes time to mature, it might corrupt the ligaments or nerves around that joint. This could lead to disability of that joint or affect an important limb due to its proximity to a crucial body part.
Because if you delay its drainage until it fully matures, you harm the main limb or position it near a joint and drain it immediately. Only when draining the tumor is required immediately, not until it's fully matured, especially close to joints where pus might spread into the thigh cavity becoming an infection.
There are instances where tumors do not heal completely, and you should know when to drain fully developed tumors which occurs at the point of cessation of pain, disappearance of fever, fading redness, decrease in swelling, softening of the tumor head, and other signs.
It is necessary to place the incision at the bottom of the tumor's location if possible, so that the pus flows down more easily and from a lower or most sensitive part of the tumor. The incision should be made longitudinally along the body if tumors are in areas like arms and legs.
In places of muscles, tendons, nerves and arteries as well as in all level areas without bending, and if the area bends then the incision should follow that shape. However, if the tumor is in fatty areas it's better to leave an incision there.
Until it dries as we said till completion, if you make the incision before this stage then there will be a lot of pus draining from it and it will be dirty. There might even be scarring on its edges, and some tumors may make an incision across the body when necessary or according to what the organ needs.
It is necessary to use one incision for small tumors and several large or multiple cuts for larger ones, according to the size of the tumor. Some tumors might require skin removal and cutting if they have become like wounds.
It has reached a point where it resembles what is seen in many abscesses and hiding places, from which there are cuts with three angles and from which it can cut like the shape of an ace card as in the case of the arbi tumor.
Some require circular cuts and crescent-shaped cuts, and other types of cuts. If the tumor does not have a head like the flattened round tumors, then it's better to make just one simple incision. And if the tumor is very large and has had an extended duration, then don't rush in opening it all at once so that the pus can be released completely during that time.
First remove some of it, then pull on the tumor until another day. Then also drain out some pus. Do this repeatedly and progressively until all is removed.
And especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an elderly person. The life force tends to dissipate with the release of pus in waves; thus, it might happen that the patient dies without you noticing. Be very cautious about this aspect.
After boiling these tumors, one should wipe the wound and inspect it. If the tumor's wound is small or there is a simple incision, use cotton wool or old cotton. However, if the tumor is large, and there are many incisions from boiling, then...
In each incision, you should insert a wick so that some parts of them connect with each other. If the tumor was excised from the skin or burned, it should be filled with old cotton or dry cotton wool, and then tightened until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the necessary ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs while you are working, use cold water and vinegar after drinking a cotton wick in them, then apply them to the bleeding area several times.
If bleeding persists, you should use the measures and treatments and remedies that we have described in many places in our book and this section. However, if it is winter, and the area of the tumor has many nerves, you should warm the channels with a hot drink and oil.
And place it on the area. If you are in summer and the places are hot, then carry the channels with a drink of water and oil or a drink with oil; all of this should be cold until the third day as we said. Then remove the tumor and wipe it.
In its treatment, whatever is similar until it heals, this is what you need to know about the treatment of tumors in general. As for the details, I have mentioned each tumor how the way to treat it is done, summarized, and laid out step by step.
Chapter forty-one.
In the division concerning tumors that appear on the scalp.
Tumors appear on the scalp, which are small tumors and they belong to the type of products it contains in squamous areas that have characteristics like a chicken's comb and there are many types among them. Some are fatty and others contain moisture similar to pus.
And there are those that contain moisture similar to the sweat and broth, etc., and among them are some that are stone-like and hard. All of them do not pose any danger in their division and removal as long as no artery obstructs you during their division.
And the work in dividing her is to puncture her first with the tool that comes after this image and is called the probe, until you know what she contains. If it contains moisture, then divide her lengthwise cut on this image:
Start by dividing from line ~b~ to line ~g~, if the moisture has drained, remove the sac that contained this moisture and cut it all, leave nothing at all. Often, if something remains, it returns if you do not completely remove it.
Then, immerse a cotton in the clarified honey if it is available or otherwise in salt water and fill the wound with it and leave it for another day, as it eats what remains of the sac. Then, repeat this with cotton dipped in honey again, and thrice if needed.
Until you are sure that nothing remains of the cyst, then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the tumor contains fatty merchandise, cut it in this manner:.
Cut it in a cross pattern and insert the needles into both sides of the wound. Suck it out from every side, use all your effort to extract the pus containing it. If you encounter an artery, do what was described after this step, likewise do the same if the tumor is constricted due to the cut.
The treatment is as stated, cutting into the hard tumor is easier because there is little blood and moisture. It may be that some of these tumors in the head in some people do not have any moisture at all; this is why you cut onto a tumor.
Heard about a woman's old head. The tumor was as hard as the chalky stone, it was flaky white and no one could break it even if they threw it at it with all their strength. Unlike other tumors that occur in the head, this is like the tumors found on young heads.
When it comes to the bases of ears, cut them all in a simple cross pattern and make its opening at the bottom so that the material can easily flow downwards. Then treat it with what suits its treatment.
The second and fortieth chapter.
In cuts on pigs, many of these tumors do show up in the neck and under the elbows, as well as in the armpits. Some also occur elsewhere in the body. There might be one or several of them appearing in the neck, some developing from others.
Every pig with this disease has a special cyst inside it, just as is the case in fatty goods and head tumors as we described. There are many types of pigs suffering from this; some have hard tumors, others contain moisture, and there are also poisonous ones that do not respond to treatment.
What I have seen is good in terms of palpation, and it had a color close to the skin's hue. It would move towards every direction and was not attached to the neck nerve, nor to the lymph nodes, nor to any artery, and did not become abscessed. You should make a simple cut from top to bottom of the body in this manner, from line ~A~ to line ~B~:.
And remove it from every side, stretching the skin with a scalpel or two, or many if necessary, as we explained about swellings in the head. Remove it slowly, slowly, so that there is no cutting of sweat glands or nerves and may the edge of the instrument not be too sharp.
So as not to increase your hand with cuts or worry the patient, cut what you do not need to cut. If you cut a sweat gland or an artery and are hindered from working, place a powder or some seeds that stop bleeding in the wound.
Pull the wound tight and leave it until the tumor's pain subsides and the wound relaxes, then begins to heal. Blood flow stops at that point. Return to your work until you finish. Then use your middle finger if there is any left, then smaller tweezers to remove and clean them.
If there is a large sweat gland at the root of the pig, it should not be cut from its origin but it should be tied with two thin threads and left until it falls out on its own without harm. Then stuff the wound with used cotton that has been dipped in Egyptian perfume, then treat it.
If you cut the pig completely, it should be that you bring together the edges of the wound and sew it after knowing that there is no trace left of fat. If I saw that there was still some fat left from the pig bone.
In performing cuts, one must aim for the original position and direction of tissues. Use stitches, as we have described them, along with anything else suitable. If the pig contains moisture, bathe it slightly where you can see its ripening area. Make sure the bathe is located below what is mentioned.
Then, after the bath with the baby soap or similar items, allow it to eat what is left of the decay until you see that the wound has cleaned. After that, cleanse it using herbal ointments for the stomach until it fully heals.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In making a cut in the throat over a tumor that occurs within the larynx.
I mentioned this cut in the throat at first, and I have not seen anyone in our country perform it; this is their way of speaking. However, those with stomachaches should avoid making a cut in the throat because they do not benefit from that.
In order for all the tubes and lung to be free, while those who have a hot tumor in the mouth or throat or tonsils where the cause is not due to the tube need to use a cut in the throat to escape from the discomfort that comes from choking.
If we wish to do this, we should cut the throat under three or four circles of the windpipe, making small cuts between two circles. The cut should be in the diaphragm and not in the cartilage; this position is suitable for the cut.
Because it is devoid of flesh and blood vessels are far from it, if the surgeon is bold, he should extend the throat skin with a stitch first. Then cut the skin until it reaches next to the windpipe where there are blood vessels; if he sees anything.
Then he cuts the duct as we described, and determines to cut the phlegm tube by what comes out with it when it moves around along with the interruption of voice. The wound is left open for a period of time. Once the period in which suffocation was feared has passed, his lips gather together from the skin.
And he operates on it alone without cartilage, then uses the medicines that promote wound healing until it heals. He, the author of this book, explains this sentence we narrated: If they saw that the pus-filled lesion had closed off his throat, then it was one of these lesions they mentioned.
The pus-filled lesion was about to die, and they thought it would suffocate. So they proceeded to cut the throat so that the pus-filled lesion could breathe on its wound and survive death. They were instructed to leave the wound open until the illness progresses through three stages, or approximately this duration.
Then they were instructed to sew up the wound and treat it until it healed. I witnessed this personally; a servant took a knife and sent it towards her throat, cutting part of her bronchus. She was referred for treatment and found to be gurgling like a slaughtered animal, from which it was determined that she had an exposed wound.
I found that the blood coming from the wound was minimal. I realized she hadn't cut her throat or trachea; air was escaping through the wound, causing her to gurgle. She healed and treated the wound until it recovered. The servant only experienced difficulty in speaking, no more than that.
She recovered after a few days to her best condition, so we can say that severing the throat poses no danger.
Chapter Forty-Four.
In the incision on the tumor that is presented from outside in the ring, it is called the ring worm.
This tumor, which is called the ring worm, is a large body-colored mass that is very common in women and it has two types.
Either it's naturally occurring or it's due to an external cause. In the case of natural occurrence, there is nothing one can do about it. When caused by external factors, it has two forms: One resembles fatty tumors and the other resembles a tumor that results from constrictions in veins; in which case there is danger in the incision. It should not be cut with iron, except for the small ones. If you probe and inspect it with a probe, its appearance resembles fatty tumors; they are not attached to any part of the body tissues. Cut them as you would cut fatty tumors. And remove it along with whatever is contained in its sac if it's inside a sac, otherwise, extract all of it then treat the affected area according to what is appropriate for treatment.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the incision on types of fatty tumors.
Fatty tumors are numerous and I have mentioned all of their types in the previous section. It is necessary to clarify here the difference between fatty tumors and abscesses, which can be problematic. To state that an abscess often comes with fever and chills until the desire for food subsides after its formation. The pus continues to spread until the fever and pain subside. Fatty tumors do not have any fever, chills, or discomfort with them; instead, they contain a thin fatty sac which has its own characteristic consistency. They have various colors and start like a mustard seed but grow as large as a walnut and smaller.
This is of two types, either fatty or containing moisture. The moisture's quantities vary as mentioned in the division; thus, upon beginning treatment for the product, it should be pricked and inspected first with a tool named the probe, which shall follow this chapter outlining its appearance.
Measure the size of the tumor, then insert the probe and observe what emerges. If it is a watery substance, regardless of its color, make a simple incision as you would for other tumors as described elsewhere. If no moisture emerges from the probing, know that it is fatty.
Make a hard incision on it as shown in this image, as I taught you. Secure it with clips and gently peel the skin from all sides. If possible, remove the tumor intact along with its contents.
If the sac breaks during the operation and it is unable to be removed intact, this often leads to complications. Remove it in pieces until nothing remains. If any part of it stays behind, whether a little or much, the tumor will likely recur.
If only a little remains after your operation, it's important to clean the wound thoroughly with some sharp, concentrated acids and apply pressure on it. Then treat it further for any inflammation with other forms of therapy until it heals completely. If the tumor is large, however, draw lines on its edges and treat it using methods that promote healing.
If a harmful or non-harmful sweat appears and causes bleeding, act promptly by treating the area with powdered bandages and leave them tightly in place for two to three days until the wound heals and the bleeding subsides. Then you can proceed with further removal of what is left of the tumor.
The forty-fourth chapter.
In the images of the machines.
Those that operate in the cut and depth of it, are images of drills, and they come in three types, large ones, medium-sized ones, and small ones.
Image of a large drill:.
Image of an intermediate drill:.
Image of a small drill:.
It is made of iron in the shape of a square with tight sides to facilitate entry into tumors; these are images of scalpels and they are called cold ones, also coming in three types like drills: large ones, medium-sized ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel:.
Image of an intermediate scalpel:.
Image of a small scalpel:.
It is suitable for examining tumors, wounds, sinuses, and cavities about what is inside them from bones and the like. It is made as a polished smooth rotating tool like tongs from Chinese or Spanish brass or from brass or iron or silver, with the best being one made of Spanish steel.
Scalpels can also be made from black lead, and it is suitable to use in sinuses that have a valve inside them for guiding the lead smoothly, even with this valve. They are also divided into three types: one that extends through, one that is medium-sized, and one that ends short.
The size of the cavity for each sinus is determined according to its size and narrowness, an image of a large lead scalpel:.
Image of an intermediate lead scalpel:.
A picture of a small metal scalpel.
Pictures of the needles, which come in many types, since some are simple, meaning those that have one fillet. They are divided into three major types, intermediate and small ones. Among them are blind needles with three varieties. Also, there are needles with two fillets; these also have three types. There are doubly tipped needles that are also pointed. And there are three types, among them needles with three fillets; they also come in three types. Each of these types has its place, and a simple large needle is shown here. A picture of an intermediate-sized needle. A picture of a small simple needle.

A picture of an intermediate needle with three grooves. A picture of a small needle with three grooves.
And these are the scalpels that cut and incise goods and tumors, there are three types among them; some are large, others are medium-sized, and some are small. A picture of a large scalpel is shown here.
A picture of an intermediate scalpel.
Small operating theater image.
Her needles are limited in size and her other ends are unlimited. She is designed this way to aid in the removal of goods when there's fear of cutting a vein or nerve. It allows for some relief from the burning sensation one feels during tumor removal.
These are the depictions of the needles, and they come in three types: some are large, others are medium-sized, and there are smaller ones. Picture of a large needle:.
It is made from a type of malleable copper that bulges outwards and in each end, there's a broad spoon-like utensil with an embedded forceps blade in its head. The blade resembles the tongue of a bird and can be moved into and out of it whenever one desires as seen.
Photos of the forceps that are concealed between fingers during the removal of tumors, they don't bother the patient. There are three types; some are large, others are medium-sized and there are smaller ones. Picture of a large pair of forceps:.
Pictures of the clamps used to stop bleeding, they come in three types; some are large, others are medium-sized and there are smaller ones. Picture of a large clamp:.
They are made of copper or slightly elongated Chinese wheels as you see, and they should be to the touch. It is necessary for these types of forceps to be both large and small with you so that you can quickly cut off blood when needed and when medicine is not available.
However, do not use in blood cuts in every part of the body, rather use it in fatty areas such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, arm muscle, breast, abdomen, and the genital area, among other wet fatty organs.
And you can make others of it that are smaller, resembling the walnut shells as shown in this image:.
It is used to stop bleeding if there is a leak at the cut site or when cutting a sweat gland or artery. It can also be made into a wheel-like device as shown in this image:.
The seventy-fourth chapter.
In the nipple oil of men.
The one that resembles the women's nipples can swell up to a certain level of the dream in some people until it resembles the women's nipples, remaining warm and rough. If someone dislikes this, they should cut across the nipple like a crescent moon on this shape.
From line B to line G:. Then, scrape off all the fat. Fill the wound with ointment for healing. Stitch up the wound's edges and treat it until it heals. If the breast drops down due to its size as in women.
It would be necessary to cut in its upper borders with two cuts resembling a semicircular shape, each one connecting to the other at their ends, so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one as shown in this image:. From line B to line G, then cut the skin that is between the two cuts and remove the fat. Use the stitching and buttons we mentioned as well as any other treatments needed until it heals.
If you do not remove what needs to be removed for the sake of a patient's anxiety or due to bleeding, then it is necessary to stuff the wound with cotton dipped in garlic ointment. Leave it until the remaining fat has been consumed. Then treat it until it heals.
The forty-fourth chapter of the eighth.
In cases where tumors appear below the elbow.
These tumors that appear below the elbow are of pig type, containing a sac. Some of them contain moisture. What should be done if they contain moisture is to make a semicircular cut in this way.
From line ~b~ to line ~g~, if all the contents of the tumor have been drained over time, stuff it with dry cotton and leave it until another day, then remove the cotton.
And treat with the appropriate ointment until it heals, if the tumor is of the pig knot type, cut it as we mentioned for the cut on pigs. Either way, when the wound extends to the point of pus discharge, use fire on it as we have explained in what was previously mentioned,
The forty-fourth chapter of the ninth.
In the case of a tumor that appears due to the artery or vein and is called aneurysm.
If the artery is injured and the skin above it heals, it often leads to a tumor appearing. Similarly, it can also lead to a tumor in veins experiencing dilation and a tumor.
And the signs by which one can tell if a tumor or dilation is caused by an artery or vein: If the tumor results from an artery, it tends to be more widespread and deeper in the body. When you press on the tumor with your finger, it feels bumpy as if there's something solid beneath the surface.
The one that is before the veins becomes a lying tumor in the body surface, and the cut on these tumors is dangerous, especially in the wrists, elbows, armpits, necks, and many other places of the body. The latter was huge indeed; it is advisable to avoid treating them with iron.
And there was also in the limbs or on the head, it is advisable to avoid. Whatever of swelling of the artery, cut in its skin by length and then open this cut with slits, then incise the artery and remove clots from it.
Until it is revealed, then insert a needle and conduct it to the other side and pull the artery with two stitches in two places as you demonstrated in making incisions on both arteries which are situated beneath the collarbones. Then crush the area between the ligaments until all of the blood comes out.
The tumor then dissolves, and treatment that produces pus is used until the ligaments fall off. Then it is treated with ointments suitable for this, until complete recovery.
If the tumor is before the vein cut, it is advisable to hold as much of the tumor with your hand as possible along with the skin. Then insert a needle below where you have held with your hand and pass it through, having two threads in it, until it comes out from the other side. Then you should tie the tumor tightly, as I described to you in tying a bunch of grapes with both ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads might slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole tumor at the point where the first needle crosses.
Pull your threads in four places, then cut the tumor in its middle until what's inside is out. Cut off some extra skin and leave what was attached to it. Then put on a dressing that you have soaked in wine and oil. Then treatment is done with sutures and ointments until it heals.
The fiftieth chapter.
In the tumor that shows spinal cord irritation.
Just as a tumor may appear in the artery or vein, so too can it appear in the nerve if there is an injury to it or excessive fatigue or something like that. It is more common in areas where nerves are compressed or obstructed.
And wherever the joints move, there is a moving tumor that resembles the color of the rest of the body and it is usually without pain. If one presses hard on it, one feels an anesthesia-like sensation. The tumor does not congregate deeply within the body.
But it is beneath the skin and moves in every direction, not going forward or backward. Wherever there are joints, it should not be exposed to iron because it might cause damage. And where it is on the head or forehead.
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, hold it with tweezers and cut it off at its root. If it's large, attach it to an iron ring, remove it, then pull it out and sew up the wound until it heals.
The fifty-first chapter.
In cutting the hernias that appear in the abdomen.
Many people have experienced hernias in their bellies and other parts of their bodies. These are called 'fungus' hernias because they somewhat resemble fungi. They start off thin and have a thick head that may have turned inside them. Some of them are small, while others become very large.
I have seen a man with two hernias that resembled things like mushrooms. They were slightly different in color and were thin at the base, having thick heads which had turned inside them and cracked. Moisture continuously flowed from them. I cut both of them; the weight of one was about sixteen ounces, while the other weighed around six ounces.
When performing amputation, one should observe if the pus is wet and if the color of suppuration is pale white and delicate. Cut it with a broad blade scalpel and ensure that your tool is heated by fire frequently; often does it bleed out much blood when being cut.
If the bleeding is excessive, stanch it. If you see that the pus is thick and fears the cutting with iron, take a firm lead thread and tighten on this suppuration which has this characteristic, leave it for two days then increase tightening of the lead thread; the lead thread will continue to tighten.
Every time it penetrates the pus until it breaks and falls out from itself without effort, if the pus is dense in origin then when cutting some fear and wax may be found especially those in abdomen but it might be possible to cut half of it or some parts.
Then stanching to ensure it doesn't recur, then treat until the wound heals. Be cautious not to expose it to pus that resembles a thread with little sensitivity and a suspicious appearance, as it is a form of cancer. We will provide details on cancer after this.
The second and fiftieth chapter.
In treating hernias.
Hernias can be caused by many factors, either from the splitting of the abdominal wall which leads to protrusion or protrusion of the intestines in other cavities and also from bleeding that comes out of a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or from wind that becomes trapped there.
If it is due to the splitting of the abdominal wall and protrusion, then the color of the tumor resembles the body's color and it appears yellowish without pain and manifests differently in position. And if it is due to the passage of pus, its condition differs greatly from what we described. If you press it with your fingers and then it disappears but comes back, there might be a lump inside and may increase significantly upon going to the bathroom or severe fatigue. If it was due to moisture previously, it would be slimy.
And it does not disappear when you press it, neither increases nor decreases in size. If the cause was bleeding, this tumor will turn black with these signs appearing. If the cause was a raw piece of meat, the tumor will be hard and solid, firmly attached to one spot.
And if the cause was wind, it would be slimy when touched. In working on this, you should observe: If the symptoms arise from blood of the artery or vein or wind, it is advisable to refrain from treating it for fear and desire as I informed you in the chapter about tumors that occur due to arteries and veins.
And if the symptoms arise from pus or infection, it is advised to instruct the patient to stand still and upright, stretching out his limbs. Then you should examine around the lump thoroughly using a stick. Then, ask him to lie between your hands on his back. Then, use a broad clamp around the lump at the spot you've instructed with the stick. Extend the middle of the tumor upwards with a large needle. Then, tie the clamping position with strong thread or silk ribbon tightly.
The knot of the band should be elastic. Then, open the center of the compressed tumor above the band and insert your dominant finger inside it to find the pus. If you find that the pus has been absorbed by the band, relax the elasticity and push the pus back into the abdomen. If you find an infection, pull it out with a needle.
Cut off his superfluous parts, if a vessel or an artery obstructs you during the operation, bind it tightly and continue your work. Take two needles and put in them two strong threads, then enter these two threads into the knot that you have made around the tumor on its two sides which you previously cut out. Then pull the tumor up at four places with the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the position until the tightened flesh dries out and falls off on its own or cut it if it becomes hard and dried. Then treat it with what is appropriate from ointments until it heals. If the passage in the artery was caused by fresh meat inside it.
Or if it's due to moisture, as we have said, you should remove the tumor and then drain out any blood or moisture you find there. Then treat it with something that will heal the affected area.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
In treating cancer.
We have mentioned in the section the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines, warning against treating it with iron as it might cause inflammation. We also mentioned the cancer that originates in the womb and warned against its treatment.
And we have mentioned that when cancer is in a place that can be completely removed, like in the breast or thigh areas and other body parts capable of being extracted as a whole. Especially if it's small and initial. But when it advances and becomes large, it should not be approached.
If I could not heal anyone from it, and before me there was no one who reached this stage, and the work in it should progress as we explained, to advance gradually alleviating the darkest of times several times, then to refine it if it fills the veins with a clear liquid.
Then the surgeon sets up the patient in a position that enables him to work, then inserts tubes suitable for him into the cancer. Then he cuts around them with the skin until nothing remains of its roots and allows the blood to flow without quickly cutting it off.
Then press the places and drain all of the thick blood with your hand or whatever tool you can use. If a great bleeding occurs during your work, it's a sign that a major artery or vein has been cut; stop the bleeding by pressing until blood stops, then treat him with all other remedies until he recovers.
The forty-fifth chapter.
In treating tuberculosis.
Perhaps we were informed about the types of bleeding, how water comes together and signs for each type, as well as treatment with medicines. The one that is treated only with iron is the hemorrhagic type alone; it does not mix with iron the blood-stopping type or the purely fleshly type at all.
That is lethal, if you have treated this type of tuberculosis which is hemorrhagic with medicines and the treatment did not work. Check whether the patient has overexerted himself or has another disease besides tuberculosis such as having an infection.
Coughing or diarrhea and such, you should treat him with iron as it is a double-edged sword. If I see that the patient has abundant strength without any other disease besides tuberculosis, and he is not a child nor an old person, then in dealing with him, ensure he stands between your hands. And have the attendant stand behind him and squeeze his belly with their hands, pushing the water downwards towards the elbow area. Then take a scapular lever in this position:.
Limiting the two ends for a long time, defining the edge like a cutter, except that there is some grease slightly to prevent it from harming when used against the intestines. If the seedling is generated from the side of the intestines.
You should separate by the cut in her abdomen three fingers down from her sole above her knee. If the seedling originated due to a liver disease, let your cut be as wide as three fingers in her abdomen region. If it is due to a gallbladder issue, make the cut on the right side up to three fingers.
It should also not be that the cut is on the side where the patient wants to lie, lest urine flows into this weak area, then pierce with the instrument all over the skin and enter your device in that cut lifting your hand.
Between the skin and bladder as if you are peeling it, the amount of peeling should be like that of a fingernail or similar. Then puncture the bladder until the instrument reaches an empty place which is where the water is. Afterward, remove it, then enter your device in this hole as shown.
It is somewhat like a tube made of thin metal, either silver or copper or polished steel. It has a small hole at the bottom and two holes on each side - two together one alone as you see.
And it may place its tip, like the tip of a quill pen, in this way as shown:.
In its top end, there is a loop. If the device reaches water, it releases it from its reservoir onto the device at that time. It extracts the water for an average amount of time because if you extract more than what should be during this period, it might cause death due to the release of the animal's soul.
If he is suffering from a coma close to death, one should evacuate him according to his strength and what his condition indicates in terms of heart rate and the quality of his complexion. Then, remove the machine and hold back the water because he holds back during his time.
Because of the skin that holds the hole in the lung, as I informed you to stop it on this condition, then repeat the operation another day if I see that the patient can bear it.
And also drain a small amount of water, do this over days while you are monitoring him closely to avoid mistakes, until only a little water remains. If I fear for the patient and leave some water behind, bury it in hot sand.
And excessive sweating in the steam room and sunlight, causing him to endure thirst, treating him with dried medicines until he recovers, and soothing his stomach, liver, and gallbladder after removing water as described previously.
The fifty-fifth chapter.
In the treatment of children born with urination places that are not intact or when the hole is narrow or in an incorrect position.
Sometimes, some newborns come out from their mother's womb and vagina without being intact; it is necessary to act quickly on the hole of its birth hour.
The cauterizer is extremely fine in this case:.
Then, insert a very fine lead pin into the hole and secure it. Leave it in place for three or four days. If nature directs towards urination, push it back; otherwise pull it again. If the lead wears out, then it's possible that urine flowing past its place might not leave it and close it.
And if the hole is narrow, it is treated with lead as we have mentioned, for many days until it widens. And there are among them those whose hole is in an inappropriate location; this being that some of them are born and the hole is at the end of the bladder so they cannot urinate forward.
Until he lifts the epididymis with his hand above and does not beget before that, when the semen cannot reach the womb on a straight path, it is an extremely bad reason. The purpose of this is that he should lie down on his back during the process.
Then, extend it several times with your left hand intensely and cleanse the head of the epididymis with a saw or a sharp large penknife as if you were carving something to have its center like a kidney, so that the hole should occur in the middle as necessary.
And you should be cautious in your work to prevent excessive bleeding, for it often exposes the risk of clotting and treating the wound until it heals.
The sixtieth chapter.
In the urine that appears in the bladder, urethra, and prostate, causing inflammation and adhesion of the bladder to the urethra.
This urine often appears in the epididymis, which is a fleshy tube of the spermatic duct. It can be putrid or non-putrid; the non-putrid should be attached to a gentle string.
And cut it until you clean it all, then apply cotton soaked in Egyptian vaseline on it. Then treat it with alabaster ointment afterwards for healing. If the urine is putrid and of a foul smell, after cutting and removing it, you should use cautery on it.
If the urine is in a fatty abdomen and it has not mixed, with some inside the cavity and some outside, it should be removed that which is inside first until it disappears; then the one from outside becomes active.
Because if you treat them together, the cavity might rupture, and it may also occur in women and in the cavity, there may be darkness and decay. It is necessary to remove all that has darkened and that may cause decay or has already decayed.
Then apply mud on it, followed by honey with peels of grated and cleaned pomegranate, and carseena. Then treat it with all other remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use kyee (a type of herbal medicine) using a Halaliyyah (a specific tool or technique) in this manner:.
If the kyee (a type of herbal medicine) benefits both situations, that is, bleeding and wounds when they have gone bad, if the kidney has consolidated and gone away completely at some point in time, it should be introduced into the urethral passage with a lead pipe to drain off what was applied on it. As for the cavity sticking onto the kidney.
This kind of attachment occurs in those whose cavity is healthy and has not been subjected to stitches. It may result from an injury or a tumor causing it to stick onto the kidney, so it should be removed with cauterizing scissors until the tie is dissolved and the kidney can detach itself from every side.
If it is difficult to distinguish them through examination, it should be advisable to remove a bit from the kidney and the cavity. The cavity is thin; perhaps, it will rupture quickly due to its thinness. Then separate the cavity from the kidney with a fine piece of cotton thread that has been soaked in cold water so as not to stick together also.
Then he treats with a tightening drink until it heals.
The fiftieth chapter seventh.
In cleansing boys and treating what they expose to wrongdoing.
Amputation is nothing other than the separation of connection like all surgeries, but as it comes from our intentional action and its usage in boys especially, we should perform the best operation in it.
The easiest path leading to safety, I say that amputation was not mentioned in any of her books because it was not used in their laws, but rather, it is what we have acquired.
By experimentation, for I found that the majority of surgeons and cutters use Moses's purification and the scissors, they also use folic acid and string bandages, as well as cutting with nails. I have tried all these methods.
I found that purification with scissors and bandaging with string is better than Moses's purification because Moses's purification tends to cause the skin to retreat due to the double layer of the skin. Perhaps I would cut off the upper layer of the skin, leaving the lower layer below.
It often necessitates another cut and persistent pain. Purification with folic acid does not guarantee the removal of the tip of the penis, as it might enter into its hole. As for purification with nails, the skin might tear during your work or the boy's skin is naturally short..
Very often, they are born without the need for purification, I have seen this, and as for purification with scissors and bandaging with string, experimentation revealed to me its superiority because the scissors is proportional in cutting since the blade from above is like the blade from below.
When your hand operates with the compatibility of both teeth cut to a single measure and in one time, it becomes as if you have control over the thread like a wall for the skin of the penis from every aspect. No error will be committed without doubt, and the first purpose is to deceive the child.
And especially if he understands a little that you are only tying the thread on his penis and letting him rest for another day, then make him happy and pleased with all possible means from him, and what is acceptable to his mind. Then stop him in front of you standing tall.
And don't let him sit, hide the scissors in your knee or under your foot, so that the child's eye does not see it on anything or from any of the instruments. Then put your hand inside his penis and inflate the skin until the head of the penis comes out.
Then cleanse it from what accumulates of filth, then tie the designated position with a double thread, then tie slightly below it in a second loop. Then hold with your thumb and the index finger at the lower tying place firmly, and cut between the loops. Then lift the skin upwards quickly and pull out the head of the penis, then let some blood flow as it is better and causes less swelling of the penis. Then wipe it with a wet sponge, and sprinkle on it ashes from burned incense or coriander seeds; they are also beneficial.
Then lift the skin upwards quickly and pull out the head of the penis, then let some blood flow as it is better and causes less swelling of the penis. Then wipe it with a wet sponge, and sprinkle on it ashes from burned incense or coriander seeds; they are also beneficial. Then apply the ointment from above with a sponge dipped in cooked chicken egg yolk mixed with rose water and sweet rose oil, then leave it on until another day. Then treat it with other medications until it heals.
This is a depiction of the scalpel suitable for purification:.
To be a cutting saw without any bend, having a smooth file, and the length of the blades should equal that of the handles. As for the mistake in purification, it might involve completely or partly removing the inner skin during cutting; it would be better to extend this using your finger before the area swells.
And cut it evenly, if you cannot hold it with your finger nail, pull it with a hair tie and cut it. If three days have passed and what remains under the head of the affected area is swollen, leave it until the hot lump subsides, then gently scrape it off.
Cut according to what is suitable for you. Preserve the head of the affected area; if you cut a piece from its head, it won't harm you. Heal it with what helps in healing the wound from the herbs we described in the chapter on herbs.
If more skin is cut than necessary and it retracts above, this also won't harm much. Heal it as we've mentioned until it heals completely.
The fifty-eighth chapter.
In the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder can be due to obstructions caused by stones, coagulated blood, mucus, or absorbed flesh, among other things. Once these issues are treated using the methods described here, various treatment procedures outlined in this section should be applied.
If the urine does not start to flow and I see that its retention due to a stone has affected the neck of the bladder, it would be advisable for him to lie on his elbows. Then one should place their foot on his back and extend their abdomen towards his back while he holds onto himself as much as he can.
When in that case, the neck of the bladder is forced to push out the stone behind, and urine gets expelled. If it doesn't expel as described and the situation becomes severe for the patient, it would be advisable to use an instrument known as catheters, which I will depict here.
It is made of silver, being thin and smooth, resembling a feather quill of birds. It's long like about a yard and half, having a soft bell at its head. There is an attraction for the urine that takes in a looped thread which ties securely to one end with wool or cotton.
One end of the thread enters at the bottom of the catheter and is fastened by the aid if needed some wool, to enter it into the tube sealing it like a plug. Then, grease the catheter with oil or grease or egg white. The patient sits on a chair.
Its loop and its inner lining are lubricated with wet sponges, oil, or damp water. Then the catheter is gently inserted into the inner lining until it reaches the root of the inner lining. Then the inner lining is bent upwards towards the perineum, then the catheter is pushed inside.
Until the inner lining is bent, then the catheters are pushed inside until they're close to the prostate gland causing the penis to tilt downwards. The catheter is then pushed further until it reaches the bladder, and the patient senses that something has reached a voided state.
It is made at this level because the path through which urine flows in it is twisted. Then, the thread is pulled with some strength by wool, as urine follows the wool, then it is removed and the urine is drained, and the catheter is repeated.
Even until the bladder is emptied and one feels light with urine.
The fortieth chapter.
How to inject the bladder with the needle.
Illustrations of the devices that are suitable for this, they are made from silver or hollow brass. They have a long tube on a bent hook and I want to irrigate them with water and medicines in an apparatus which is called a needle. This is how it looks like:.
They are made from silver or hollow brass. They have a long tube on a bend, all of it except the end which is closed with a plug. The part where you place your finger has two holes on one side and one hole on the other as you see.
The hollow part where the pump is placed, it's as wide as needed with no excess. When you draw water through it, it will suction and when you push it, it will be expelled like how a pump which is used to throw oil in sea battles works.
And if you wish to introduce the fluids into the bladder, insert one end of the needle into the fluid and draw upwards with the pump. The fluid will be sucked into the hollow part of the needle then it enters through its tip as we described in the catheters, and then press the water with the pump.
And that fluid reaches the bladder in place until one feels it, this is also a picture of a gentle syringe used to inject the bladder:.
They are made of silver or ivory; its head is higher than the rest resembling a small cap, below it there's a socket that contains a band. Then you take a goat bladder and put in it the fluid you wish to inject into the bladder then you tie it tightly between two parts with a double thread.
That moisture is slightly heated on the fire then, one end of the catheter is introduced into the bladder. Then, you tightly grip the bladder with the wetness with a tight grip until the ill person feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it. Punch holes in all parts of it and then insert a thin thread like how you would spin, and then gather the circle as you would gather a bag after putting what you want of moisture, ointments, and water inside it.
Then, tie it in the apparatus and make it as you made with the bladder from squeezing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
The sixty-first chapter.
In the extraction of stones.
We mentioned in the division types of stones and their treatment with medicine, we have pointed out the differences between the stone formed in the kidney and the stone formed in the bladder, and its signs, as well as the stone where work is done manually and cracking.
And this is the stone formed specifically in the bladder, which erupts in the bladder, and I am describing it with a clear explanation and succinctly.
I say that the stone formed in the bladder is more exposed to boys, and one of its signs is that urine comes out of the bladder resembling water in its thinness.
And in it, sand appears and men mention it, play with it, and it hangs down frequently then spreads, and the scrotum protrudes in many of them. It becomes easier for boys to be affected by this until they reach fourteen years old, and it becomes harder in the elderly. As for young adults, it is somewhere between those two.
The one whose stone is larger has an easier treatment compared to the smaller ones, for it's against this that we should perform first when treating. That would be to inject a catheter which expels all the pus within him as it might prevent finding the stone during examination.
Then the sick person's legs are taken and they are shaken downwards so that the stone may descend to the urethra, or if it is located high up, it is shifted several times down. Then he/she sits between your hands with his/her arms under his/her knees; this makes the whole bladder inclined downwards. Afterward, you search through them.
Then, you feel inside and if you feel the stone in the space, immediately proceed with scratching it. If it does not fall under a gentle touch, then it should be advisable to smear the index finger (if the patient is a child) or the middle finger of your left hand with some oil from your right hand.
If it's a fully grown boy, you insert him and search for the stone until it falls under your finger. Then you move it gradually towards the urethra, then you press on it with your finger and push it out in the direction where you want to make the incision.
You command a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and you command another servant to raise their right hand above women's hands and the other hand to extend the skin underneath the women's hands towards where the incision should be. Then you take the clamp tool that looks like this:.
You make an incision between the boy and the woman not in the middle but on the left side, making the incision near the stone and your finger is inside while you press it towards the outside so that the incision will be wider from the outside and narrower from inside as much as necessary for the stone to come out.
Do not press the finger in the stone's cavity when the crack is made, maybe it will come out easily without difficulty. Be aware that there might be parts of the stone with corners and edges making its removal difficult due to these characteristics.
Some parts are smooth like beechwood and inclined, making their removal easy. If there are parts with corners and edges, they might slightly increase the size of the crack. If they do not come out this way, it would be necessary to change tactics. Either you try gripping them firmly at one end as you would a spatula.
To stabilize the stone so it doesn't escape from his hand, or else introduce a smooth, delicately curved instrument under the stone. If you can't use it effectively, widen the crack slightly; if you have accumulated some blood, cut it with a scalpel.
If there are more than one, push the larger one into the bladder's mouth first, then make a cut on it. After that, push in the smaller one. Do this if there is more than two. If it's extremely large, you're ignorant to make a huge incision on it because it exposes two possibilities.
Either it dies, or else it will always suffer from urinary retention due to the fact that the affected area won't heal. Try pushing them until they come out, or change their position by breaking them with forceps so they can be removed piece by piece.
Once you're done with your work, cleanse the wound with a dressing and gauze. Apply pressure and traction on it, then cover it with an incision made in ointment or a mixture of oil and water to cool down any inflammation. The patient should rest head up on his pillow until at least the third day. Avoid removing stitches until that time.
If the pus discharges from the wound, bathe the area with plenty of water and oil. Then treat it with narghile ointment and basil ointments until it heals. If there is an inflammatory lump and ulcers like that, if blood congeals in the bladder and prevents urination, this can be identified by bleeding with urine.
If you enter your finger into the wound and remove this blood, if it remains, it calls for corruption in the bladder and its infection. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, applying each type of treatment that corresponds to it until it heals.
It is necessary in all stages of treatment to bind the thighs and bring them together to stabilize the drugs placed on the site. If the stone is small and has formed inside it, preventing urination from coming out, treat it with what I have described before it turns into a break.
Often, I have been able to do without this surgery because of this treatment. What you try is that you take a piece of malleable iron which would look like this:.
Like a triangular end with a sharp point in the reed, then you take a thread and tie it around the penis under the stone so that it doesn't go back to the bladder. Then you insert the malleable iron rod into the urethra gently until the malleable iron reaches the same stone.
And you move the malleable iron in your hand slightly on the stone and as you push it into its hole until it comes out from the other side, then urine starts coming out from it. Then you cover the remaining part of the stone with your hand outside the penis; it breaks off and comes out along with urine, and the operation is cured.
If this treatment is not available to you because of an obstacle that prevents you, tie a thread under the stone and another thread above it. Then cut through the stone in the middle of the stick between the two threads, then remove it.
Then, remove the bandage and clean out the clotted blood that has accumulated in the wound. It was necessary to tie a thread under the stone so as not to return to the bladder; and the other bandage above is for when after removing the stone the skin returns to its place to cover the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin up so that it returns after emptying and covers the wound as we have said.
The sixty-first chapter.
In the removal of stones for women.
Stone formation is rare in women, yet if you come across a woman with a stone, it complicates treatment due to several reasons. One reason could be that the woman might still be young, and another being that you may not find a woman willing to expose herself to a doctor.
If she is menstruating or from those who are impure, the third reason being that you cannot find a woman who practices this craft, especially manual work. And the fourth reason is that the location of the cut in stones for women differs from the location of the stone itself, so it requires a new incision.
There is a risk in this, but if necessity calls for it, you should take a well-practiced female doctor. She is rare though, so if she's unavailable, seek out an experienced menstruating woman or find someone skilled in female procedures within the craft of women's health care.
Open it and command her to perform all instructions given regarding the stone first, that is, to look whether she can fit her finger into her vaginal canal and examine the stone. If found, press it beneath her finger.
If she is not yet a woman and is thick, the surgeon should command the assistant to insert her finger into the receiver's anus and inspect the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it vigorously.
If found, it should be pushed through the mouth of the bladder to its full extent until it reaches the root of the thigh. Then, the surgery should be performed near half of the anus at the root of the thigh on either side where the touch reveals the presence of the stone in that area.
Her finger must not leave the stone, pressing it down. The cut should be small at first then introduce a tool into this little incision. If she feels the stone, she needs to increase the size of the cut according to her knowledge that the stone is about to come out, and remember that types of stones are many.
There are small and large ones, smooth, rough, long, round, spiral, and with branches. Learn their types as you will use it for guidance on what you want to do. If the blood flow is dominant, soak it in the cleansed area and hold it for a while until the bleeding stops then resume your work.
Until the stone comes out. Make sure to prepare in your mind for the devices that you mentioned about extracting stones from men, which you can use in your work. If the blood flow dominates and you understand the heartbeat of the blood to be coming from a severed artery, place the forceps on the site.
Tighten with the aids tightly and leave it, do not proceed further. Leave the stone and do not remove it; perhaps the patient might die from this treatment. Then treat the wound. If after some days the bleeding ceases, cleanse the area, return to your work until the stone is removed.
The second and sixtieth chapter.
In the cut on the water-bearing trough.
The water-bearing troughs are actually a concentration of moisture in the white lining that exists underneath the testicle skin surrounding the testicles, known as the scrotum. They can also be found within a specific membrane prepared by nature near one of the testicles.
Until he thinks it's another egg between the testicle skin and the white lining we mentioned earlier, which is not common. These water-bearing troughs are produced due to weakness that affects females, causing this substance to form, possibly from a blow towards females.
This moisture can have many colors. It may appear as yellow, it could be red like blood, or dark like rust, or water-like white. The latter is more common and can be recognized by certain signs.
When the water is present, if it's in the white membrane we mentioned, then the tumor is somewhat elongated along its length like an egg shape. The testicle isn't visible because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is within its own special membrane, then the tumor will be elongated in one direction of the egg.
And that's why people think it's another egg, as the moisture between the testicle skin and the white membrane is felt by touch. If you want to know its color, press a square probe over the tumor which was previously shown in picture form; whatever comes out of the probe indicates what's inside.
If we move to the treatment with iron, you should order the patient to have a split if it is possible for him and I see his body full then he lies on his back on something slightly elevated, there are many holes underneath him. Then you sit on his left side.
And you should order a servant to sit on his right side extending his index finger towards one of my sides, the scrotum skin and towards the area near the stomach's urinary tract. Then take an elongated spatula, cut the scrotum skin from the center lengthwise almost reaching the thigh.
The cut should be straight and parallel to the line that divides the scrotum skin into halves until it reaches the white cavity containing the appendix, then you will remove this and be careful not to cut through it. You need to dissect close to the side that sticks to the testicle more and perform your dissection as much as possible.
Then, you should gently flatten the appendix full of water widely and remove all the water. Next, divide the edges of the cut with scissors, spread the appendix upwards without touching the scrotum cavity's skin, cut the appendix as much as possible either by removing it in one piece or in sections.
Especially its softer side, if you do not remove it thoroughly, the water may re-enter. If during your operation, the egg pushes outside of its skin due to this, once you finish cutting the appendix, you should return it. Then stitch together the scrotum skin edges.
Then treat him according to other surgical procedures until he recovers. If the egg has been affected by another disease, it might be necessary to tie up the vessels in the spermatic cord fearing hemorrhage then cut off the scrotum and extract the egg, afterwards treat him accordingly as we mentioned.
If the water collected at both ends, know that these are two arteries; split the other side as you did on the first, whether it is equal to your liking for the work to be one, then do so and wipe out the blood.
And put in the incisions pieces of wool that had been soaked in oil or rose butter, and from outside place another piece of wool that had been dipped in wine and oil on both testicles and the abdominal fluids. Place above it a folded cloth which is the reinforcement. And secure it from above with this six-ended bandage as shown in this image:.
Then take two folded pieces, lace them and stuff with wool that has been treated as in this example. Create the ends that it wraps around made of cotton or wet wool which are then tied up by a waistband. One end takes hold on the backrest to the back.
The second one takes towards the elbow, and the two ends below on the thighs while the remaining two ends are on the buttocks. The entire tie is gathered in the waistband of the trousers. This girth can also be made with a cord instead of cutting with iron.
And you should take a soft, slender file, scrape the testicular skin as we described until the white cavity containing water is exposed. Take another tool as shown in this image:.
It resembles the Greek eye, then seal that opening with it until all moisture comes out. Then stretch that opening and sew it using gutta percha. File away the coating containing it as much as you can by scraping with a tool until you extract everything from the egg without touching it with fire.
And know that this procedure makes the blood flow safer and is better than cutting, if you encounter resistance in the incision or during sewing, a hot object or bleeding or anything else, treat it according to its condition as explained above whenever you come across any obstacle of that nature.
If the patient is stubborn and cannot bear this operation due to its severity, they should use a probe as described which becomes effective if it matches your findings based on the provided evidence.
The bladders are watery. It is recommended that the patient sit on a high stool, then press the lump from below using a wide clamp, and make sure the probe is along the entire body with an opening wide enough for all water to flow out. Then place cotton on the spot and tie it.
Leave him to drain the rest of the water, then treat until the wound heals. If water starts leaking out while applying pressure, it's likely because the white lining is obstructing at the mouth of the wound and preventing the water from draining.
In that case, it is necessary to enter the wound with a goat's hair or the tool used to drain water from lovers as depicted in illustrations, or slightly increase the opening of the wound.
And know that water may return and gather after about six months or thereabouts. If it gathers, reapply pressure in the same manner and let the stubborn patient endure his days.
The sixty-third chapter.
In the section on the meaty inguinal hernia and its treatment.
And know that the incision on this type of hernia leads to ruin in most cases, for this reason we avoid it and ensure its safety while considering the work involved and types of tumors.
I say that many tumors can occur within the bodies made up of female components, and this is due to various reasons. Either from impurities in menstrual blood directed towards females or as a result of blows. The color of the tumor matches the body's color and it does not contain water.
The tumor is hard, and it might be pigmented in color like a boil, having no sensation. It could result from the complication of veins and their swelling as previously mentioned or due to the swelling of the arteries. In case of arterial swelling, this can be recognized by noticing the disappearance of the tumor.
If it collapses when you pinch it and does not show any soreness, whereas the one from artery swelling doesn't disappear at all upon pinching. This type might penetrate into other tissues.
He cuts the scrotal skin, then pulls the testicle upwards and takes it out through the white membrane. He clears the ligaments from the vessels, ties up the vessels, and cuts off the ligament after making sure that none of its ends are stuck to any parts of the testicle, if the testicle was adhered to this growing flesh.
It is necessary to pull out the testicle and cut it, if there's adhesion between something of the membranes or in-between the vessels. It is recommended to clear all this kind of adhesion and cut it in a straight line.
If the growth is in a place of attachment that's behind, it should be cut off completely before removing the testicle as we mentioned. Once you've done your work, cleanse the wound with gauze soaked in oil and wine, then treat it with other medications until it heals.
The sixty-fourth chapter.
In treating stones that are within the uterus.
The dalya is a tumor that has become twisted, resembling a knot. It causes discomfort for the pregnant woman and restricts her ability to move, perform physical activities, or walk. In treating this condition, it's similar to what was previously discussed.
But we should mention the procedure as the first ones did it, I say that it is necessary to make the patient sit on a high stool then push the women's breasts downward and then hold the scrotum skin with your fingers near the penis.
The servant holds it against you for a very long time. Then, he makes an incision with a sharp, broad surgical knife until the blood vessels are exposed, then cuts them on both sides as instructed to cut veins in the flanks. Next, he pierces it with a needle that has been twisted into two threads.
She ties it at the first place where duality was offered and also at the last, then makes an incision in the middle as a vertical line across her body and removes whatever has gathered of bad moisture.
Then, treat the female using treatments for other surgeries you want to generate for a period until the blood vessels that nourish one of the females are shed; there is nothing wrong with that. If duality is offered for all the blood vessels, it should be that one of the females be removed along with the blood vessels so as not to deprive the ovary of food. By cutting off the blood vessels, it collapses and is not benefited from.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
In the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.
The occurrence of this inflammation involves making an incision that opens in the abdominal cavity extending to the navel area, from the intestinal loops. The intestinal contents then drain through that incision into one of the females.
This incision can either be from the peritoneal opening or from its extension. These two types of conditions are among many causes, such as a blow, stab, shouting, lifting something heavy and so forth. Its symptoms occur gradually over a long period if it is due to an extension of the peritoneal cavity.
Suddenly, the tumor becomes flat reaching nearly to the depth before the opening of pus squeezes out. Its indication is when it occurs from the beginning of the incision causing a severe pain and it appears differently under the skin nearby.
That happens with the expulsion of pus and its direction outside through the opening. It may come out together with pus in which case it is called a pus and thermogenic hole, it can also be accompanied by wind. Sometimes the feces go inside the pus and are trapped there leading to deterioration of digestion.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling noise, especially when squeezed. The treatment for this type of ailment with iron is risky, one should be cautious not to fall into it. A method of action is to instruct the patient to push the pus back inside his body if it tries to return.
Then he lies between your hands with his legs raised. Stretch the skin behind the scrotum upwards and cut all of the foreskin lengthwise. Then, insert canals in the slit of its length as much needed for widening it.
The slit is according to what can allow the passage of eggs, then remove the prepuces beneath the foreskin until both white and hard testicles are exposed from each side. Then insert your ring finger beneath the eggs.
Between the white testicle beneath the testis skin and the second opening, you should release the adhesion behind the testis. Then bend with your right hand inside the foreskin, at this time stretch the white testicle with your left hand above and lift the testicles together towards the slit.
Command the servant to lift the testis upwards and completely release the adhesion at its back. Use your finger to search thoroughly; there should be nothing of enclosed pus in the hard white testicle. If you find something, push it into the abdomen downwards.
Then take a needle with thick thread that has been cut into ten threads and enter it at the last incision under the skin of the scrotum behind the cut. Then cut both ends of the curved thread until there are four strands. Then some of them are assembled together in a solid manner and it is tied to the incision we said was under the scrotal skin with a very tight bandage from both sides. Then, also fold the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing could reach any part of the vessels they feed. So that no heat rash appears and it also becomes a second bandage outside the first one less than an inch away from it. After these two bands, he leaves the incision under the scrotal skin as large as the size of a finger.
So that no heat rash appears and it also becomes a second bandage outside the first one less than an inch away from it. After these two bands, he leaves the incision under the scrotal skin as large as the size of a finger. And cut the rest of it in a winding manner and remove with it the testicle, then make a slit underneath the scrotal skin that bleeds like we described earlier. Then he uses cotton soaked in oil to place on the wound, and uses the bandage as described before.
And sometimes the white incision that we mentioned after its cautious removal may bleed excessively, which often happens. Leave the bandage until it falls off on itself; if it doesn't fall off quickly enough, you can use hot water to encourage its removal.
Then treat the wound with all other treatments for wounds until it heals.
The sixty-first section.
In this condition, which I haven't seen anyone daring to treat with iron, the first thing mentioned is that it should be treated as we described for the incision associated with Daliani. That is, tie the vessels above the cut after applying it in a gentle manner underneath.
Then cut through the middle and treat the tumor by opening it until the vessels fall out, then heal the wound as we have mentioned until it heals.
Chapter seventy-six.
In the hernia that occurs in the abdomen.
Hernias in the abdomen, as we have mentioned, may occur at various locations without involving any internal organs significantly; if they do involve internal organs, this is usually minor and can be resolved in all instances.
However, if the condition persists over time, the incision in the umbilicus increases until it starts to involve internal organs and a protrusion occurs during the division of the muscles. This can happen due to the extension of the umbilical area as we have discussed. This occurs because the umbilical cord extends, then relaxes and pulls on its place causing it to protrude. The treatment involves surgery as I have described previously.
It can be treated with iron in this manner: the patient needs to lie on their back between your hands, then you should make an incision at the hot spot of the hernia running across the width of up to three fingers. You would also stretch out the skin folds beneath the skin afterwards.
Even if the white abdomen opens above it, you would take a thread and place it on the resulting area of the incision, pushing it into the depth of the belly until you stitch both resulting areas to either end of the thread from the abdominal wall, securing them with stitches one by another.
Then, pull the thread end but do not cut the abdominal wall entirely, nor touch the testicles or any other parts as I taught you in treating intestinal obstructions. Then, treat it with surgical wound care afterwards.
If the threads break, clean them and bind the wound until it disappears; thus, the stricture will tighten but not increase the hernia.
And the keystone is better in this position because it is closer to safety.
The eighty-sixth chapter.
In relaxing the skin of the scrotum.
Often, the skin of the scrotum relaxes in some people without relaxing the muscles inside it, making its appearance unpleasant. It would be advisable for those who wish to treat it to lie on their back with the penis pointing upwards.
And cut all the relaxed skin on the thick skin, then gather the lips together. If you wish, sew the first part of the relaxed skin with three or four threads and check the sewing before cutting between the stitches.
Then, treat it with other surgical treatments until it heals and the threads fall off.
The ninety-sixth chapter.
In circumcision.
Circumcision is prohibited in our religion.
And for this reason, it was incumbent upon me not to mention it in my book and yet I mentioned it for two reasons: one is that when someone asks about circumcision, doctors should know how to treat those who are affected by it. The second reason is that we often need circumcision of some animals for our needs.
Circumcision is also done on animals like camels, dogs, cats and so forth. I say that circumcision can be done in two ways: either through masturbation or by cutting and removing the foreskin. If it's done via masturbation, the method involves placing the animal in hot water until its penis relaxes, becomes soft and hangs down.
Then rub it with your hand until it dissolves and is not identifiable upon touch, and as for castration through cutting and severing, it should be that you hold the animal and press its testicles with your left hand then tie the threads and cut each testicle in one cut.
Even if the two testicles protrude, cut them after skinning them and do not leave anything of the scrotum except for the delicate one that is on the vessels. This form of castration is better than that which involves rubbing.
Because rubbing might leave something of the females, and the animal desires intercourse, then treat the wound until it heals.
The seventy-seventh chapter.
In treating feminization.
Feminization in men occurs in two ways: one where it appears in the space or in the skin between the female's genitals, resembling a woman's vagina with hair, and urine may leak from it; this is within the testicle skin.
As for women, there is one type that appears above the vagina on the thigh, like little penises reaching out of both to resemble a man's penis; and the two others are like females. The treatment for these three types.
The two types of men and the one type of women that needs excess flesh cut off until its effects are relieved, then treat it with regular surgery until healing occurs. As for the second type of men that urinates, there is no function or appearance like in females.
The eighty-seventh chapter.
In cutting the penis and flesh derived from women's vulvas.
The penis might increase beyond the natural order, becoming swollen and discolored, perhaps even spreading among some women to resemble men, causing them to engage in sexual intercourse.
You should hold the advantage of the penis in your hand or with a clamp and cut it, but do not linger on the cutting nor especially at the base for fear of causing bleeding.
Then, treat it with surgical wound care until it heals. As for the regenerated flesh, it is flesh that grows in the womb's mouth to fill it.
It might also protrude outside like the tail. Therefore, some early scholars call this disease the tail sickness, and it should be cut off as one cuts off the penis, treating it until it heals.
The second chapter and the seventy-fourth section.
In treating scrofula.
Scrofula refers to when a woman's vagina is not fully inserted or the opening is small. It can either be naturally present at birth, or it could be due to some underlying condition that has progressed. The latter is from excess flesh growing out of its natural limit.
Or, it could be thin or thick, being either in the depth of womb, in its sides, above or below, preventing intercourse, coagulation, and childbirth; maybe even menstruation. Recognition of this comes from the midwife's observation.
If the obstruction is visible nearby, and if it's not visible, she should feel it with her fingers or a stick; if the obstruction is thin like a membrane and close to the lips of the vagina, prompt in its piercing. This involves placing something on the lips that resembles straws and then using all fingers of both hands together.
The woman is on her back, with her legs spread. Then the two incisions are made strongly until they puncture the thin membrane and open the obstruction. Afterwards, she takes wool which she moistens in oil and places it at the spot. The woman reunites every day so as not to allow the spot to heal again.
If the stricture is thick and tough, it may be necessary to cut it with a broad scalpel resembling a paper knife. If the obstruction is made of fresh meat, it should be tied with sutures and cut. Have on hand medications for stopping bleeding without causing pain such as cacao, ginger, curd mixed with egg whites.
Then she uses a large copper tube to prevent the wound from healing quickly, holding it for days. She then uses dry cotton fiber and treats with other treatments for scar formation until it heals. There may be another meat plant that might occur in the womb and may need to be cut in this manner.
If it is not cancerous, then the cancerous tumor in the womb should not be treated with iron.
The 37th chapter.
In treating hemorrhoids, fistulas and red blisters that appear on women's thighs.
As for hemorrhoids, it is an inflammation of the veins so that much blood flows continuously from them. If hemorrhoids occur, they become fistulas. I have mentioned in the previous section their types and symptoms. We will summarize these here.
What can be treated and what cannot, I would say that hemorrhoids and fistulas, if they are deep in the womb and not perceptible by touch, do not have treatment with iron. The ones that appear in contact with the womb's mouth are those that require treatment.
In order for a woman to enter a cold house, then wet the blankets with coarse material or by a sharp wood splinter, cut them from their roots, and leave them when bleeding from one of the obstructions causing blood flow without teasing.
Like rubbing with oil, herbs, milk and so on. Then raise her legs to the wall for an hour and then hang them in cold water. If bleeding lasts, make her sit in a bath of coriander seeds, peelings of pomegranate and cinnamon and similar items. Take the flour of wheat grains, knead it with honey and mix.
Padded him on his back, if the bleeding stopped, otherwise, adhere to the treated bar and the breasts without any condition. Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tarthith or the juice of pregnant cow tongue or the juice of branches of allig (a kind of plant) with cinnamon drink and adhere to the position.
If the tumor settles, treat the site with the ointment until it heals. As for the red pus, it resembles the heads of haws (a kind of fruit) in appearance; it is necessary to cut what has appeared from it according to what was mentioned in the blankets, and then heal it until it heals.
The forty-seventh chapter.
In the condition of womb exposure during menopause.
Many types of tumors may appear in the womb, such as cancer, calcified tumor, ulcers, pus-filled abscesses, eating disorders, nails, hemorrhoids, fissures, blankets, and hot tumors. All these diseases and their types along with their signs have been mentioned in this section.
In this article, we should mention the hot tumor that appears in the womb when it is one of the tumors that accumulate for a period. How its soreness is with iron. You should look if there is sharp pain at the beginning of the tumor along with swelling and fever.
I saw that if he feels a sensation, do not hurry with the treatment and heal him according to what helps the process of maturation until these symptoms settle. Then it should be recommended for the woman to sit on a chair with two seats and lean against its back.
And she should gather her legs towards the lower abdomen, with her thighs spread apart. Her arms should be under her knees and they should be tied together with a belt that is suitable.
Therefore, the gynecologist should sit on the right side and use the device with which she opens the womb's mouth that will later form its image. It is necessary when you want to use this device to estimate the depth of the woman's womb so that the one entering from the device does not exceed the depth of the womb.
It can harm the expectant mother if the device is deeper than the womb. It is necessary to place sponges on the lips of the cervix mouth to prevent the whole device from entering the depth of the womb. The tube that runs in the device should be from the top side.
And you hold the device, while the servant moves the tube until it opens the cervix. If the discharge appears and can be touched with a soft texture, then you should cut it near its head with a wide scissor, allowing all the contents to drain out completely.
It is necessary to have a soft wick dipped in rose oil or green oil containing some grip, and the wick should be outside the cut in the cervix. From outside, clean wool soaked in boiling water mixed with bread dough should be used on the womb and the thigh.
Then, treat with the ointment suitable for that until it heals, after two days.
And the womb and the wound may be washed with a injection of water and honey, then in water that has boiled with the root of myrrh or a long wormwood. Then it returns to the restorative ointment, if the discharge is hidden inside the womb.
And you should refrain from treating it with iron but use what we mentioned in the section.
The seventy-fifth chapter.
In teaching the removal of foreign bodies, how they should be treated if they come out not in their natural form.
The midwife should first know the natural birth. Its signs include when you see a woman becoming pale, wanting to breathe downwards and getting annoyed by what she is experiencing during labor.
And it speeds up the baby's birth; know that this kind of birth is natural, with its head and placenta exiting or suspended by its cord. If you notice these signs, it would be advisable to massage her belly so the baby can come out quickly.
If it descends onto his head, the placenta comes with him and cleans off that discharge properly. Other than this birth, it is not natural and reprehensible because he may come out on his feet, or have his hands before his head and feet.
And one hand or foot comes out, or his head and hand come out, or he emerges curled up, perhaps even lying on its back, in all these reprehensible forms. The midwife should be vigilant about these things and beware of errors and mistakes.
And I explain every form of it and how to handle each, so you can refer to this when facing them. If the baby comes out on its head, which is natural birth, and the woman feels intense pressure and strain, and notices that her strength has weakened, then have her sit in a chair with women helping her stabilize.
To lengthen the uterus by means of cooked plums and moist dainties, then enters the midwife between her fingers with a small sharp tool to break up or cut the membranes until what is within them of moisture flows out, and then squeezes the woman's abdomen until the baby descends.
If the baby doesn't descend, it is necessary to inject the woman with the juice of plums mixed with oil of the anus. Then she should be instructed to blow and wipe her nose with a handkerchief while pinching her mouth and nose. The baby will come out from its confinement. If the first hand of the baby comes down, it should be gently pushed back in slowly.
If she doesn't come in, place the woman on a stool and raise her legs above. Then shake the stool on the ground while the woman holds onto it so she doesn't fall when shaken. If the hands don't enter and the baby dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the baby.
Or tie his hands with a thong and pull them evenly; he will come out, the baby's birth on its feet. If the baby comes down on its feet, you should push them up first then rotate the baby slowly until it is straightened out, then take one of its legs and extend it gradually.
If they've come down to the thighs, instruct her to blow and wipe her nose with a handkerchief; he will come out. If it does not come out as described or otherwise, gently rotate the baby until it is in its natural position; then it will come out smoothly if none of our prescribed methods work completely.
Take the saliva of the cicada, the juice from plums and oil of the anus, along with a strong-smelling substance dissolved in it. Beat all these together well inside her womb, then use this mixture to wash her vagina and lower abdomen. Then, have her sit in warm water until the fumes reach her.
If you notice that it has become detached from the bottom, create a support for her to carry it. If she holds this support for an hour, then place her on the chair. Then clean and cover her mouth and nose, gently squeeze below her belly. The fetus will come out of its sack, with the fetus coming out on its knees and hands.
If it comes out in this manner, allow her hands to enter a little bit at a time. Then the woman should lay on her side and hang down her legs towards the bottom. She should be lying on the bed with her hands folded, then gently squeeze above her belly from time to time. Then remove whatever is under her feet from the pillows so that she is positioned downwards. If the fetus does not come out, take both of her legs and move them sharply. Then gently squeeze above her thighs until the fetus ascends above. Then the midwife will enter her hand and adjust the fetus gradually.
Instruct the woman to stay in this position until the fetus comes out. The birth occurs with the fetus being obstructed, one of its hands is raised. She should hold her hand back if she can't manage it herself. If she cannot walk, make her stand up. If she cannot walk, have her lie down on...
Have her lie on the bed and shake her legs violently. Then use the suction tool that was described from saliva extraction methods. If it successfully applies suction, have her sit on a chair, then instruct her to hold her hand back and adjust the baby into its natural position. Have the woman clean herself and ensure she stays in this position until the birth completes.
The birth of the fetus should occur with its head flat on its back, and its hands outstretched. The midwife should then grab one of the baby's arms and slowly turn it while gently adjusting it. Once it is properly aligned, she should carry it using the oil and salve as described above.
Then when she slightly moves, if she does so, then I have her sit on the chair and order her to lean to the right side. Then let her twist and floss clean herself as this causes the baby to come out standing at one side.
If it descends into the womb in this state with the placenta, cut the placenta with your nail until all moisture is drained. If it clings to the baby's face or neck, cut it from the back to prevent choking and death. Then push the baby inward until it is in the correct position.
Instruct the woman to clean herself several times as this will make it easier for twins or multiple fetuses to be born. Know that multiple births happen frequently and some may have three, four, etc., but they often live only if it's rare cases. As for five children, that is outside of nature and they cannot survive at all.
They surround them, even if they are many, with one placenta, and they separate by a barrier in the middle of each one, which is attached to their back. They might come out as any single baby would naturally and easily, or they might come out in a disgraceful way, as we described.
If some of them are difficult during birth and become like the shapes we described as unnatural, treat them as we described, let the pregnant woman be gentle and do what she does with care and caution, adapting herself to each shape according to the trick that is prepared for her leading to safety.
Describe what is imagined in the womb of fetuses, some may imagine one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or even more than ten. I have heard that a woman gave birth to seven and another to fifteen, all imagining this.
In consideration of the esteemed all-knowing, this is all that should exist in the science of gynecology for perhaps it may be presented to her someday so she can respond with what should be.
The sixty-seventh chapter.
In the expulsion of the dead fetus.
If you treated the dead fetus with the treatment mentioned in each section, and it did not come out, forcing your hand to work, then you should look. If she is strong and has no symptoms that worry her about damage, then the woman should lie on a bed on her back.
And her head should be inclined downwards, and her legs raised, with a servant adjusting her from both sides or tying her to the bed in case her body gets sucked when the baby is being pulled.
Then, the womb is moistened with wet cloths and saliva of the camel and honeycomb, as well as wool grease. The surgeon then applies these substances to her hands and enters them into the womb gently. She looks for a place where she can insert the instruments of delivery from the baby, or in places that match this requirement.
Look, if the fetus is head-down, insert the delivery instruments into his eyes or nose, mouth, nipples, under his beard, or in other nearby places like near the spine or below the hips.
And if the fetus is descending on his legs, it would be in the knee area and the middle back. It should be noted that you should hold the instrument with your right hand and keep its handle between your left fingers; then insert your hand gently while inserting the delivery instrument into one of those mentioned places.
Until you reach a hollow thing, then pierce it with another or third chisel if needed to make the pull equal and not inclined towards any side. Then extend for an even length, not letting the extension be merely straight but moving it in every direction.
It makes it easier to come out as when pulling teeth. It should be that there is relaxation in the pull, if it is held towards one side then it may be greased with some grease on some fingers and introduced from that side to move what is held. If part of the fetus has come out, you can move the chisels to other positions.
You raise this slightly until the entire fetus comes out. If a hand came out before the other and cannot be pushed back due to being pressed, it may be that you tie it with a rope then pull it until all of it has come out and cut it.
Either in the elbow joint or in the shoulder blade. Thus, it should be done in the other hand and legs as well. If the fetus' head is large and wide, causing pressure during birth or if there's accumulated water inside its head, you may insert a curved spatula between the fingers.
She cuts with it the head so that the water comes out, or she uses a device called the 'shadax' to squeeze (the water) out. This is accompanied by images of other devices in the section that follows this one.
Likewise, if the fetus has a large head naturally, you may cut the skull or apply the shadax (device) as we mentioned then remove the bones with forceps. If the head comes out and gets compressed during straining, cut until the moisture inside the chest drains out.
Then the chest joins, if it doesn't join and there's no room for birth, cut where you can. If it's at the bottom of the belly, push or if there's milk in it, it should be that moisture drains out from it.
If the fetus is on its legs, drawing it out is easy and settling it into the womb mouth is there. If it is squeezed at the belly or chest, then it should be drawn out with a thrust that you have wrapped in your hand and cut through the belly or chest until what is inside comes out.
If you have extracted all the organs and pulled back the head, then it has stopped. If you enter with your left hand, if the mouth of the womb is open, you should put your hand into the neck of the womb and hold the head with it, then pull it in with your fingers to the mouth of the womb. Then, you should insert a rod or two rods and pull it in with them.
If the mouth of the womb has fused with a hot tumor and is wide, then it should not be forcefully applied to. Rather, in that case, the use of wet and oily substances is recommended. Glandular fluids are utilized, and one sits in water that calms and moistens.
And if the fetus is on its side, and it can be flattened, then what we have mentioned in regards to live fetuses should be used. If that cannot be done, then cut it off completely and remove it. It should not leave any part of the placenta inside entirely. After finishing your treatment, use the remedies for hot tumors as described when they appear within the womb.
If there is a blood flow, you should submerge in the gathered water and use all other treatments. I have seen a woman who was pregnant, her fetus died within her womb, then she became pregnant again.
Then, the other fetus also died. It took a long time for this to happen; it produced a tumor in her abdomen which inflamed until it opened and started discharging pus. I was called to treat her over a long period of time but the wound did not heal. So, I applied some very strong antiseptic ointments on it.
He removed a bone from the wound, then days passed and another bone was removed. She was amazed at this, as the abdomen is an area without bones. She concluded that it was fragments of the dead fetus's skull. She searched the incision and extracted numerous bones similar to those in the fetal skull.
I continued to follow this until I extracted a large number of bones. The woman was in the best condition possible and had indeed lived like this for some time from this wound, there is a persistent discharge coming from it. This is why I have come here with such rarity.
For it contains knowledge and assistance for what the doctor tries to achieve with his treatment手段.
The seventy-seventh chapter.
There are images of the machines needed for the delivery of the baby.
A picture of a stirrup used to open the womb's mouth:.
This binding material that balances the books; whether it has stirrups on both ends of the wood. However, this stirrup should be softer than the binding material and either made of birch or from the wood of the boxwood. The width of each piece of wood should be as thick as an inch.
And bend them towards a finger, their length is about a span and a half. In the middle of the pieces of wood are two tacks made from the same type of wood that are attached to them, making their length approximately half a span or slightly more. And their width is toward a finger or slightly more than this. These two tacks are essential for stability.
These two that enter the womb's mouth to open the stirrups when you guide them, is a picture of another machine for something similar but softer and lighter:.
It is made from birch wood or boxwood in the shape of paddles, but it has two tacks at its end as you can see. The length of each tack is about a span and their width is a finger. If you want to open the womb with it.
Place the woman on a bed with her legs splayed between her thighs, then insert these two rods into both ends of the womb while you are holding one end of the device under her buttocks. Then open your hand with the device as you would with pliers, according to how much opening of the womb you desire. Until she makes what she wants, an illustration of another type of reed that was mentioned by the pioneers:.
Illustration of the device used to push the baby out:.
Illustration of the tool used to suction the baby's head:.
It resembles the scissors which have teeth at the tip as you can see, and it may be made rectangular like pliers on this picture, having sawteeth similar to those of a saw that cuts and smooths.
Illustration of a pusher (device) also:.
Illustration of an incision tool:.
This incision tool has a slight thickness to prevent it from breaking when pulling the baby with it, illustration of a two-bladed incision tool:.
Illustration of wide forceps for cutting the baby:.
All of these tools, the more varied they are and the better prepared they are for use by the craftsman, make him work faster and appear capable to others. There is no tool that should be absent from what he has prepared; it is inevitable that there will be a need for it.
Chapter 87.
In the expulsion of the placenta.
If the placenta remains after childbirth, you should ask the mother to hold herself and then make her cough with a spoon and grip her mouth and chin. If it comes out like this, otherwise take some force.
Prick the cover with a hole and place inside it the opened herbs for the womb mouth like opium, belladonna, poppy, hyacinth, cumin, basil and mint. All these medicines or some of them are placed in water then put on fire. Then place a golden tube over this hole at the lid's cover and the other end into the womb mouth.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then cough as we said; the placenta will come out quickly. If it has not come out after this treatment and remains, the midwife is ordered to dip her left hand in ointment or saliva from a snake.
Then she enters her hand inside and searches for the placenta, if it touches her, she holds onto it and gently extends her hand several times until it comes out. If it is adhered deep in the womb, then she puts her hand as described until she finds the placenta, then draws it slightly towards the cervix.
In order not to remove the womb during strong suction, it is necessary to gently move it towards the right and left sides. Then increase the amount of suction; she will respond at that time and get rid of adhesion. If the opening of the womb is united, we have described treatment by coughing and treating with the pot lid and herbs.
If it does not come out with everything we described, then force the situation by repeating suction but it is necessary to attach what came out from it to the woman's thigh and then bathe her in the quadruple ointment; she will be cleaned after a few days.
She dissolves and comes out, except that when she is cleaned, it emits a bad smell to the stomach and head, which harms the patient, so incense should be used.
Therefore, some pioneers have tried a mixture of the printer's soot and dried figs, an image of the machine that the woman uses when there is retention of urine or mucus and similar conditions.
It is made from lead and resembles a clamp, or it is made from copper where the fine tip is placed in front and the wider part on the fire. The incense is made to hold onto this until that incense burns off and then she repeats the process.
The seventy-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of the female urine retention that is not due to pregnancy.
Many male infants may be born with non-pregnancy-related urine retention, where a fine membrane might have blocked it. It would be advisable for the mother to puncture that membrane with her finger; otherwise, she should use a sharp prong and beware not to touch the muscle tissues.
Then she places it on a cotton that has been soaked in alcohol and oil. Then, she treats it with ointments until he gets better. If you are afraid it might get blocked again, place a lead tube into the hole for many days; remove it when the child wants to defecate.
Urine retention might also be caused by the closure of a wound or tumor. It should then be incised, and treated with the mentioned treatment methods using lead dust and similar substances.
The eighty-first chapter.
In treating the boils that occur at the bottom.
Boils that occur at the bottom are a knot or thickening that occurs near the anus from inside or in one of the spaces on one side. The boil(s) can be singular or multiple.
If this knot opens, a watery white or soft pus stream will flow from it. This moisture may originate from the boils that have penetrated into the perianal glands and intestines, while those not penetrating may be recognized by what comes out of them when defecating or passing gas after using the toilet.
Perhaps worms may come out from it, and there may be stones if they are deeply inserted into the bladder and the passage of urine, and possibly they can be inserted to the knee joint and to the tip of the tail. And what is known as the deeply inserted stone up to the seat of expulsion also exists without being so deep inserted.
To insert your index finger into the anus and to put a delicate probe made of copper or iron in the stone, if there is no surface on it. If there is an elevated surface then insert a very thin lead probe or a hair from horse's mane inside the stone.
Even if you feel the probe or hair in your finger, if you do not feel it at all and nothing emerges from the opening except for feces, gas or worms as we said, know that it is not deeply inserted. Proceed with treatment immediately.
If the stone is inserted up to the bladder or the urinary passage, its indicator is the urine coming out from it and its inability to heal with medications. However, if it's inserted up to the knee joint or the tip of the tail, that can be determined by reaching the probe there.
If there is no ridge to the bone and pain occurs near that area with constant pus discharge from it, and no cure exists for its treatment or healing does not occur after medicine usage. All these deeply inserted stones do not allow complete recovery at all.
Treating such conditions can be a futile effort for those who are deceived by uneducated doctors. For stones that are not deeply inserted and do not have chronic issues, I hope they achieve complete recovery with iron treatment as described, which involves having the patient lie on their back between your hands.
He lifts his legs upwards and leans one of his thighs towards his belly, then a copper or lead probe is inserted into the stone if there's a surface on it, until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels this near the anus area, you should insert your index finger into the anus to proceed with treatment.
If you feel that the inserted instrument has penetrated to its full length without your noticing any ridge or muscle between your finger and it, then be sure that it is deeply embedded. Do not try to withdraw it as there is no relief from it as we said.
And they said that it may get relieved in some individuals rarely, and from treatments hoping for benefit, to heat a thin needle according to the size of the nail as mentioned before, and insert the guard into the nail until it reaches near the base. Then she should reinsert it two or three times.
Until you learn that all those excess and shriveled tissues resembling feathers of a bird have been burnt, then treat it with the application of a wadded thread dipped in oil until these burned tissues come out. Then apply salve ointment for healing, if it has been relieved.
Otherwise, it will never be relieved by any other treatment. As for when the inserted instrument was introduced but did not penetrate to your toe in the sandal, there was a thick barrier of flesh or pleat between the instrument and you, and you saw the nail beneath the skin surface afterward; then cut the skin from the first nail. And you go through the cut with the inserted instrument, which is in the nail, until you reach the end of the cut where the tip of the instrument has been, then the instrument gets removed and falls out. Then cleanse those shriveled tissues resembling bird's feather tube, leaving none behind.
Then treat it with salve ointments until it heals. If bleeding overcomes you, hindering your ability to cut off those tissues, the best action you can take and the fastest benefit is to burn it with fire or a strong medication since burning with fire combines two benefits: it burns those excess tissues.
Cutting off the blood flow and drying up moisture, then treat with ointment applied to fat or powdered sulfur in oil until it discharges pus. Then heal the wound with the healing herbs that are prepared for hard meat, allowing those burned meats to be expelled through pus. Afterward, treat the injury with salves made from plant-based remedies for hardened flesh.
These are the medicines where there is grip and evaporation. If it gets stronger, it will be healed and will not recur, unless the niter has reached the depth of the cavity and beyond the surface of the body. In that case, insert your finger into the cavity and search inside with it.
If you feel the spear and there is a barrier of skin or flesh between you and it, which is close to penetration, then working in that situation is only on the path of desire and hope. This means using one of three methods: either sealing it as we have explained.
Alternatively, you might cut until it reaches the bottom of the cavity to enable penetration and treatment close by without overdoing the cut so as not to sever the surrounding tissue, causing unintentional bowel movement. Then treat it with what we have mentioned; maybe it heals as explained.
Alternatively, you might penetrate this barrier and drill through it after cutting until near the cavity as we have explained, either with a spear or another sharp tool. Then remove all those liquefied meats within the cut to where you can reach with your investigation.
Then remove all the stitches, including the cut and upper mouth, until it is sealed. The niter will remain open inside the cavity making it easier on those defecating, and the niter may become accustomed to this state.
And if you insert the spear into the niter and it is on one side of the cavity near the body surface with skin, take a mangled-tipped spear like an echinococcus needle at this form:
Insert a twisted thread of five threads or approximately that amount, then insert the scalpel with the thread inside the suture until it reaches the bottom. If it is sucked in from the margin of the situla from inside near.
Then remove the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the seat and pull out one end of the thread. Gather both ends together, tighten them, and leave it for a day or two. Each time the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it tightly until those tissues between the ends of the threads are cut and fall off. Then treat the wound until it heals and gets rid of.
If the mouth of the suture is not sucked in, force it as much as you can, although there may be a lot at depth. You cannot do this for the muscle in order not to cut it. Then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.
The spinal clamp image that penetrates the sutures has a very sharp edge on it to remove, while the other end is not sharp in order not to cut what does not need it as you see.
The fortieth and eighty-first chapter.
In the strangulated hemorrhoids that bleed and in their cutting and treating fissures.
The hemorrhoids are of two kinds, either they are inside the anus resembling cloaks of goats or like grapes and there are small ones and large ones from which blood always flows.
They can be one or many, and they can be outside the anus especially those that are inside the anus have a lesser moisture, with water flowing out from them being yellowish or slightly bloody continuously, and they would have the color of the body.
Treating the one inside the bed, you should command him to urinate and defecate until the bed appears and the excrements become visible to you. You then quickly tie them up with reeds or hold them with your finger tips, then cut them at their roots; if the reeds do not stick due to moisture and relaxation.
Cut it with a coarse knife or part of a sharpened reed, or pull it off with your fingers, then cut it. After cutting, scrape some sharp pieces on it so that it can serve its purpose like a needle or pierce it as described in the section about needles.
Then treat it with all kinds of treatment until it recovers. If the bed does not allow you to leave, puncture the patient with a slight venom injection and wash what is in the bed with it; he will quickly be able to leave when he begins to defecate. As for those excrements coming out of the bed, command them gently.
It is to take it with your finger or hang it by a hook and cut it, then treat it as we have mentioned until recovery. And if one resists cutting with iron, it would be better to use its hair in this manner; you should take twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then attract the worms upwards and drive them out with a needle from its origin on the other side. Wrap both ends of the string below the needle when it is blocking, pull the worm tightly, then tie the string. Remove the needle after that. You do this with all the worms, leaving one unthreaded.
Let the blood drain from it, then place on the bed a knife soaked in grease or resin and put it on the bed. Command the patient to stay still, then leave him until the worms drop out. If they drop out, treat them with ointments and all forms of treatment until recovery.
If it comes to treating dryness, it is frequently exposed through the hardness of feces and the blocking of the impression. If there's no improvement in it, medication doesn't help either; it seems that shaving it with the surgeon's tool or your nail until it becomes moist might remove the upper layer of skin which prevents its union.
Then treat it until it disappears as needed, if it doesn't disappear then repeat with stronger shaving than the first one till it heals properly. Afterwards treat it, for he will recover.
The Second and Eighty Chapter.
In the treatment of inverted needles, both those that are not inverted, dry sores and ant bites.
A thorn, in fact, is merely a coiled knot with the color of the body that resembles the head of a thorn located throughout the body and especially in the heels and toes. It causes pain upon walking.
It is necessary to cut around the thorn, hold it with a file or a chisel and pull it out from its root. Then treat it; if you wish, strengthen it as described in the chapter about it. As for dry blisters, each one of them is a small, coarse knot twisted and coiled above the body surface.
Often, it appears in the hands of boys. Its treatment involves stretching the thread and cutting or twisting it with a silk thread or a hair strand until it falls off; you can strengthen it as described before with fire or with strong medicine.
Dry blisters, whether inverted or not, can be removed using the tool I mentioned in treating ant bites. As for ants themselves, they are also small, twisted, thick knots on the surface of the body that go quite deep into it; if they come into contact with cold, you might feel them like a stung by an ant.
In the entire body, there is more in the hands and its cure involves taking a tube from an owl's or a strong eagle's feather. This tube surrounds the ant until it encircles all sides of the tube. Then you manipulate your hand with the tube cutting around the ant.
And place it in the depth of the flesh, causing the ant to detach from its roots. If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube like this:.
The upper part of the tube reaches the groove, it is twisted and tight, making it easy for fingers to adjust and manipulate. If you wish, tie the ant as described in section on tying in the book about tying, .
The thirty-eighth chapter.
In illustrations of the machines used for injection in conditions related to constipation, diarrhea, and vomiting.
The syringe can be made of silver, porcelain, copper or hammered and beaten metal. The size of the apparatus ranges from small to large according to its users. The syringe used for treating younger children is smaller, and those with narrow or constricted seats have very gentle syringes. Illustration of a large syringe:.
The upper part which holds the nozzle is wide, and it has a barrier where the nozzle is attached as you can see. The lower end that enters into the seat area is extremely smooth down to the groove with two holes on one side of it, and there's one hole on the other side.
The size of the hole is appropriate for the thickness of the paste or slightly thinner. The nozzle in which you place medicine from an animal's bladder or from a sheep's fleece, made in the shape of a small spoon, has a diameter of about a finger-width.
It creates many holes as it rotates, with a hard finger space between each hole. Then, it enters in each hole a thin thread of yarn from ten threads or close to that number. It gathers the stitches like a journey. If medicine is placed inside, tension is applied on the needle's head between the stones with a tight and narrow pull, then it is injected. This is an image of the stitch-circle and hole.
And the method of administering it involves filling a container or bladder with medicine while it is warmed to the maximum possible heat. Be cautious not to make it too hot or too cold, then the patient lies on his back and raises his legs upwards.
And he places under him a cushion or an ointment cloth, then he greases the needle's tip with grease or the white of the egg or saliva from the snail or similar substances. Then, it is gently inserted into the container. The attendant gathers the stitch in his hands and squeezes it intensely until all contents inside the needle are discharged into the intestine.
And the needle is removed, and he raises his legs towards the wall. If the medicine prompts him to pass stool, he will release whatever he can. Even if he sleeps through the night, it achieves more in healing. If it's used for patients with diarrhea and if its discharge was hastened, then perform the process until he recovers.
If there are painful passageways or swellings in the container, let the needle be very soft and smooth compared to needles used for children's injections. This is an image of a gentle needle with its skin attached:.
The forty-eighth chapter.
In the treatment of wounds.
I have mentioned in the section regarding treatment of what resembles tumors and here I am detailing their cure through hands and medicines up to perfection, thus saying that surgical operations vary according to the thing upon which surgery is performed and according to the location of the wound.
The things in which surgeries take place are numerous, like a stone wound, a cut from a sword or a knife, a spear thrust, or something akin to that among many other things.
As for surgeries according to body locations, like the wound on the head or neck, chest or abdomen, or parts of organs such as the liver and so forth.
And I am describing the treatment of some surgeries to serve as a standard and law for other surgeries. I start with simple head surgeries, especially since their details will be mentioned in the initial sections of this book's third chapter.
I say that if a simple head wound occurred without fracturing the bone, and it was caused by a stone or something similar where only the skin had been penetrated and the wound was large making me concerned for heat-induced tumor formation in the patient, I would immediately intervene with a cold compress on the affected area. Do not delay this and remove some of the blood based on its strength if it doesn't prevent bleeding. Especially if only a little blood is coming out from the wound, ensure to stop the bleeding by applying pressure in opposition to the injured side.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinking and heavy foods. If something that stops bleeding is used, reduce his food intake and avoid meat or drinks. If a heat-induced tumor occurs at the wound, apply cotton dipped in rose oil only or combined with water mixed drink for soothing it.
And if the hot tumor purges, apply it to the wound while it's soft with its own blood and not changed by the air. I will describe to you shortly a substance that is effective in such situations, but if the air has already changed the tumor then apply some ointments on it.
Until the pus discharges and it is treated until healing occurs, if the wound is large and was caused by a sword or something similar, and the edges do not meet due to stitches, then sew them together with what I describe to you in suture for abdominal surgery.
If the skin reveals bone and adheres but is only sticking due to a temporary connection, cut it then treat the wound with medicines that harden and replace skin tissue. Instruct the patient to consume foods that are firm like heads, horns, and similar items so as to aid in recovery.
If there is pus in the skin that does not stick to the bone, cut off all of the affected area and burn it, then treat. If in these surgeries a blood vessel or sweat gland bleeds from them without stopping with medicine, search for inside the blood vessel.
If it doesn't heal, scrape it with a scalpel and tie it. If necessity demands it and what we mentioned is not effective, bleed until the blood stops. If these surgeries are small and simple, they can be managed easily with their own healing ability by allowing them to heal in this way with this method using their own blood.
Before it is altered by the air, the description of the drug (from milk takes one part and from myrrh two parts, and from extinguished or unextinguished fat three parts. All are ground, sifted and spread over the wound with firm pressure until it sticks properly.
The blood is allowed to coagulate first, then it is tightened from above by the ligatures and left undisturbed until it does not swell. The medicine will not leave him until he recovers, and it may do this through the castor oil alone if butter and saffron are not available.
This action can also be performed with two clamps in many major surgeries if it is done correctly and tightened, and the surgeries are moistened by their blood as long as they have not been altered by air. However, if some alteration has occurred due to air, especially during summer.
There is no practical meaning to applying these ointments or using a paste made from cooked ingredients or water and honey, even until pus forms. Then it should be treated with other remedies until recovery occurs.
If, however, a fracture occurs within the wound and it is slight, it can be pulled together with the gout. I have mentioned treatment for head fractures as they are completed in neck surgery; if the injury occurred in the neck, there would not be much difference in treatment between head injuries that were minor.
And if an artery or a vein in the neck has been severed, there is no trick other than to avoid treating it with very tight gripping substances such as forceps and tweezers etc., because they can harm the nerve and irritate it.
No cold substance should be placed on the wound because the essence of nerves is cold and their connection to the brain, which is the most refined organ, may be harmed. Treatments with gentle medicines such as the soap washed with pure water, or oiled by oil from roses and pomegranate leaves should be used several times.
If it is also washed with pure water and other metallic stones in this manner and wet applications, then if the wound is large use suturing or bring together its lips using the bandages. Then treat until he heals.
If the wound has depth and a hidden source at its bottom, which is accumulated with pus, rinse it in the lowest place available. If a vessel was severed in the wound and his blood is flowing out, stop it or tie it, or if necessity demands, puncture it.
If the wound has cut some parts of the eyelid or all of it and the eyebrow fell, bring together the skin's lips by suturing on the socket bone of the eye, do not touch the eyeball but keep its surroundings clean. Restore it to its natural shape then pull tightly without stretching and leave it for days.
Then treat it with compresses that have absorption and drying properties until it heals. If the wound affected the bone, scrape it off. If there are fragments of bone in it, remove them all or as much as possible; if it cannot be removed leave it until the wound clears up and heals so that its extraction becomes easier.
If the wound is tender, apply the charcoal that we described. If bones are revealed in the wound and it becomes hard and yellowed, treat it with what should be done according to its description in the chapter on chest surgery and between the shoulders.
If it is a thrust from a spear or a knife and you see depth in it, look; if the wind came out when you breathed into it, know that it's a fatal wound. If there is no depth to it and it is tender with blood within, do not apply charcoal or tighten the area at once for fear that blood might be trapped in its depth.
Invoke for the heart, it will kill the sick but make it attractive in two measures and leave its water during the day twice. If the medicine doesn't bother you, put a small cotton ball in the wound to suck out what comes out of moisture and have the sick person sleep on the wound.
Do not worry about what gathers there, and even if three or more days have passed since the injury with no signs of sickness in the patient, no severe tremors, nor tightness of breath, and you see that his other conditions are fine. Then understand that the wound is healthy; treat it with sutures and all other treatments until he recovers.
If seeing and stretching the scrotum continuously is impossible, know that he has become barren. Treat it from its root. The sick person who lies on the wound doesn't allow what gathers there to accumulate. If more than the chest or back has been injured, treat it with the advancements in stitching procedures.
If it is large or, if not, if it is small, if it has affected the bone and cut pieces off from it, then search for the wound and take action to remove those fragments immediately if they are clean. If they aren't clean, leave them alone until further notice.
Clean the wound as it helps in removing debris, and for all other injuries occurring in different organs, their treatment is determined similarly to what we have mentioned.
The Eighty-first Chapter.
In abdominal surgeries, the removal of internal contents and their stitching.
A breach that exposes the abdomen can be large, small, or in between. A larger one might come with feces or several intestines making its reinsertion and stitching much more challenging.
The small puncture also makes it harder from another perspective, necessitating that its reinsertion is more difficult and demanding. If one does not quickly introduce it to its place in its right time, it inflates and becomes hard; thus making the introduction of it even harder. This is why medium-sized punctures have become preferable for the small ones because they do not make the reinsertion of the pus as hard as these two types.
Know that sewing the abdomen involves four types of stitches. The two common stitches are suitable for sewing the abdomen and other surgeries on the body, while the other two specialized stitches apply to all surgeries except they are most specifically used in sewing the abdomen.
And I will describe to you one with explanation and statement. If the wound is small and something of pus comes out, making its reinsertion difficult, this can happen for two reasons: either because of the small size of the puncture as we said, or because the air's cold has caused expansion within the pus before its introduction.
If that's the case, it should be heated by immersing a sponge or a wet puncture in hot water alone, or perhaps boiled with dates, saffron and ginger. The pus should be rubbed until the expansion resolves.
And one can do this by drinking the drink with its alcoholic content, which is better than water alone in dissolving expansion. When you see that the expansion has dissolved, then bathe the pus with water that has been boiled with garlic or bread dough; he will flow more smoothly into him due to this.
If returning it after this treatment is impossible, then slightly cut into the puncture using the tool that cuts the stitches. The first operation becomes preferable than cutting if successful. It is necessary to cut later only when all alternatives fail; here's how the tool looks like:.
To be one of its ends bent and the other unlimited, the delicate end should not be sharpened like a lancet but slightly blunt, it is an instrument resembling a small sword as you see. If the wound widens and the organs enter, it should return to its natural shape.
If it is possible to place him where he desires, it would be better. But if the perforation is extensive and located at the bottom of the abdomen, then the patient should lie on his back with his legs higher than his head. If it's in the upper part of the abdomen, then the head and chest should be raised above the lower parts.
And similarly, if the perforation is on one of the two sides of the abdomen, always make your aim and intention to have the side with the surgery higher than the other side. This way, it should be used in great surgeries and also in medium ones.
And for small surgeries, place him according to what you can do. Then prepare by your side a servant who holds the entire opening with both hands and closes his lips. After that, he reveals something step by step to those sewing after each other.
This is the general principle of simple stitching. It involves taking a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound, then leaving from one side of the opening an amount corresponding to the thickness of the intestine. Then you pierce one needle without inserting any thread into the edge of the skin. With the edges of the fascia beneath the skin from inside until you pierce it from that side. Having gathered my skin margins and my fascial margins, there are four threads now. Then, draw a double thread around the needle, pulling on both sides several times until the wound edges meet tightly together.
Then leave a tough thread of the finger and insert another needle, then fasten it with the string as was done with the first needle. It will continue doing this with whatever needles she needs until she drains all the wound completely, making the needles medium in length between the tightness and softness.
Because the very thin needles cut through meat and tendons quite quickly, making it difficult to enter the skin. Therefore, it should be medium in softness and tightness. It's not advisable to insert the needle close enough to the edge of the skin by a slim margin.
So that the flesh doesn't cut through too quickly and the wound doesn't open before it heals, and not to sew too far apart so that the wound can't heal. Then cut off the ends of the needles so they don't harm the patient when sleeping and make him cotton ties from all sides for them to hold onto the ends of the needles.
And leave it until you know that the wound has healed. This type of needle stitching is so appropriate in small surgeries because it may be enough to stitch with one or two needles, or about that number.
Or for the second common type of stitching, you gather by sewing the four edges, meaning the flaps of skin and pleat of the chest in one go with a needle that has coiled thread moderately soft and tight. Then when this four flaps have been sewn out through the needle's starting point, I brought back the needle from that side itself.
So the thread should be tangled from above the wound, making the stitching according to the stitch used in tightening the camel bag and placing a small tightness between each stitch and the next after that of the small finger's thread. This type of stitching is known by all people.
With this kind of suture, surgery was performed on a man who had been wounded by a knife. The incision in the surgery exceeded one handbreadth and blood had flowed out from his abdomen towards two handbreadths from the middle intestine. The wound was located in the center of the abdomen.
He healed after allowing his wound to ooze out externally for twenty-four hours. The healing process took about fifteen days and he was treated until he recovered and lived for many years, managing all situations well. The doctors would determine that he did not fully recover.
And it is surprising that I did not treat him with ointment because at the place where there was no medicine, I used to apply old cotton on the wound twice a day and promised washing it with honey water until he recovered.
And as for the two types of special stitches, I remember Galen's description: you should start stitching from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside. When the needle has penetrated both the skin and the underlying muscle in a straight line across the entire abdomen.
I left the wound opening on the side where I inserted the needle and penetrated through its edge from outside to inside. Then, after passing through that other flap of the incision in the colon, when it was passed through, I passed it again through this same flap from inside to outside.
And leave the wound opening on this side of the scrotum and insert the needle through its other edge from inside to outside. And when you complete this, push it into the colon flap in its area until all of them are penetrated.
Then also begin from the same side and line up with the scrotal flap on the other side of this side, remove the needle from the skin near it. Then fold back that skin and mark the scrotal flap on the other side together with this colon flap.
Remove it from the skin on its side, do this again and again, performing it repeatedly until you suture all of the surgery on that example. And the full description of this suturing is that it should sew with the stitch pattern of the camel's hair.
By stitching the wound once on one side with a fold of the skin and leaving it on the other side until it drains, as for the second type of special suturing mentioned by Galen, this is his textual description.
And it is that you stitch it on a model where some of the surgeons stitch, bringing each part together with its natural counterpart; they gather the edge of the wound to its other edge and the edge of the discharge sack to its own edge. This results in what I describe to you.
It is necessary that you insert the needle into the edge of the discharge sack near to you from outside, then penetrate it inside only and leave its edge. Then return the needle and pass through both of their edges respectively from outside to inside, then return it also.
And you pass it from inside to outside in the edge of the other discharge sack on the opposite side, this method of suturing is better than the easy common sewing which it was mentioned before. This is as Galen described textually, and some have said that stomach stitching could be done with two needles. And this means to insert a single thread into both of them and start by inserting the needle from your side, then passing it to the other side. Insert the other needle from the opposite side of its own, passing it from your side according to the sewing of asafettes (eye surgeons) either way.
And be aware that if the puncture is in the middle of the abdomen, its suturing is harder than the others, and as for treating the wound, it has to follow the rules of other surgical treatments. For when you clean the wound with blood before it changes due to air and restore the flesh and sew it properly, you will support it with meat glue.
If the wound has changed due to air, carry it on some of the ointments that cure it until pus is discharged and threads are removed, and the wound heals. Then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals completely.
If no medicines are available, clean the wound with cotton that starts discharging pus and change it twice a day as I have taught you until it heals. In most cases, you won't need any other treatment if the wounds are simple. Don't worry about sharing the pain of the wound with the main organs because there is usually no additional suffering
You should dip our wool in moderately heated oil or rose oil, and place it around the areas between the ribs and the sternum. If you feel pain or a sensation of hotness in his body, this often indicates that he is suffering from wind accumulation. In such cases, you should treat him with a tight black, cooling drink.
Especially if the wind has accumulated in his body to a point where it has become an open wound reaching inside, you should know that if his intestines were thickened, recovery would be easier; and if they were thin, recovery would be more difficult.
As for the intestines of a fasting person, they do not accept recovery through surgery because of their many blood vessels and bones. Their soft nature is also close to that of nerves. As for what has protruded from the wound being a hole and was soft, return it according to your response on your intestines, either way.
If the time has passed and it has turned green or black, you should tighten a thread over the area that has darkened so as not to cause bleeding. There are blood vessels and arteries in the hole, then cut everything below this bandage.
You should make the two ends of the thread attached from below outside the operation, making it easier for you to pull and remove them upon the occurrence of a pus pocket or infection in the wound. If an injury occurs inside the abdomen, however, and is small.
It is possible that they might withstand some people, as I have seen a man who had been impaled in his abdomen with an arrow and the wound was to the right of the stomach; I examined the wound and it became inflamed, causing bowel movements and gas to come out from it. I took care of him believing that I did not hope for his recovery. I continued to nurse him until he recovered and the wound healed, but when I saw that the area had healed, I feared for his welfare that something bad might happen inside his body. Fortunately, nothing of grave ill happened to him from it, and he remained in excellent health. He is fine, eats and drinks, has sexual relations, uses the bathhouse, and conducts his religious ablutions, performing his religious duties. Some of those familiar with experience have mentioned that when an injury occurs inside the abdomen and it's small, it should be treated like this.
It involves taking large ants, then gathering their mouths together over the wound. Then place an ant with its mouth open on the wound; when it catches hold and tightens its mouth, its head will be cut off and stick there without coming loose. Then place another ant near the first one.
Continue doing this with multiple ants equal to the size of the wound, then move it and stitch the wound. Those heads stick inside the abdomen until the stomach heals and recovers; no harm will befall him. It might also be possible for the intestines to stick together using a fine thread as well.
The one who pulls from the crocodile, after entering an animal and it has stuck to him, is that he takes the end of this thread from the crocodile. He pulls nicely then ties a thin cotton thread, wound, at its end. Then he enters that thread into the needle. In it is thread from the crocodile, which touches the internal organs, then returns to the abdomen. This kind of stitching with thread and crocodile's hair is indeed through desire and hope.
But if the tear is large and extensive, especially if it's in one of the narrow intestines, there's no trick or escape from that fundamentally.
The sixty-eighth chapter.
In treating the sore throat and the neck.
Know that every wound or tumor, if it becomes chronic and degenerates into a ulcer without healing, and continues to produce pus constantly, not ceasing, is called generally as 'nasour' in any organ, and we call it 'zakam', and 'nasour'.
Actually, it's a complicated intertwined hard white mass with no pain, having a cavity like that of bird feathers.
For this reason, some have called it feather. It may sometimes be wet and continuously produce pus, or the dampness might dry up at times. The amount of dampness could be abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
And among the operations discussed in this section when mentioning ulcers, it is that every ulcer that doesn't heal or grow flesh therein, it's due to one of nine reasons; any of them could be either due to scarcity of blood in the body, or deficiency thereof, or because there might be hard flesh inside and at its edges, preventing growth of good flesh. Whether it is characterized by abundant pus and putrefaction, or because the ulcer itself is infected with a poor quality substance that seeps out, or because the medicine prescribed for treatment is incompatible, or due to infection from the local area of gangrene, or due to a specific condition in the locality.
Whether it is characterized by abundant pus and putrefaction, or because the ulcer itself is infected with a poor quality substance that seeps out, or because the medicine prescribed for treatment is incompatible, or due to infection from the local area of gangrene, or due to a specific condition in the locality. As discussed in the city of Sircastilla where healing of diseases is difficult and the natural cure for tumors slows down, either there is a single bone or several bones in it. All these reasons, their signs and treatments with medicines have been illustrated in this section.
And here I should introduce you to the treatment of nerves and pinches that occur via hand action; know that nerves can happen in all body parts, from them nerves go to great veins or arteries or to a nerve.
Or to the chest or to the lungs or to the bladder, or to a part of the back ribs, or to a segment in the spinal segments, like the hand and foot, and from them it can lead to near proximity to a main member and such.
If this is the case with these nerves in this manner, they are among the easy diseases that recover without treatment and it's a bother and ignorance to deal with them. But if there were nerves that didn't reach the places I mentioned, and you hoped for and longed for their treatment.
And I wanted to understand this, so take a copper or iron probe. If the nerve runs straight, probe it with it; if there is elevation in the nerve, use a thin lead probe because lead smooths its body.
It becomes slippery upon entry and bends towards the elevation. If the nerve has many openings that you cannot identify with the probe, then insert a mouth into one of its openings. The wetness injected inside will flow towards the other mouths and drain out.
Then inquire about the examination on how you can determine if there is a bone or nerve, or if the canal was deep or close, or if it had one single mouth. Stand by all this with the extent of your ability to assess its absence or pain when you rub your hand over the area.
And in this way, when you have stood firm on all these indications and facts concerning the tumor, then indeed you can trust for treatment based on observation. If it is confirmed thus.
The canal appears nearby or in a safe location away from joints, nerves, arteries, veins or any of the places mentioned to you. You should cut through the canal according to the description provided and remove the intertwined tissues as well as the rotten and excessive meat.
And if there is meat or a wound growing in its mouth, like that, and you treated until it heals. If the canal has a deep bottom and stands straight, it would be necessary to cut into it as deeply as possible then clean it of all its rotten meat.
Then use the powdered root in the strong medicines and insert it into the canal of the canal that you have identified with iron. Do this repeatedly until that strong medicine has consumed all the remaining decay at the bottom of the canal.
Then force it with remedies that promote healthy tissue growth, until it heals. If it does not heal this way, perform surgery as described before. If the cause of the canal is bone and you find it appropriate, dissect and cut it according to what I told you, unless something prevents you.
Or a nerve or an important organ as we said. If the bone is exposed to you and there is some decay and darkness within it, strip it until its decay disappears then treat it with what makes it heal, until it heals. If it does not heal and continues to produce pus as it was doing.
Know that you have not reached complete removal of the decay, so uncover everything again upon it, investigate its detachment and purify it with your utmost effort, then force it. If it is free from decay and if not, know that this decay lies far away from the decay; so uncover everything again.
And investigate its detachment and purify it with your utmost effort; if the decayed bone is a small bone, you can manage to pull it out. Pull it using soft forceps that are suitable for this task.
If there are many bones, investigate their extraction one by one and leave nothing from your effort. If something in the ligaments obstructs you that is not dangerous in its section, cut those ligaments and any remaining flesh, then free the bones.
If it doesn't allow you to extract the bones in time, cover the wound with what cleanses it and leave it for days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones decompose. Keep the wound open so that the cut you made during your work does not heal.
But put on it, if you fear that, a cotton ball soaked in powdered sulfuric ketone mixed with oil or a cotton ball soaked in Egyptian mazkara or any green ointment. When those ligaments decompose and the bones soften, it will be easier to extract and pull them.
If it's a large bone, like the thigh bone or similar ones, and only its face was affected by decay, strip it completely down to remove that blackness and decay. Then force the wound, if the decay affected a big part of the bone and reached through the marrow, it will be necessary to spread it out.
Cut it all the way until where decay ends. Then force him, so that he heals properly. I tell you of a case where a man was exposed to a complaint in his leg, making him an example and aid for your treatment; this person had aged.
At around thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to an internal movement within the body. This caused substances to connect with the leg resulting in swelling and formation of a large lump. There was no external cause for this. Over time, due to errors by the doctors, the abscess opened.
Large amounts were secreted from it and its treatment was mishandled to such an extent that the leg became infected, developing numerous openings all of which expel pus and body fluids. It took a group of doctors about two years to deal with this situation, but there was no skilled surgeon among them.
Until he came to see me. When I saw his leg and the fluids flowing from those openings, it was like a massive stream. His body had decayed and his skin turned yellow. So I inserted the needle into one of these openings; the needle led to the bone. Then, I opened all the other openings.
I found that some of them connected to each other from all directions of the leg, so I started cutting into one of those openings until I exposed some bone. I found it decayed, blackened and putrid, with bones protruding, until I reached the marrow cavity; spreading what was revealed to me.
I was able to remove the putrid bone as I believe there was no other decay in the bone that I cut and spread. Whatever I removed, then I made it stitch the wound with antiseptic for a longer period; but it didn't heal. Then I again opened up the bone above the first exposure.
I found the decay connected to the bone, spreading whatever I could see of that decay as well. I forced stitches on him but they didn't heal; he didn't stitch up or heal. Then I opened it again, and kept cutting parts of the bone and trying to stitch them, yet nothing healed until I cut about a hand length of the bone.
He removed it with his stomach, then stabilized him with medications; he recovered quickly and was released. This repetition in his operation and its complexity was necessary due to the weakness of the patient, low probability of recovery, and my fear of death for him because he would excessively drain himself at all times due to a poor response, resulting in complete and total recovery.
A hard piece of flesh grew in the place of the bone. His condition improved within his body, and he regained strength, behaving well under circumstances without facing any serious harm during walking as long as it was not in a broken bone area of the body.
You should apply this method, which involves taking a strap and tightening it at the end of the bone that has grown out. You would have someone lift him up while you are above him, using another thicker strap made from wool compared to the first one.
Then, attach him to the flesh underneath the bone and extend its end to pull the flesh downwards as you expose the area you want to expand. Make sure not to harm the pulled flesh. Place a board or plank firmly under the bone from below.
Because if you do that, the bleeding will not stop from cutting through the rotten bone. It is necessary to have some expansion above the decayed area so it does not create a new decay inside the bone which would not be noticeable for touch. Therefore, you may need to expand it again later.
If the bone is rotten and not growing, but instead some parts are connected to each other with decay in the middle or in parts of it, expose the flesh from all its sides. Then place the plank from below. Finally, expand it from the first side where decay is present.
When you're done expanding from one side, expand it from the other side. The expansion should be slightly away from the decay as we explained, if decay is in a joint cut out that diseased segment itself and expand the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of joints, there is no trick other than stripping off (the affected area), if the corruption is in the hand or body hair, treating it is very difficult indeed. But you should peel off as much of the corruption as visible to you and strip it off, clean it however you can.
By what trick do you align yourself when there is no obstacle of sweat or nerve, and know that the cuts and grooves for these bones vary a lot depending on the position of the bones, their orientation, hardness, porosity, size, and whether they are big or small, as well as their stiffness and translucency. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare machinery for each type of work for that specific purpose.
And know that the works themselves can guide you on what kind of machinery you need if you have a long journey and understanding the arts of this trade is important because it enhances expertise in the craft and allows you to witness various diseases. One can derive for themselves what tools correspond to each illness, and I will illustrate several tools in the final part of this chapter.

Chapter seventy-eight.
In cutting limbs and dispersing bones.
Limbs may rot either from a cause outside or inside. If the decay caused by this is treated with medical remedies and they do not work, and you see the decay advancing in the member without anything deterring it.
It is necessary to cut that limb up to where the decay has spread, so that you can blame death or great suffering for it rather than losing the member. A sign that this might happen is when the limb dominates until you think the fire has burned it.
Or if it whitens after the blackness, until this decay advances beyond that limb and invades a part of the body as a whole, you should act quickly to cut it off. Similarly, if the cause of decay is due to being bitten by some pests such as sea snakes or snakes or worms, etc., then do the same.
If the decay or sore is in a finger, cut off the finger; do not let the decay spread to the hand. Similarly, if there's an infection taken up in the hand, cut it off from its origin at the wrist; do not let the decay spread until it reaches the elbow joint.
Likewise, if it spreads to the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow joint in that same joint, if the decay is allowed to spread and reaches near the knee, do not simply amputate the knee. In that case, there would be death of one's limbs. Instead, apply other medical treatments according to their ability.
In the case of decay spreading within a toe, cut off the toe at one of the joints. If it spreads into the foot shaft, amputate the entire leg. Should it ascend to the knee, then cut off the thigh at its joint.
If the infection has reached above the knee, there is no remedy other than to leave it and allow the affected limb to die. The prescription for amputating or spreading an infection involves tying a bandage below the part you wish to cut off, and another bandage above the part.
One attendant holds the lower band down, and the other holds the upper band up. You then cut or spread out the meat between the two bands until all of it is exposed. It is recommended to have small pieces of cotton from every side for puncturing.
To prevent the blade from cutting at the wrong spot causing unnecessary pain and a hot swelling for the patient, if there is bleeding during your work, quickly stop the operation or apply some clotting agents to the wound then continue with your treatment until it has drained.
Then, bandage the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. And I shall provide you an example to illustrate this issue of the disease affecting both feet which I will describe for you. This case was when there appeared a darkness along with burning like fire in one foot.
The corruption was the first to occur in his finger until he lost all of it. The man liberated himself from it when he saw the corruption making its way into the member with such intensity that he felt great pain and burning only cutting at the joint freed him.
And when a long time passed, this corruption appeared to him in the same finger of his left hand. He showed it to me and I treated it by applying medicines that I had prepared after cleaning his body. The medicine did not deter the corruption, but it continued spreading to the other finger.
The corruption had advanced to his hand, so he asked me to amputate it. I refused him out of mercy and concern for the spread of this corruption. I was also afraid that he might die upon cutting off his hand due to his weakened state. When he did not relent, he returned to his homeland.
I heard that he managed to amputate his entire hand and was freed from the corruption. I share this story in order to serve as a guide for what might happen with cases of this disease, serving as a reference and a principle by which one should act.
The eighty-first chapter.
In treating abscesses and the method of administering medications to them.
If a tumor occurs in some meaty organs and the tumor lasts for an extended period until it has gathered the duration, then it explodes or bursts and all that was inside of it from time comes out, leaving the place empty as if it were a vessel.
The skin on top is like a wound, having thickened but not being excessively corrupted that it would affect bone or nerve or ligament. From this, it deserves to be called an abscess and not a tumor, unless its duration extends to affect something of these organs due to the corruption.
When then it is called a nashura or zakama, and its cure is to cut all that skin as it turns and especially if it has whitened and become like a scratch and shecertains that it does not stick to its place due to its decay.
If you hope that the skin will stick and it has not reached the extent of decay to that point, there is a thickening of flesh in the skin. In this case, it should be treated with cauterization. This involves looking for the source; if it's large and the pus coming from it has an unpleasant smell, then it should be treated with Egyptian medicine.
That is a concoction of wax, oil, honey, and snail parts. They are mixed together in a pot and cooked on fire until the medicine thickens like honey. Then you take what you need and mix it with water and honey. You then inject this into the source and tighten its opening. Leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then, you squeeze it through pressing. You do this for several days until the source cleans up and gets rid of the pus. If this medicine does not suit you, then you can inject it with ashes water. That is taking wood ashes from carob or oak trees and pouring water on them.
Then, prepare it and inject it until you confirm that the source has been cleansed. If there is no pus left, either apply Egyptian medicine or ashes water. Otherwise, inject it with honey water in which a little powdered snail is mixed.
Or, you can inject it with honey and wine mixed together because the characteristic of honey is to cleanse and clean, while the wine sticks to the source. Especially if there is a good retention in the wine, when you do this several times and are sure that decay has left the source, then inject what grows from the flesh there.
Like taking asphaltum, clarifying it with camphor oil and rose water or injecting some medications and other ointments whose properties we have proven in the article on ointments, if the hiding place's mouth is narrow and does not accommodate the catheter tube.
Expand it slightly with iron or put a twisted thin thread in the Egyptian asphaltum ointment or Seiroun's ointment so that it expands. Also, if the mouth is also wide, stitch together its lips and leave enough so that the catheter tube enters without excess.
Similarly, if its mouth from which the pus flows is elevated upwards, split it in the lowest place where it can flow downwards. Because pus when it gets stuck in the pit of the hiding place prevents the flesh from growing there.
If you cannot split the hiding place downwards as desired, it is preferable to erect the member so that pus can easily flow out from it according to what becomes available for you. It should not leave any part of pus stuck in it at all.
As for the plaster medications that are placed on the hiding place from outside, and how to place them on it, you should take one of the problematic ointments that suits what you want and extend it over a cotton wick. And let the wick be as much as covers all of the hiding place entirely. Then, cut with the scissors a hole in front of the hiding place's mouth that is slightly wider than the hiding place's mouth. Then, spread some soft ointment over another wick according to the size of the hole and put it on top, laying it apart from the hiding place's mouth so as to facilitate the pus to come out without removing the large wick until after it has been done.
Several days, and as for the pus-filled wound, it is removed whenever necessary to remove what has collected in phlegm and to determine whether the discharge is abundant or scanty, whether it is ripe or not.
And yet, you also examine the location of the pus itself to see if its owner feels pain or not, and whether there is a lump there or not. If your treatment proceeds in this manner and you find that only little material comes out from the mouth of the pus, then you have seen the substance coming out.
Know that the pus pocket has stuck or is close to sticking, then on the next day or in the third day resolve it and when the wound heals replace the opening with another one and renew the ointment. If pus comes out from the pus pocket after a long time, don't give up hope for its adherence.
He heals close by, for some people delay the growth of tissue in their wounds and others oppose this. If pus comes out after many days that is not ripe, then know that the pus pocket has not adhered; if the adherence to the pus pocket is delayed.
If his treatment goes on for a long time, increase the drying of medicines. Let these medicines have their substance wet and their strength dry like dried quince ointment; if it has been increased in its goodness, add more quercetin. Among what is most effective in treating is to take the dried quince ointment.
He resolves it with the application of turmeric, then sprinkles on him moderate old aged vinegar. He kneads it and uses it, and he may perform such an act if dried quince ointment is not available when you boil it until it thickens and use it or take honey and lemon and crush all of them and leave them on the honey which is on fire. Then it is rubbed with a scratch and tension is applied to the wound or it is rubbed with honey that was cooked until it thickens, hardens, and medicines are applied upon it. A scratch is placed on top and tension is applied.
And in such cases, long whips and the root of mastic tree or ground turmeric, and coriander seeds, or a mixture that is pounded and sieved before being mixed with cooked honey are used. If the wound does not heal despite this treatment, it means there's decay deep within.
And if it affects the bones or other hard nerves or ligaments, the treatment of nacoura (a type of herb) should be followed as described above.
Chapter Ninety-Eight.
In treating the gout, overgrowth of nails, cutting off excess fingers, and splitting joint fusions.
The gout refers to excessive flesh growing under the thumb nail of the hand or foot, and it might grow on other fingers as well. If left untreated for a long time, it becomes swollen and very hot.
Or it could rot the nail bed until it eats away at the base of the nail, and maybe even destroys all of it. It might spread to the bone causing a foul smell, making the tip of the finger broad and changing its color to yellowish. If you treat it with what we have described in this section and your treatment does not work.
You should cut all the excess that grows from the nail with iron, then dress the wound afterwards. Cutting in this way is very effective. If the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy,
The corner of the scullbone had pushed the flesh inwards and made it harden and decay. It would be advisable to place a thin pad under the corner of the scullbone that hardens the flesh and lifts it upwards, then gently cut that hardened flesh.
Place on the remaining meat whatever strong-smelling medicines there are until it disappears completely, then treat it with salves until it heals. If decay has affected the bone, you should cut out that bone and remove it; for what is rotten cannot heal properly while rotten bone remains.
If I see decay and rot advancing in the finger, cut it at one of its knuckles as described, then treat it until it heals. If a blow or an ulcer causes severe pain in the bone or nail bed, it is necessary to remove the ulcer first.
Then cut the nail with a sharp punch, making a slanted cut from above to below. Ensure that the cut does not reach the flesh underneath the nail; you will cause extreme pain and a painful scar in this location when you do so. Then treat the area with remedies to soothe the pain.
And as for the extra finger that is born in some people's hands, it might be entirely fatty tissue. It might also contain bones or a nail and have growing tissue at the base of one of the joints in some fingers.
Or its growth might be in some knuckles of the finger and not move. The one that grows at the joint of the finger might move. What came from it if it was only flesh, cut it easily; this is to cut it right after where it originates with a broad punch.
If it grows from the root of the joint, treatment is difficult and involves cutting off its source, whereas if it grows on one of a pair's fingers, it should first be cut with a straight incision towards the bone, then spread out using one of those spreaders compatible with that.
Then heal him until he recovers. As for adhesion between some of the fingers, it often occurs and is something humans are born with. It happens upon the healing of a wound or burn and so forth. It should be that this adhesion be cut open.
Until the fingers return to their natural shape. Then place between them a strip or incision moistened with rose oil, so that they do not adhere quickly and spread apart or leave a thin sheet of lead in between them until the site heals as it should.
And similarly, if adhesion occurs between some fingers of the hand, cut that adhesion according to what becomes ready and suitable for the shape of the organ.
The ninety-first section.
In severing the ducts.
The ducts are twisted, thick tubes filled with black pus that occur in most body organs, and especially in the legs. In them, it is best to begin by purging the body from the black discharge several times with vigorous purges.
Then remove the basilex with it. As for treatment with iron, there are two ways: one is to cut and expel the black blood and its symptoms, while the other is to sweat and expel everything together from that perspective. For cutting off, the leg first touches hot water gently yes.
Until the thick, sticky blood is dissolved, then lift the thigh of the patient from above his knee to below it using a sheet. Then make one or two or three wide incisions in the place where you are operating.
Then, with your hand, remove the black blood from the bottom of the leg to the top and then vice versa until you have removed enough or as much as can bear by the strength of the patient. Then tie him up and order him to avoid foods that cause the black menses to recur, and then re-bleeding and fasting should be done again.
When the veins are full and it harms the patient, but if he sweats profusely then his legs will have hair removed. Then he should take a bath and soak his legs in hot water until they turn red or he exercises vigorously.
If he does not take a bath until the member heats up, then make an incision against the hair in one length either at its end near the knee or at the bottom near the heel. Then open the skin with slits and remove the sweat from all sides until it becomes visible to touch.
When it appears, you see that it is red. Once the skin has been removed, you'll also notice that it resembles a tendon. Then insert beneath it tightly until it rises and exits the skin. Attach it with a dark smooth thread. Then make another incision nearby up to three fingers away from this first incision.
Then remove the skin above the sweat until it becomes visible, lift him using a ligature as before and attach him with another thread as first. Then make another incision or multiple incisions if necessary.
Then wash him and cut him in the end of the incision at the heel, then pull him and wash him until he comes out through the second incision, then pull him towards the incision above it and do this until you pull him from the third incision highest among them all, until he has completely come out. Then cut him.
And if he does not move by pulling and washing, enter in a needle with strong thread that is doubled, bind it, pull him, and put under the protrusion. Feel with your hand until you reach every direction until it comes out. Keep track of the thread so that it doesn't break. If it breaks, it will make your task to wash him very difficult indeed.
And if you find a hard knot on the inside, heave it out. Once all is washed off, place wool soaked in a mixture of wine, oil and grease at the site of the operation until he recovers. If the hard knot has many ridges that bend towards different sides, take care during treatment.
And if it is not straight as we said, you should cut it at every point where its ridges and areas of elevation are located. Then attach it to the reed until you can wash it thoroughly; when cutting on top of it, watch that you don't split or cut it because this makes washing him harder. So exert caution in your efforts.
The image of the incision through which you extract the knot:.
Image of the blind reed:.
It should not have a stopper like in other reeds and its tip should not be sharp so as not to cut the hair. It must be thick when bent but smooth, because if it is thin, it will cut due to its sharpness; however, its thickness can be advantageous as we explained.
The ninety-fourth and fifth chapter.
In the treatment of local sweating.
This sweat is produced in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and Arab countries, as well as in other fertile hot regions. It might also occur in parts of the body other than the legs due to an infection that happens beneath the skin.
It also occurs within living and rotting organisms, maggots of lice, maggots between the skin and flesh. A sign that this sweat begins is when intense reddening happens in the leg followed by evaporation from the area, then sweating starts to appear at that evaporation point.
As if it were the root of a plant or an animal, if one of its parts appears, then there should be wrapping around a small piece of lead which weighs from one dirham to two dirhams, tying it up and leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
Every time something comes out to the outside, wrap it in lead and tie it up. If it takes a long time, cut off some of it and wrap the rest, but don't cut it from its root before all of it has come out because if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh causing swelling and infection at that spot and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be pushed and pulled gently until it comes out of its end and nothing remains in the body. This kind of sweat may come out from some people up to a length of five span lengths and ten.
And it has reached me that a man had sweat come out from twenty cubits. If you stop during his treatment, insert a tube into the hole and push it gently for a long time in conjunction with his body until all substances inside have drained away, then try to heal the area with medications for several days.
Then he treated him with tumors' treatment, and this may be a river of many kinds, especially if it appears in the joint or in the body itself; it causes numerous mouths to appear and for each mouth to have its own branch. We have mentioned this division as well as what has been stated previously.
The Second and Ninetieth Chapter.
In the fissure of the worm that is generated under the scrotum, it is called the cow's cause.
This disease is called in some of our countries, the cow's cause, because it often happens to cows. It is a small single worm that reproduces between the skin and the flesh and moves throughout the whole body upwards and downwards.
It becomes apparent through touching during rubbing from one part of the body to another until it penetrates where it did not penetrate in the skin at a point, and it emerges and forms due to infection by mixing some substances as happens with worms and water fleas in the belly.
It is expected from its damage that if it moves in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it might open there and come out, causing blindness. This happens frequently. If you want to treat her and remove her, this can only happen when rubbing her and becoming aware of her through touching.
You should pull what is above and below her with a strong tourniquet, then cut her and extract her. If she has submerged in the flesh and you do not find her, apply heat on that area as if by fire until it burns her, and be aware of the greatest expected damage to the eye as we said.
If you see that it has become in the head near the eye, pull under it on the forehead with a strong tourniquet, then cut her and extract her. It is necessary that he agrees to cleanse his body using medicines that facilitate the elimination of bad infected mixtures, and to be cautious about food that causes infection.
Chapter Thirty-Nine
In the section on the disease known as nafar.
This disease, which in our country is called nafar, is a pain that appears in some organs then moves from one organ to another. I have seen it as I am describing it to you.
I was summoned to attend a withered woman in some valleys. I uncovered her arm and felt a slight puff of air beneath the skin of the elbow, which continued for an hour. Then, I saw this puff move along with the pulse rhythmically as fast as lead going up to her knee.
If the pain moved from one place to another, it would leave that area and settle in her knee. After sitting for an hour, it spread throughout her entire body until it reached the other arm. She also told me that her whole body was moving like what I saw.
I was amazed by the speed of its movement from one organ to another; I had not seen this disease displayed in such a manner before, as many people would experience pain moving from one body part to another but I witnessed it only in this woman.
I could only conclude that this was due to the fact that she was from the desert people, with a dry body and exposed skin. This is how the moving breeze became apparent through touch; it would not show in the same manner for those who live comfortably with their moist and hidden body surfaces.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels pain, as we have described when it becomes visible through touch, hold something above it and below it with a wheel, and cut him until that trapped wind emerges and removes the discomfort.
If you do not see it with your eyes, then take recourse to purging the body and what repels wind and disperses it, like the berries of anthraipsis, the berries of scotospinus, and similar medications.
The fourth and ninety-first chapter.
In the removal of arrows.
Arrows can vary according to their types and the parts of the body they are in. Their differences by type include large and small ones, with some being hollow glass and others filled with poison. Some arrows have three angles and others four.
Some arrows have tongues and others fragments. As for those that vary according to the body parts they are in, there are two types: either the organs are from main hollow ones like brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, stomach and so on. When an arrow is in one of these organs and you see the signs of death that I will describe to you later, it would be wise to avoid removing that arrow. Death often follows for its owner under such circumstances. And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the organ, extract it and treat the wound. As for symptoms of the brain if hit by an arrow and the bone has been pierced with a wound on the brain, he is exposed to severe headache, fever, and dizziness.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the organ, extract it and treat the wound. As for symptoms of the brain if hit by an arrow and the bone has been pierced with a wound on the brain, he is exposed to severe headache, fever, and dizziness. And redness in both eyes, red tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, vomiting once or maybe blood comes out from the nostrils or ears. Maybe speech is lost and sound goes away. A white moisture appears that resembles dough coming out from the wound, and it flows like meat water.
If you observe these signs, refrain from treating the wound and removing the arrow if it has not been removed. And regarding indications of the presence of the arrow if it has hit the heart and is near the left breastbone, feel as though it is embedded in something solid, not in a void.
Perhaps the arrow moves like a heartbeat, causing black blood to seep from the wound. Following this, if limbs turn cold and there is cold sweat with death on the way, you should know that death is inevitable. And when the arrow wounds the lung, be aware of bleeding from the wound that appears as greasy blood.
The veins near the neck may swell, and the heart rate may change. The breath becomes deep, demanding cold air to be inhaled. If the arrow has pierced the chest wall, it is usually close to the smaller ribs, causing intense pain with heavy breathing.
He/she pants and all abdominal organs move. If the arrow hit the liver, intense pain follows and blood resembling liver in color seeps out of the wound. If the arrow pierces the stomach, there might be some undigested food coming out of the wound that is not supposed to be there.
It is obvious, and if the arrow hit the abdomen causing it to swell and some feces leaked out of the wound or abscess or urine started leaking, there's no hope for treatment nor extraction of the arrow. If the arrow hit the bladder and urine started leaking.
Something protruded from it outward and the pain intensified for the patient, know that he is dying. As for other body parts such as the face, eye, neck, shoulder, back muscles, vertebral column, thighs, legs and others like them have received the worst outcome.
When the arrow misses a vessel or nerve and was not poisoned, I shall inform you about some things that I have seen concerning these arrows so that they may guide your treatment. Specifically, an arrow struck a man in his eye's socket near the base of his nose.
He removed it for him from the other side under the earlobe and it was clean, causing nothing bad to happen in his eye, and he removed another arrow for a Jew who had hit him under his lower eyelid under the cheek. The arrow had disappeared inside, but it only left behind its small tip that sticks into the wood.
The arrow was large, from the composite arrows of the Roman's, square iron, smooth without fins; it freed the Jew and nothing bad happened to his eye. I removed another arrow from a Canaanite's neck; the arrow was Arabic.
It was the one with two fins that split through his nostrils; it had pierced his neck and he died from it until we were able to remove him, thus sparing the Canaanite and freeing him. I removed another arrow for a man who hit him in his stomach, we estimated that he would die of it.
And when thirty days or about that time passed and there was no change in his condition, I cut through the arrow and it transformed onto it, then I removed it; he recovered without any bad event occurring to him. And I saw a man struck with an arrow on his back; the wound adhered to him.
And when seven years had passed, the arrow came out from his ankle. I saw a woman who was struck in her womb with an arrow; the wound adhered to her and the arrow remained, yet nothing changed in her condition or did she find any harm in any of her natural actions.
I saw another man, an arrow struck him in the face and became stuck in the wound. He experienced little pain, for there are many like this. I removed an arrow from a commander of the Sultan who had been hit by one in the middle of his nose which tilted slightly to the right side.
The arrow completely exited the body. I was summoned to treat him three days after the arrow struck, finding the wound very narrow. Using a fine probe, I explored inside and did not feel any pain; he found hair and debris in the right side of his ear from the incision.
I concluded that the hair was from the edge of the arrow. I treated the wound with a dressing that has an adhesive and restorative properties, hoping for swelling in the area to show evidence of the arrow's presence. I pierced him, but there was no incident at the site indicating that the arrow had reached the location.
I continued to apply the dressing for a long time, and nothing happened. The wound eventually closed during that process and I could not make him remove it until one day he felt an arrow inside his nose; he informed me of this development. Therefore, I applied the strongest, concentrated medicine on the wound for many days.
Until it opened and I could penetrate to feel the thin tip of the arrow embedded in the wood. Then, I continued to widen the wound with this strong medicine until we were able to clearly see the arrow tip inside and followed him for a period of time extending up to four months.
Then, as the wound expanded and I was able to insert my clamps into it and move them around. The arrow did not respond to removal efforts; therefore, I continuously soothed him and adapted different tools on him until one day I held onto the arrow with tight clamps, just as they are depicted in the last illustration of this chapter.
And the doctors judged that the tissue of his nose cannot be forced; it is forcefully extracted and then the wound heals completely without harming him at all, I am informing you about how to remove some arrows in order to make this a measure and evidence for what I did not mention.
For the parts of this craft and their details cannot be grasped through description, nor can they encompass a book. Rather, the skillful maker measures with the small on the large, and he works according to what is present when what is absent is recalled; he infers new actions and new machines in unusual situations.
If we step away from this craft, then I will say that the arrows only emerge from the organs where they erupted in two ways: either through being drawn from the place it entered or from the other opposing side; and from wherever they entered.
Either the arrow sticks out in a fleshy area and it pulls out when you try to extract it, if it has not reached its exit time that was determined during his insertion, then you should let him rest for days until the flesh around it decays which will make it easier to pull it out and remove it. In case it erupted within bone tissue,
If it hasn't reached its exit time, leave it alone for days and try pulling and moving it each day; he will come out. If you have not been able to extract him after days, you should pierce around the arrow in the same bone from every side with a small hole until it expands for the arrow then pull and remove it.
If the arrow has erupted in the bone of the head and deeply penetrated one of the cavities of the brain, with some of those symptoms that I mentioned to you appearing from within him, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it alone until it heals after days.
If the arrow has been drawn out, if it is deeply embedded and not responding to pulling, use hooks around the arrow as you were shown. Then treat the area until it heals. If the arrow has become buried in a part of the body. If there is a loss of sensation, insert a probe to detect it. If you feel the object, pull it with some tools that are suitable for pulling objects out. If you cannot do so due to the narrowness of the wound and the deep placement of the object, or if there's no bone, nerve, or fluid there.
Cut him through until the wound widens and you can take hold of the arrow to remove it. If it has two ears that you can grab, remove all necrotic tissue from both sides in every way possible that you might do this, and enter if you cannot free the tissue by breaking the ears and piercing them until they release.
And when you try to remove the arrow in any location, use your fingers with all directions to extract it until you remove it. Provide utmost care so that the arrow doesn't break as this would make it more difficult for you to pull and remove it. If you are unable to do this due to lack of time.
Leave it for a few days until the flesh around it decays, then continue. It becomes easier at that point. If you encounter bleeding, apply the treatment we mentioned in its chapter and be cautious not to cut any veins or nerves or tendons. Use your ingenuity.
By every means you can complete the arrow extraction and let it be done gently, carefully, and firmly as I have described to you. It is necessary for you when drawing out the arrow that you revert its position to what it was before the incident occurred, as this is more suitable.
If you are unable to do that, use whatever forms you can. As for the arrow coming out from the opposite side, either there is something sticking out outside or you find part of the arrow by touch near the skin on top, and see it penetrating.
Cut it open and make the cut according to how much you can bear by squeezing the muscles, then pull it. It facilitates its exit. If it sticks in the bone, move your hand around until the arrow affects the bone and expands for itself, then pull it.
And otherwise, leave it for days to try again until it comes out. If the return of the arrow is there, push it with that. If the reed has fallen and you want to use pushing, insert the hollow machine into its tube which goes inside the quill's shaft then push it with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with a machine that enters that tube. The arrow can be easier to come out by this means, if the arrow is poisoned it may be necessary to cut all the tissue where the poison has spread if you can do so, then treat it accordingly.
If the arrow is in the chest or abdomen or bladder or side, and it's close to what is enclosed by the probe and you can cut it, then cut and be cautious not to cut a vein or nerve and remove it.
Then suture the wound if it needs stitching, then treat until it heals. The image of the muscles that attract arrows:
Its ends are tubular like a bird's beak, made to grip an arrow or any object without letting go, and it can be of various sizes: big, small, or medium, all depending on the size and weight of the arrow as well as the depth and narrowness of the wound.
The picture of the evacuated cannon:.
The picture of the grooved cannon:.
This is like a groove on the end, making it easier to enter and push into the evacuated arrow,.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
In chapter one of the arteries.
The arteries that are typically divided into segments in the body are thirty. There are sixteen arteries in the head: the two pulsating ones behind the ears, known as the vagi nerves, and the two in the jawbones which are called the lingual arteries. Additionally, there are the two arteries at the junction of the eyes, known as the optic arteries.
The artery that runs in the middle of the forehead, the one in the end of the nose and the two located in the neck. There are also the two arteries located on the upper lip of the mouth and the two arteries found below the tongue; these are known as the jejunar arteries.
As for the arteries that branch out in the arm and hand, they are five. One of them is the ulna, which comes from the back side. The general name for it is the 'head artery' or 'dark circle', this being the central artery, composed of a branch of the basilic vein and part of the ulnar artery, generally known as the body artery.
And the basilic vein, which is located on the inner side, it's also called the cubital. It's commonly known as the 'abdominal artery' and the 'arm cord', it's positioned on the humerus bone, the one that sticks out clearly above the thumb when seen from behind, and the axillary vein (s).
This is the stream located between the testicles and penis, having two branches. In the leg and foot there are three streams, one under the inner side of the knee joint on the back side and the second one which is on the front side, its place being at the heel from the inner side when it comes to the ankle bone stream for women and its position is in the back side from the outer side.
In the other leg there are three similar streams. As for the two veins behind the ears, their benefit is in releasing the constant discharges and wet dreams, as well as urine retention, and dealing with the constant severe head sores, and how to release them according to my description.
This involves shaving the head of the person and trimming its rear in the location of the veins, using a coarse but well-made tool for scraping. Then you strangle the person by their neck with a turban until the veins appear, and their location behind the ears in the lowered areas on the head can be found by examining them with your finger. Whenever you feel a pulse under your finger, that is where you will need to perform the operation using the ink.
Then take a thin tool called 'al-nsil' and insert it under the vein in the skin until you reach the bone with the tool. Then lift your hand holding the vein and the skin upwards, cutting the vein along with the skin into small pieces. The length of each piece should be as long as two fingers.
Or in a similar way, you send out the amount of blood that you want then tighten them with bandages and leave them until they heal. In the first book, it was mentioned to cut and twist them, whereas the two veins found in the axilla serve for the constant wet dreams, severe headache, persistent cold sweat, and rapid flow of urine directed to the eyes.
How to divide them, as I describe it, will make him draw the sheet around his neck until sweat appears visibly on his skin and its pulse becomes clear under your index finger. Then you learn with a stylus and raise the skin from above the armpit up to the armpit fold with your thumb.
The incision is made from below, lifting the armpit upwards and cutting it as you did with the others. You release blood to your required extent, then relieve the stranglehold on the sheet and place your finger on the armpit for a moment.
Then, place a cotton and bandage on it and pull from above tightly. Leave him until he recovers. The mention of cutting and sewing was in the first book. As for dividing forehead sweat glands, its benefit comes after dividing armpit glands to alleviate chronic facial issues like acne, boils, and rashes.
How to divide it, as I describe, will constrict the neck of the person with a sheet until sweat appears. Then you take the tool called a scalpel and this is its image:".
You place the blade of the scalpel that's at the tip on the same armpit and strike from above with a comb or something else towards it, allowing the blood to flow as you desire. Then relieve the sheet on him until he recovers.
And it may open with a wide incision, but it should not be pointed like other blades. It should have a slightly wide tip and be well defined for deviation because the bone is close. The instrument might break if it's too thin.
And as for the two armpits in the eye sockets, their benefit is against various diseases of the eye such as dropsy and rashes. As for how to divide them, it involves constricting his neck with a sheet until you can separate them standing at his head. Let the incision be slightly longer than its width using a small scalpel that's slightly wide.
If the place is without flesh, then if the incision is thin at the edge it might break. Then blood will be required from you and two pieces of cotton are placed on it overnight and they are tightened for one night and then released. As for a nostril fissure, feverish heat proves beneficial.
And the severe headache, and one of the face diseases like the red scarlet rash that appears in the nose, especially if it is chronic. And how to extract it is by pulling on his neck with the thread, then hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin long incision tool.
And insert it in the middle of the rabbit itself between the nostril stops on straightness because there is no sense here, blood seeps out of its socket, and you should hold your incision tool for a little while and send out your requirement from blood then bind him overnight as he dries quickly.
And as for the warts, it's beneficial to extract them because of constriction of breath and beginning of leprosy and black diseases that appear on the skin surface such as black peau d'orange, warts, bad sores, and ulcers. And how to extract them is by pulling the thread under them around his neck and standing the surgeon above the patient's head.
The surgeon stands on a stool, then extract the pus to its length slightly wider than narrow. Then remove an amount of blood that is moderate or according to what you see as required for it, and do this also with the other pus, then loosen the bandage afterwards.
And you pull the two pustules with an average tension so that it does not strangle the patient and leave him until tomorrow because the wound heals, as for pustules of the rash, it's beneficial to extract them after removing scabies that it is beneficial from acne in the mouth and decay of the gums and bad sores, and cracking of the lips and bad sores.
This is about what's inside the nose and around it, and how to place it in front of you so that you can pull his neck with a scarf. Then turn his lips and look at the two grooves you see; one on the right side of the upper lip and the other on the left, distinguishing them by their darkness.
And similarly, there are grooves that are thin and black around them. Cut them with a slightly jagged cut; if they confuse you or you're unsure about their nature, make the larger cut and explain it to yourself. Likewise, do this in the two grooves located on the lower lip.
And as for the two grooves beneath the tongue, their use is to separate them after separating the cheekbones due to the bumps that occur in the throat from diseases of scrofula and mouth illnesses. The method is to place the ill person between your hands with the sandal's sole under his feet, lift his tongue, and look beneath his tongue on both sides for each groove, observing their color until they appear black.
You should separate these two and remember not to overly focus on cutting them, for there are veins beneath them that might cause bleeding from those veins. As for the three grooves found in the armpit, they are the ones traditionally cut in all people, and their separation is done on both sides.
Either by pressing a broad or olive pincer to the wound, or by cutting with a small knife, this is known as "shank" [and here is its image], an image of the broad olive pincer.
It should be wide as you see, suitable for widening the contracted and swollen grooves full of prominent, thick blood like that found in diseases such as scrofula. This is an image of the olive pincer:
This incision is narrower in width and has finer edges, suitable for splitting the delicate tubular blood vessels. This is a depiction of the incising instrument, the 'nshield'.
This is the 'nshield', a tool appropriate for making cuts, with various types depending on the size of the blood vessels; it can be narrow or wide. This serves as a guide to others, and among craftsmen, its use is well known.
As for the basale, one of these three veins, its utility in splitting is that it draws blood from conditions below the neck and around the collarbone, which extends to the chest and abdomen. When pricking this vein during an operation, it's important that the surgeon be cautious and aware; if there is a vessel beneath it, should he make any mistake and add to the incision of the instrument, it might result in cutting through that artery.
A bleed occurs, thus it is preferable not to use a needle for the incision of basale, but rather make an incision using a 'nshield'. If basale does not visibly appear, it should be avoided and replaced with another option or one could seek advice from some practitioners.
Or if you wish to cut near the shoulder, it is clear and can be cut with an incising tool like a 'nshield' as we have mentioned. If you want to perform that specific incision, before pulling on the arm, you should determine the location until you identify the pulse point, then learn it by touching (with a finger or a sphygmomanometer).
Then, the arm is tied and a cut made in it with an incising tool like a 'nshield', as we have mentioned. It's important to aim your strike away from where the artery lies. When you pull on the bandage and notice inflation at the location you learned through palpation, this inflation indicates that there's arterial pulsating there; thus avoid it.
If I see the blood at the incision site being discharged like a child's urine and it is thin, red in color, then you should know that this is from arterial blood. In such cases, immediately act by placing your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger; if the blood flow ceases significantly, it often does cease; hence, you must strengthen your arm.
Leave him, warn the patient against neglecting it and make it a permanent part of his routine until he fully recovers. Do not move or disturb it for days. If the blood flow doesn't stop after your operation and does not bother you during your time with the patient, ligate the artery if it becomes visible; its ends will constrict and the blood flow will cease.
Or take a pork skin, cut it and take half of it. Tie it tightly on the place of discharge with cords and aids until another day. If the blood flow stops or else use what was mentioned before about placing tight stopping points for bleeding and cutting his blood supply is not difficult in most cases.
If the size of the wound is small and you can secure the bandage on your arm, inform him. As for black discharge, it's beneficial that it be wiped away since it draws blood from the top of the head and lower body to this place because it consists of a branch of basilic vein and a branch of cephalic as we said.
It is necessary for the surgeon to be aware of his incision site being on the neck from where he cut. There is a nerve beneath it; if he increases in stitching and hits this nerve, a numbness occurs that is difficult to see, and perhaps it never completely heals. This nerve often appears clearly through touch.
If it is hidden in some people and thin that it cannot be seen, you should make your incision as a slit with the shackle tool while avoiding hitting the nerve. If the discharge is between two nerves, cut it lengthwise. As for cephalic discharge, it's beneficial to wipe it since it draws blood from the head.
It heals eye diseases and it is particularly necessary for this race if you wish to elaborate on it; 'elaboration' includes an insertion with the olive forceps or the broad horseradish forceps, as all races are safer because there is no artery nor nerve under them.
However, when you are cutting, you should avoid using the forceps on just the head of the muscle and seek a soft position; it will not harm him if he is struck in the first blow and needs to be cut several times, as some people may swell if it isn't cut in the first strike.
But this tumor does not harm him in any way. As for the method of cutting and its consequences, as well as what should progress in its repair, the first thing you need to understand is that cutting should only be used for maintaining health alone.
Alternatively, cutting can be used in diseases. In maintaining health and ensuring its continuity, preventing disease occurrence, cutting should be done in one of the three veins located in the arm - those being the cephalic vein, basilic vein, and ulnar veins - and it should occur during the first stage of the spring if there are signs of congestion.
Cutting should be performed on Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of the day have passed. As for the cutting used in diseases, it doesn't have a limited time but can be done at night or day when necessity demands.
In every hour, at any time; it is not advisable to cut boys until they reach fourteen years old and not to cut those who have surpassed sixty years of age. If anyone tries to force cutting for any reason.
It is necessary to cleanse his stomach before cutting with a gentle enema if there is much stagnant waste, so that it doesn't become trapped in the veins during cutting causing an unpleasant infection that harms major organs. Cutting should not be done for those who are bloated, suffer from diabetes, or have indigestion until these conditions subside.
Also, caution bleeding after sexual intercourse and vomiting, diarrhea, and over-fornication, as well as fatigue, sports, night-wakefulness, fasting, and anything that weakens physical or mental strength. Then, examine the mixing of body fluids beforehand if the blood is thick.
By food, drink, and medicines if possible. Then he should take a bath unless prevented by something or engage in some exercise to improve the circulation and ensure that his bleeding takes place during the day as we said. He also aims to spare his chest from all bad psychological symptoms during this day.
Like worries, anger, fear, and all other physical symptoms such as fatigue, excessive dizziness, sex, etc., he avoids them. He prepares his things based on the habits of people using various pleasant scents, fresh airs, pastimes, and so forth according to what each person can manage.
Then the surgeon sits on a cushion which is higher than the one the patient will be lying on. The surgeon then extends his arm and the surgeon operates on it with his hand for two or three times, then tightens the bandage by pulling its ends up to two or three times, making sure that the pull is moderate.
Because if the pull is not moderate, either due to excessive pulling which prevents blood flow or because of over-relaxation which also stops blood flow. After the pulling, it should be necessary for the surgeon to rub all the parts with both hands onto each other.
Until the veins expand and are felt by touch. Then, the surgeon rubs the patient's underparts with old oil. Afterward, he places his little finger of his left hand on the same vein slightly beneath where he intends to bleed, to avoid having the vein shift and thus avoid a strike. Because there are veins that you find like the urethra which seek refuge in stricture, and some of them are filled with gas. Whenever a clamp is placed upon it, it goes down below the clamp, deceiving the stricture, and does not open through the clamp's mouth. If it does open, its opening would be narrow.
For this reason, the stricture must be carefully positioned and mindful of all these matters, then the clamp should be lowered. If the vein opens on its second attempt after being clamped, and if it doesn't, he can repeat the process a little below or above that place with the wheel if the location doesn't swell.
If the patient swells or feels pain, leave him for a day or two and don't tighten the bandage. It might have caused a heat-filled item that doesn't allow bathing, then the stricture will return if he desires it. If the clamp is inserted and the opening is small, and there is a thin flow of blood.
And I feared that not enough blood might come out as you desire, so reposition the clamp in the same hole itself, smooth it to be straight and slightly increase the opening. Do this with the wheel before the area swells, because many people have seen their area swell when there's a small opening.
If you see that it has swollen, don't cut it immediately as it won't help anything. Instead, place something from the edge of oil on it. It makes the flow of blood easier and is better in this location than the oil itself and other ointments.
Use oil from the edge of the stricture for all strictures when there is no flow of blood. And this can be done by applying it to the area with warm water or vinegar, if one applies it, the blood will soften and dissolve if it's thick.
If a large tumor occurs in the place of amputation, it happens frequently, especially to those who have not undergone proper cleaning only this time or had a small incision in the wound. In that case, one should immediately apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water to the tumor and hold it for an hour; it will dissolve.
It should be done after the blood has fully drained out from the wound itself or another one. If something remains in the location for days, it is not harmful and if you wish, you may apply a little patience mixed with dissolved camphor.
Or some cucumber juice or something similar. Often, a tumor and nodule occur at the amputation of the big toe. Place your hand on it; if you find that it softens upon rubbing, then this is bad news. Be cautious not to apply anything like what we mentioned.
It might bleed from a blood vessel, but bind it with something that can hold and harden the place so that it heals properly. Then treat it with other remedies until it recovers. It is necessary to drain out for every person the amount of blood according to their strength and what predominates in the color of the blood.
If the blood is black, let it drain until it turns red. Likewise, if you see that it's thick, encourage its release until it thins out, and if it appears sharp or intense, allow that intensity to fade away. It is necessary for someone who feels full of strength and requires a single discharge of blood to do so.
Ensure that the amputation of the wound is wide and spacious. Conversely, if one is weak, it should be the opposite - tight and narrow. It is advisable to let out the discharge in several stages, with a small opening. The best way to do this for a surgical cut is to have a slit-like incision without any jagged edges.
This method of laceration is precise in bleeding and nerve cutting; it's named Ahmed and Aslam, being superior to the longitudinal and lateral incision. One who tends to this during the process of suturing should be fed something soaked in water from tamarind or orange juice before suturing.
If he has been bleeding for three or four times, and if his temperament is cool, let him have before the operation bread soaked in water from the watermelon juice or honeyed drink, or good mint tea.
If the surgeon experiences giddiness during suturing and if the cause is excessive bleeding, it may be necessary to drink meat water and mint tea. Gentle massage with lavender oil should be used, massaging his chest with it, and all other measures we mentioned in the section on giddiness should also be applied.
The one who experiences urination, and if someone wishes to relieve their arm of excess blood flow again, it is necessary for the person performing surgery when there has been significant blood loss and low strength to slightly release blood gradually with each passing day according to his strength.
As for the one who wishes to relieve their arm and release more blood again, if their body is strong, they can do this seven or nine hours after their first operation. As for those who wish to draw blood from their body in the opposite direction than where it was flowing, it may be necessary for them to rest on the second or third day.
As for the one who has a lot of blood in their body that has heated and become agitated, causing fever, it may be necessary to remove all the blood at once from them and remove a large amount. Expand the opening until the surgeon is satisfied with all conditions for suturing after closely observing. And place your hand on his pulse with the flow of blood to prevent death in place of amputation, this often happens when the surgeon is inexperienced and there's negligence. It is not advisable if you want to remove the arm again for blood release.
And the sweat's mouth has closed, making it difficult for blood to escape. If you apply force or pressure heavily on him, that is very bad. Either let it be until it opens again, or use the edge of the scalpel against the凝olidated blood in the sweat's mouth.
Or, you could apply something that has dissolved in water like salt or something from the sharp vinegar or shaxznaia and gently press on him until blood comes out. If the sweat is swollen, leave it.
Do not touch him until the swelling subsides. If necessity requires blood release again, it cannot be avoided. Either you will open it above this place or in another arm or sweat.
And when opening an arm ligature, if aorta or vena cava are not found or are hidden as they are composed of both. The way to do it is for the physician to immerse his hand in hot water until the probe turns red and sweat appears visibly on the skin. Then apply a moderate tension with the ligature above him.
Then open the sweat slightly, neither too wide nor too long. The opening should be broad and have your incision above the wrist joint a little bit. If blood doesn't come out, put your hand back in the hot water bowl again, let the blood flow in the water.
Until you meet your need, even if it's in summer days, you may not have to put your hand back into the hot water again. The hot water makes blood flow more efficiently especially during winter months. Opening this sweat duct is safer than any other. Because there is no harmful sweat gland or nerve below it, and as for the extraction of bile from the right hand it is beneficial due to the liver conditions and how you should pull the wrist with the bracelet or with your hand after entering it into hot water until the sweat swells.
Because there is no harmful sweat gland or nerve below it, and as for the extraction of bile from the right hand it is beneficial due to the liver conditions and how you should pull the wrist with the bracelet or with your hand after entering it into hot water until the sweat swells. It is truly observable, then it gets detailed slightly and if you cut it completely in all directions, it will not harm him. Don't keep your hand focused on the clamp because there is a nerve under it and the area is exposed from the flesh. Then bring the hand back to the hot water.
Let the blood flow in it. If you do not keep it warm in hot water, the blood will solidify in the mouth of the wound and prevent flow. Stop bleeding when necessary. Place oil and salt on the wound so that it doesn't heal quickly.
Similarly, you should do the same for every narrow section. As for its advantage of extraction from the left hand, it is beneficial due to the gallbladder conditions. Do it in the removal as you did in the second one. For the removal of the large intestine, its benefit is for diseases in the lower body like those related to reproductive organs.
Retaining urine and kidney diseases, chronic sores on thighs and legs, and similar illnesses, as well as the method of extracting it where he puts his leg in hot water and carries on it massage until the sweat emerges, then tenses above the ankle joint with the sweat being visible towards the thumb.
It spreads on the face of man in many branches, so extract it from the widest branch of its kind or at the heel when it's gathered together; this is better and safer. If you remove it from the face of a man, be cautious about the nerves under it on the face of man.
Make your incision as oblique as if you intend to amputate, but make it in such a way that the scissor is parallel. If blood does not come out, make him walk in hot water and let the blood flow until he finishes, if the surgeon makes a mistake with the incision in the first attempt.
He should make the incision slightly higher; there is no danger from it if he cauterizes as we have said, just like what's done with the other knee. As for women's discharges, their location is as we have described when it comes to the posterior aspect of the lateral side.
The benefit of making the incision for a sciatica, if it's due to hot blood, and how to make it: You should let him take the warm bath and hurry up, then pull his leg from the hip to above the ankle with four fingers of your long delicate glove. He can only be seen doing this.
If it appears, then incise in any situation. Either stay on an oblique cut which is better, or amputate him by cutting, making a single incision. Its location is safe and often very hidden; if you don't find it.
If it doesn't show clearly, then make a cut in some parts which appear on the back of the foot towards the thigh and knee. Protect from nerves and drain out as much blood as you need.
Then apply the tourniquet and place cotton at the site of the cut, then firmly press on the area. He will soon recover.
The sixty-ninth chapter.
In cupping and how to use it.
Cups for cupping can be made of horns, wood, copper, or glass. Cupping is performed in two ways: one involves placing the cup on the skin and suction to draw out blood, while the other does not involve a vacuum.
This excision which must have two edges.
Hammer clamps, which are two pages of the neck from both sides, and the jaw clamp which is under the lower jaw in the mouth. Shoulder clamps, and knuckle clamps on the hoof's joints, wrist clamps, which are in the middle of the arms, leg clamps, and elbow clamps.
Excision involves drawing blood from the sinuses that are spread throughout the flesh. For this reason, it should not weaken like a single removal and it is inappropriate to use excision with or without fire in any disease caused by accumulation so that the body can completely evacuate itself.
If necessity calls for excision due to illness or custom, we use it at any time in the first and last days of the month, in the middle of the month, and at any given time.
And there are people who, due to an excess of blood, need to remove it through excision and find heaviness in their head along with headache. Among them are those who find a sensation of fullness and redness on their face, head, and neck. There are others who experience itchiness on their face and under the chin, darkness and dirt in their eyes, and spots where the clamp would be applied.
And among them are those who laugh excessively, and there are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth, foam from their tongue, and spitting out blood. There are others who have excessive sleep, and some see during their sleep blood, redness, wounds, and other such things whenever we observe any of these signs.
And especially, if it's the middle third of the month, we used to perform bloodletting at that time after two or three hours have passed since noon. The advantage of bleeding at the nape is that it relieves heaviness in the head and water that accumulates towards the eyes.
But it should be done after exhausting the body's whole, and this bloodletting could replace the removal of impurities. And caution is advised not to use it for those with cold blood or who have a fever; otherwise, it can severely harm them.
Therefore, the elderly should not use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in their head; they may develop forgetfulness due to its overuse.
Therefore, it is advisable for the person performing bloodletting to lower his hand slightly below during the process in fear of causing forgetfulness. As for pharyngeal bloodletting, it substitutes for removing the tonsils and the Bartholin's glands.
Thus, pharyngeal bloodletting helps with asthma, constriction of breath, chest pain, coughing, and congestion. It is recommended to perform the bloodletting for the back of the throat slightly upward, because if it goes down, it might weaken the heart and the stomach.
And as for the bloodletting of the eyelids, it helps with severe headaches in the head, dampness, dizziness, choking sensation at the roots of teeth and gum inflammation. It also substitutes for removing the Bartholin's glands. It is advised that the person performing bloodletting does not deepen their hand too much to avoid cutting a blood vessel and causing excessive bleeding.
And as for bloodletting under the jaw, it helps with cavities in the mouth and gum diseases and similar illnesses that occur in the mouth. It can replace removing the tonsils which is done on the cheeks. As for back of neck bloodletting, it helps with pleurisy caused by congestion and heat.
And regarding cutting the stomach of the double hump, it is beneficial for what benefits; closing the three basi-lenticular, intercalary and calvarial arteries because it attracts blood from all those small ducts present in the flesh and attracts these small ducts from a further thicker group of them until the attraction reaches the three major arteries.
It is necessary that you command the surgeon not to focus on the condition because it is bare of flesh and under it nerves and arteries. As for the one who performs circumcision, she benefits from those affected by diarrhea and lower lesions.
It is necessary that you command the surgeon to have a large scissors and make it out of brass, because this area needs a strong cut; perhaps glass scissors might break and require many conditions. As for knee surgeons, there will be a noticeable lack in their completeness.
Because it attracts blood from the entire body and relieves chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, bladder, stimulates urination, relieves pimples and boils, replaces tying the tubes and testicles, except that it drains the body heavily and causes impotence in most people. The scissors for the epididymes have a benefit close to the benefit of the leg scissors.
The method of applying the scissors is that you first place the scissor empty and soak it moderately with a scissor. Don't extend the time for placing the scissors, but put it quickly and remove it quickly to allow mixing towards the area in an even anticipation until you see the area turn red and open.
When the blood turns red, then you should cut and use the scissor slowly, then you look at the body's condition. If a person has tender flesh with open pores, it is necessary to cut him once only, so that the area does not become irritated.
The text instructs the surgeon to slightly widen and deepen the cut, and delicately adjust the incision with mild movement. If the blood is thick, it should be cut twice; however, in the first cut, open a pathway for the flow of blood and water. In the second cut, strive to expel the thick, boiling blood.
If the blood is extremely thick, he repeats the cut a third time to achieve the desired outcome. In general, if we wish to extract a small amount of blood, one cut suffices; but if we want to remove much blood, we make several cuts. And if we consider the blood to be boiling or thick, then accordingly the number of cuts would vary.
It may be necessary to make a deep incision, and the moderate depth of the cut only goes into the skin. One should not use any waxes when placing ligatures or in water, nor should one be cautious about the surgeon who performs the procedure. However, for those with thick, hard, rough skin and tight pores.
It may be necessary to apply opening, grinding, and cleansing oils to the areas where ligatures are placed. However, during summer time, you can use oils like almond oil, tangerine oil, sweet walnut oil or sesame seed oil.
And if it's winter, then use oils like narcissus oil, carob oil, chamomile oil, or ginger and so on. If the impurity is thick and cold, then the oil should be turpentine oil, camphor oil, balm oil, or spittle and similar ones.
If the person who performs the procedure has wide pores, it is advisable to avoid oiling him/her. Those with much blood moisture should wash their ligature sites after bleeding with rose water or cold water, or grape juice water or cucumber water and similar substances.
He should wash his parts with vinegar or with the water of as-saq and samaq, or similar. As for those whose hairiness is thick, he should wash their parts with old wine or with the water of murrizanjoosh, or broth of black snake herb or bibling, or similar. It is advisable to beware of bleeding in the bathhouse and shortly after bathing.
It should be used one or two hours after leaving the bathhouse, and no one should sleep immediately after bleeding. It is not appropriate for the person who has bled and the surgeon to engage in any activities before and after the bleeding procedure.
You should first check if the person who has bled or the surgeon is a scrofulous, with their blood being characterized by high fever and inflammation. In this case, it would be advisable for them to take cooling remedies such as rose water, mint leaves, cucumber juice, gooseberry, coriander, etc., and make their food consist of soups made from sheep meat and rabbit meat and similar items.
And if his disposition is cold, it may be necessary to give him a drink of honey water or the drink of myrrh or the gooseberry juice. He should consume medium-priced aromatic wine that lies between old and modern ones. He is instructed to limit his food intake and make his food soups made from birds, quails, and hens' eggs. It would be good for him to have more drink than food during bleeding and fasting days.
It may be necessary in some cases for certain people to drink the strong vinegar or use musk medicine or shilatha before bleeding and fasting, either before or after it, to strengthen major organs and purify blood. It is not advisable for those who have been bled.
As for the non-bleeding individuals, these are those placed on the liver, gallbladder, breasts, abdomen, throat, kidney area, and hip. These organs cannot bear puncturing; rather, they are meant either to draw blood from one organ to another.
The application of the fumigator on the breasts for the purpose of drying or using it to relieve a painful member with cold air that caused harm, similarly when we apply the fumigator on the abdomen and groin, it disturbs the member, warms it up, and alleviates pain through this cool breeze.
And it can be placed on the kidneys if there is a blockage or stone inside; by its strength, maybe the blockage was opened or the stone was removed from its place. Similarly, when applied to the liver and gallbladder under a confusing breeze in them, these fumigators can be used empty with just sulfur.
And it can be used with fire, or filled with steaming water for purposes of purification. So the fumigator is filled with a large amount of hot water alone or with water that has been cooked in some herbs suitable for this purpose.
Then it is placed filled on the area, held for a while and then removed. This process can be repeated according to need. This is how the fumigator used with fire looks like:".
It has two open fingers at its mouth, as depicted. Its depth is about half a foot. In one of its sides, near the middle of it, there's a small hole about the size that an iron needle can enter. It is made from Chinese or yellow brass with thick edges.
It is smoothly flat to prevent it from harming the body when placed upon it. In its center, there's a copper or iron obstruction where the candle is put on fire. This fumigator can be made large than what we described and smaller according to the diseases.
We will use this; the fumigators for boys and young women are not for men or adult males. As for how to place this fumigator on fire in the body, you light a thread wick or a small candle made of beeswax, then put it on the hardened rod in the center of the fumigator.
To have the heat of the fire rise upwards towards the excision site to prevent burning of the deceased's body, then place it on the limb and finger over the hole we mentioned until with the excision we do not need to remove the finger.
The steam escaped through that hole and the cautery stuck to the place, then a wick was placed on the surface and reheated if needed. As for the cautery used in the illness of scabies with water, it does not have a solid rod or a hole.
Only use it by filling it with water and placing it directly on the limb, this is how it looks:
This cautery, the larger it was to hold much water, the better it would be.
The seventy-ninth chapter of the seventh section.
In commenting on congestion.
Congestion is only used in most cases in organs where cauterization cannot be performed, either due to their small size like the mouth and gum tissues and such, or because the organ is uncovered by tissue like the finger and nose and similar parts.
And how to use it is that the one made from pure, water-free of infections should be left in fresh water for a day and night until it decays, so there's nothing left inside it. First, the body is evacuated either through bleeding or incision. Then, the excised limb is treated.
Until it reddens, then it is applied on the limb. If it fills up after that, it's removed, and if cauterization of the site is possible, it benefits more; otherwise, rinse the area with vinegar then with plenty of water and clean it thoroughly. If bleeding persisted even after removing the grease and it turned out to be a pus-filled abscess, then dab some cotton in cold water.
Place it from above until the discharge stops, if there is much blood then dust it with powdered herbs or garlic or something similar until the bleeding stops or place on the spot half a raw and peeled onion.
Leave it until the garlic sticks in place, then the blood will stop. If you need to repeat this process again do not hang that garlic if another option is possible, but if the garlic fails to stick, then clean the area with a thin layer of blood.
Or, you can insert a needle in the spot until some blood comes out then leave it. If she feels something of blood, it sticks to the place. If you want to remove it, throw something like honey or salt or ashes on it, as she will fall off from that spot.
The Third Chapter.
In Algebra.
This chapter is also useful in the field of medicine, which involves the algebra of fractions and the resolution of fractures.
Know, my children, that this chapter may be claimed by the ignorant among doctors and laymen, those who have never flipped through an old book on it or read a single word from it.
And for this reason, this art of knowledge in our country has become extinct. I have never come across anyone who truly understands it thoroughly. But what I have derived from it is what I've obtained through my long reading of the early books and my insistence on understanding them, until I was able to extract knowledge from them. Then, I applied theory to practice throughout my life.
And in this chapter, I have outlined for you everything that encompasses my knowledge on the subject. My experience progressed after presenting it to you, freeing it from the excesses of elongation, reducing it to its ultimate brevity and clarifying it to its utmost elucidation. I have depicted many images of the machines used in it for you within it.
This is an increase in elucidation as I did in the preceding two chapters, and there is no power except with God the Almighty.
The first chapter.
In the first section, one must omit compilations of the matter concerning breaking bones and it's necessary to present them. Before we start mentioning bone fractures and dislocations separately, it is advisable to mention a few introductory remarks and parts within this chapter. It first forces you to understand them and grasp their essence, both you, the eager learner of this noble profession, and those who are not as keen on learning it.
I would say that if anyone experiences a fracture, dislocation, displacement or fall, the first thing you should do is quickly set it, reduce it or both. If prevented by something like weakness of strength, if the affected person is a child or an elderly one, both men and women, or if time brings extreme heat or cold.
He then restricts his diet to cold pulses, bird meat, and juices. He avoids drinking water and thick meats, any food that fills the veins with blood until a tumor is stabilized and you don't expect substances to accumulate in its place.
And at that point, the patient should return to his original treatment as he usually does. When the broken bone is set in position, it's necessary for the patient to consume foods that are heavy and sticky like lentils, rice, beans, peas, and the head of cattle. And the yolk and oily fish, and dense drink, and similar things. In this manner, the healing of fractures occurs more quickly and efficiently; know that broken bones in elderly men never actually reconnect to their original condition.
And to dry their bones, because of their hardness. Connections and fusions can occur with the most delicate of bones like those of young children. However, nature grows over a broken bone from all directions as if it were resin. It is sticky and binds everything together until they stick to each other.
And it binds everything together until it reaches the same strength and reliability as before, so nothing hinders his actions.
For this reason, the food for patients should include foods that are strong, sticky and tough as we mentioned, and be aware that fractures can vary in type according to the different body parts since a fracture of the leg bone is opposed to a head bone fracture, and a fracture of the chest bone is opposed to a back bone fracture.
Likewise, all other body parts are opposed to each other in this way. We will discuss each type of fracture explained separately in its own section, and the type of bone fracture may also vary within itself.
Because it could be a crush fracture without any fragments occurring, and the break could run along the bone with fragments that are clean or dirty. The break can also occur with wounds in the skin, and there's a small compression fracture.
For each type, there is a specific trick in correcting it which will be detailed where appropriate. By this, you can identify bone fractures based on their deformity, stiffness and visibility upon touching them with your hand.
When there is no apparent deformity, no shivering, and no sensation of discomfort at your bone's surface, and when you do not find many causes for pain; in this case, it is not a break but could be either a mild fracture or a soft one, or a slight concussion. It should not be disturbed through pulling or pushing immediately.
But carry him with the medications which will be mentioned later, when they suit the situation. Then gently pull on it. Remember that if a bone breaks and gets compressed by two things without creating fragments, each part would have moved away from its companion.
You should take the initiative to correct and settle him as soon as possible before a hot tumor occurs. If a hot tumor appears, leave it for days until the hot tumor subsides, then adjust him in any way you can using kindness and cleverness.
And remember, correcting and settling a whole bone is easier than one that has fragments. Then pull on what will be mentioned next. If the bone contains fragments, there must be elongation of the broken limb from both sides, whether with hands or legs.
Either use your hands if the limb is small, or use two ropes, or a combination of both, and have the limb placed on a flat surface in its natural shape. Until the broken part of the bone extends slightly; then, push those excesses back into their places using all the cleverness and kindness you can apply.
And make sure in your efforts that you do not cause pain or discomfort due to your actions on the injured parts. Strive to hold one bone together with its companion using the best technique possible. At this time, it's advisable to touch and feel them with your hand. If you notice anything different, correct and adjust them as far as your capability allows.
Exerting extreme pressure and using strong squeezing, as many fools do, they often talk about their actions in this manner - throwing a hot object or for an extended period of time on the body member. I have seen them repeat these actions multiple times.
Then after achieving harmony, mastery, and tension in the adjustment process, it is necessary to ensure rest and gentle stimulation of that organ. He should be cautious not to move it during his wakefulness and sleep, when he is turned over and experiencing discomfort or when using the toilet and during all its movements. The extent of its movement exceeds normal limits. He must seek to find out whether the position in which the organ resides provides a place where pain can be avoided.
And that is because if the person feels pain or discomfort in the position of his organ, he should move it to a different position where there is no sensation of pain. And he should ensure that this new position is level and straight.
So that there are no deformities in the body if it is forced into position. As for how to pull on a broken member, it's as I describe to you: know that broken members vary by size and shape, so what makes them smaller like an arm, finger, or similar.
The ligatures should be tight but smooth, not rough like the thigh, back, and chest. The ligatures should be broad to fit the larger body parts firmly from all sides with equal tension without causing discomfort.
Then, after you have completed your adjustment, you begin to bear the appropriate plaster. With gentle force at the breakage site, you then start wrapping the bandage around that very spot three times or four times according to what the part deserves. You gently pull on the bandage and then move it up towards the top of the breakage site.
Tighten slightly less than the tension required for the broken place, then spread by rolling away from the fracture site a little bit and relax the tension gradually until it takes a correct position that is fit. Then take another bandage and also wrap it around the broken place.
Wraps then go to the bottom side of the fracture, and your action in tightening and relaxing the wrapping should be as described when we spoke about tightening the upper first one. Then place between the layers of bandage some soft pressure or indentations according to how it conforms to the contour of the fracture.
If there are irregularities, do not put anything on them. Then wrap it with another bandage, and stabilize this wrapping using the tightness of your hand if there is no inflation or hot tumor in the body part.
If there is inflation or a hot tumor, carry it with something that settles the tumor and removes the inflation. Leave it for days, then tighten the bands on it when you do so. The bands can be made of half reed stalks finely engraved and well worked according to wisdom, or they can be made of wood from water wheels.
These are made from cedar, palm fronds, bamboo strips or reeds and similar items that have been prepared for this purpose. Each band should be of the same size and shape.
Other than the band placed on the fracture itself, which should be slightly wider and thicker than the other bands. As for the length of the band, it is made according to what suits the size of the broken limb, as follows: the shape of the band:.
Then, tighten the bands with another bandage just as you did with your first tightening. After that, secure it from above using tight threads according to what we have mentioned regarding tension, which should be stronger at the site of the fracture. The more distance from the fracture, the lesser the tension.
It is necessary for the threads to be medium in thickness and softness. They should be made of wet camel wool, especially because if the threads are as hard as what I saw done by the ignorant people, they make them out of braided camel wool strands, which is a great mistake.
Because it causes excessive tension with them, and the softer threads are also not suitable because you cannot achieve the level of tension that you want. It is also not appropriate for there to be less than a finger's width between the stitches.
If injury occurs to the patient at the ends of the bones after tension in the right places, make a soft strain or spreading under it until it does not hurt him in any way. And if there is a fracture with an open wound and a skin tear occurs, we will discuss that separately.
And know that not every broken member should be bound with stitches from the first day. This is because if the member is large, it should not be bound with stitches until five days or seven or more have passed, depending on how you are concerned about the occurrence of heat tumors.
And this is the quality of the bandages that were forced onto the first ones placed on fractures, breaks and sutures. This is a simple homemade bandage that forces the fracture and is suitable for most fluids, especially children and women because it does not get hot nor cold.
It is to take the dust of the millstone, which is a part of the dura that sticks to the walls of the mill when the mill is in motion. You should mix it as it is without washing it with egg white and make the mixture neither too thick nor too thin before using it.
Description of another dressing that forces fracture, dislocation and reabsorption, it is taken from the donkey, the oxen, the sheep, goats, cows, camels, and from each one eleven dirhams with interest and patience for each one five dirhams, from ostriches twenty dirhams, and from Armenian or Roman clay twenty dirhams. Everyone pierces and mixes it with water from ostrich or with the white of an egg if the deceased's disposition is released, then this dressing is used. It has good composition; it breaks the broken bones quickly and suits most people due to its moderation.
Description of another dressing that also helps in fracture and reabsorption, it is taken from the sand and the white dust from each one eleven dirhams with interest and four dirhams for each one five dirhams sheep. It takes twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Everyone pierces it smoothly, sifts it and kneads it with water or egg white, then uses it.
Description of a dressing for joints and bones removed from their places, it soothes the acute pain in them and reduces bone irritation and fracture. It takes treated wool which is immersed in vinegar and cooked oil and placed on the site. This dressing does not contain any force of breaking.
But it is excellent in soothing the hot swelling and relieving pain, particularly. Description of another dressing that breaks the broken bones, it takes the paper of the deaf grape leaves and the paper of the wild borage, pierces them all together, binds them with these two moistly. Description of a shorter dressing used when there's immediate need for breaking bone.
And you want to analyze the rest of the tumor, take from the ostrich feather and the borage plant, its root and half a part of honey. Everyone pierces it and mixes it with paint if the body is not bloated; if it's bloated, mix it with vinegar water or plain water and use it.
Description of a later dressing that is even stronger in analysis compared to the first one, used when a solid tumor occurs during bone growth. It is taken from the root of the fenugreek, with the seed of tamarind and almond, the crown of king, coriander leaves, and from each of saffron and ginger an amount of half.
Everyone beats and kneads it with dirty water or pure water, or with paint as per the body's heat and rest of its temperature. As for Galen, he didn't mention in his book that you should apply to a broken limb when setting it.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil alone, it should be of a medium consistency between hardness and softness. As for Galen, he believed that when setting a broken limb, things containing dryness along with something hot like vinegar and patience and milk and what we've mentioned should be used on the affected area.
Description of a poultice that helps with weakness and pain, it is made from thyme, fennel seeds or bird feathers' down, and fenugreek leaves. It should be finely ground, sifted and kneaded to apply. The amount that should remain on the bandage as required.
Then, it heals. So you should look: if there is no swelling or pain and the broken bone doesn't move from its place, then do not wait many days for healing; because if it happens in this spot a severe cracking pain or unbearable pain or expansion.
Act immediately to heal it, don't delay this at all and remove the dressing. Then take a soft cloth or a sea sponge soaked in warm water, wash the area with it until the itching subsides and pain is relieved. Let the limb rest for an hour afterwards.
Then it is covered with treated cotton soaked in vinegar, oil or rose oil, and tied to him overnight to relieve the hot tumor, calm the organ's inflation, alleviate its pain. Then it is reattached to gentle traction and slight dressing without applying force in your first attempt.
And continue to treat him until he is cured. If I observe that the tumor, redness, pain, inflation and all symptoms have completely disappeared and the need for dressing and traction arises again, prepare as you did initially. If no condition as mentioned has occurred within the organ, then do it accordingly.
Do not heal him except after three, four, five or seven days; sometimes it may leave twenty days, all this depends on what you observe about the condition of the organ as we said, even if it necessitates breaking and allows for healing.
Furthermore, increase the traction more than your first one completely. Also, increase the thickness of the dressing according to what was previously mentioned. If you observe that the fracture site has dried and softened more than it should, know that food cannot reach there.
Let it be rinsed with lukewarm water every time he is treated, and let this happen every three days. Slightly reduce the traction; by doing so, food will flow into the organ and heal quickly. As for what the ignorant do when they break the organ again.
If it does not force what should be forced first and forces only pain, then their action is wrong and a great deception. Even if they were correct in stating this earlier in their books, doing so would have been mentioned, and I did not see any effect of this from any one of them clearly. The correct thing is not to operate on it.
Chapter Two.
In the oblique fracture of the head.
The types of oblique fracture in the head are numerous, its shapes are various and its causes are diverse. Some fractures occur due to a sword blow, they may either completely ablate the bone until it reaches the sinus below the bone. Similarly, as is done with carpentry in wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called carpentry, and it may also be that the sword cut some part of the bone and just its edge without penetrating to the end of the cut. This type of fracture is called a partial penetration injury, and the wound from these fractures can either be large or small.
There are fractures that are brittle or soft, their cause being a blow with a stone or falling onto a rock or something similar. This type of fracture can either puncture close to the membrane underneath the bone, or it may be located in the face of the bone.
The wounds from these fractures can also either be large or small. There are also fractures that occur internally in the bone within the hair follicles, which is a gradual expansion.
This type of fracture is therefore called hairily, and there's a type that occurs due to falling or hitting with a stone, etc., where the bone page enters inside and makes the place indented, as it shows like copper when hit in such a way that part of it goes inside.
And it mostly occurs in the wet bones of the head, such as those of children's heads. All these types of fractures can have clean and unclean fragments. We will provide treatment for all of that in its respective section, and we will identify all these types of fractures through examining them.
Inspecting it with scalpels and removing the rotten flesh from it. In case of hair-borne infection, one should expose the bone, clean it and paint it using a medicated paste; if the fracture is revealed to be black, then you first observe the symptoms of impurity in order to treat it.
If I see symptoms that clearly indicate fear, such as retching bile, protraction, loss of mental function, cessation of speech, seizures and high fever, reddening and swelling of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach or treat him. Death often occurs in most cases when these symptoms are present without exception.
And if I see symptoms that are not alarming and I hope for his safety, then you should begin to treat him. The reason being, if the injured person was hit at the very beginning of their injury when it was in winter days.
It is necessary to make an effort in removing the bone before the fourteenth day under any circumstances, and if it's during summer days, it would be advisable to quickly remove the bone before the seventh day so as not to spoil what is beneath the bone from the tissue. These symptoms that we described should then appear.
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and was accompanied by a break and looseness, it would be necessary to cut off the diseased and fractured part as I have described for you, which involves shaving the head of the injured person.
Exposing the bone in any way that is possible for you, according to the shape of the wound and what appears on the injured person. If there is bleeding or a hot tumor upon examination of the bone, respond with what is appropriate in that case.
It involves filling the area with a puncture soaked in wine, oil, and honey to calm the tumor and stop bleeding. Then you should proceed with repairing or removing the bone, which can be done through two methods of work.
And this is the first case, which involves cutting bone with a thin, fine blade, and here is how it looks:
Then, another incision is made after this one, slightly away from it, and here is its depiction:
Also, another incision is used after the second one, and it should be slightly further apart from the second cut. It's necessary to have several different cuts where some are farther than others, or some are shorter than others. They should be extremely sharp at their edges. These can be made of Indian iron or good quality steel.
And when you hit the incision, use caution to avoid damaging the head. If the bone is strong and hard, it's necessary to pierce around it before using your cutting tools which they called non-submerged drills. They were not actually submerged, but they referred to them as such.
Because they do not exceed the limit of the skull bone to beyond it, for the drill has a smooth edge below his head resembling a bracelet or small circle preventing it from sinking and surpassing the thickness of the bone.
It is necessary for you to have a large number of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone so that it suits every skull with a pointed edge in its length and shortness according to the thickness of that skull, this is the image of three types. From the drills, large, medium, and small:
And as for the method of piercing around the broken bone, you should place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has penetrated, then move the drill to another location and make sure there is some resistance or roughly that between each incision.
Then cut with segments between each hole, and do so as gently as you can given what your capability allows in terms of carefulness, until you remove the bone either by hand or through something else from some of the tools you have prepared for this.
Like the jugular and superficial lymph nodes, caution should be exercised to prevent contact with the puncture or cut. If the bone swells and detaches from the pericardium if it is adhered together and is removed, it should be cleaned.
And smooth out the roughness of what remains in the bone with another tool similar to a cutting instrument, but it should be finer and smoother than other cutters. If there is some small bones or fragments left, take them gently using your tools.
Then, treat the wound afterwards with ointments and medications mentioned. As for the other side of this work, it is simple and far from ambiguity; Galen mentioned this and praised it greatly. This is what he said. Firstly, you should start by removing a part of the bone from the place where it broke most and hardest. Once this part is exposed, you will place the tip of this lense cutting instrument beneath it. This is how it looks:
The part of the lens-shaped piece is smooth and doesn't cut anything. The sharp part on its sides is at a diagonal to the length, as you can see. The lens-shaped part rests against the pericardium, while the tip of the sharp piece points into the bone. Then you strike the cut on one side.
With a small mallet until you cut all the bone gently as it turns and you are safe from the pericardium where no fearful incident can occur, even if the surgeon is unaware of people's fearfulness and cowardice, yes, even if he is complacent.
If there remains a fragment of the membrane attached to the bone in some locations of the bone, cut it off with the lensed surgical tool itself and remove it gently; it will be removed without harm or fear.
And if the bone fracture did not reach the membrane, and what was broken from the bone was its surface, leaving roughness and pieces that are smooth. It would be advisable to remove this roughness and extract these smooth pieces that have taken various sizes and quantities that you can use in each place depending on what suits it better for work's guidance.
The same broken bone and its shape should be used first in removing the broader strips of bone, then use the finer ones afterwards. Continue doing this with loyalty until you use all its finest and most delicate pieces.
As for the smaller, thread-like fissures and gentle breaks, it would be advisable to treat each one individually with a remedy as what leads to its benefit is something that is clear to those who have the least knowledge in this field and have stopped at what we wrote and explained about large breaks.
If the membrane remains exposed during your bone extraction, it would be advisable to take a catgut thread according to the wound and immerse it in turpentine oil, then place it on the mouth of the wound. Then, take another thread that is bent or triangular. Immerse it in a drink of turpentine oil and place it on the first thread, doing this with as little weight as you can manage so as not to burden the wound. Then use it from above with a broad bandage, only pulling it tight enough to hold the wound.
Allow him this treatment for a day or two until the hot tumor calms down, then remove it and use afterwards any medicines that he possesses. An improvement is recommended such as roots of soapberry, powder from black snail shells, sifted saffron, nutmeg grater and similar substances; you make these into poultices.
Let the wound dry out as it is, in essence, use a medicine that tends to heal rather than soothe. When you treat the wound, ensure it remains clean without grease or dirt; don't let pus accumulate there.
Because pus, if it accumulates on the brain membrane, deteriorates and contaminates it. This can cause a great harm to the patient, especially when the skull is exposed upon removal of bone fragments; this may lead to severe headache too, particularly if proper treatment is neglected.
A black spot on its surface, if you observe it closely, presents the symptoms we mentioned; thus, understand that he is dying without a doubt. Even though the blackness might have appeared due to a medicine applied onto him, and this strength of the medicine could be causing such blackness.
You should take a portion of honey and three portions of rose oil, mix them well together in good mixture, then apply it on the wound with a cloth. Then treat him with various types of treatment until he heals.
The Third Chapter.
Fixing the nose if it breaks.
Understand that the nose breaks only in its upper fissure, either completely or one of them. This is because they are bones; below it is cartilaginous which does not break but instead faces tearing, bending and dislocation.
If one of its stumps breaks, it should be that the smallest finger enters the hole in the nose and you adjust this fracture from inside with your index finger and thumb from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape. Do this gently and make sure that this does not happen to the helpless person and hurt.
If the fracture is in the top of the nose and the finger hasn't joined back, it should be that you adjust with the tip of a hard object. If the fracture is in both sides, do like this, and let him try to set it on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, but otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot tumor has subsided, then enter into the hole of the nose a thread from a needle if the fracture is in one side or enter two threads if the fracture is in both sides.
Let the thread be hard enough to fill the hole of the nose. Some recommend that you smear the thread with tallow and change it every day, but I do not see this as necessary; instead, you should smear the thread with egg white mixed with almond paste.
Then leave the thread until the bone is set and cartilage has dried. You can then insert into the nose, in place of the thread, downy feathers from an owl after wrapping them with a soft cuticle; it will be harder to remove due to the fracture, so as not to prevent the sick person from breathing.
This is not a necessary thing; if you want to make it like this, or if you prefer to use threads, cover the nose with turpentine or cotton dipped in honey and oil. Or something from the Deakhil ointment would work as well.
If a hot lump is not removed, it should be cauterized externally with quicksilver and potassium nitrate. These have been compounded into a paste for that purpose. Then place a soft piece of leather on top without binding the nose to anything at all; if the nasal bone breaks, it will break in small fragments.
If it breaks apart, you should cut open and remove it with a suitable instrument. Then stitch the incision and treat it with things that help heal and cure using ointments compatible for that purpose. If there's an injury inside the nose, it may need puncturing, and one might use lead pipes in treatment. Until it heals.
The Fourth Chapter.
If the lower jaw breaks.
If the lower jaw breaks, if it is broken without a wound, and if only the break occurred externally without splitting into two pieces and being pushed inward, then its identification becomes easier.
If the break is in the right incision, you should enter the left thumb into the upper jaw's mouth. Similarly, if the break is in the left incision, you enter the left thumb with the right hand and gently lift the broken piece from inside to outside.
Your other hand, inside the bone, controls it for realignment. If the jaw has broken into two pieces, you should use a rod on both sides to achieve stability until it can be properly aligned. If tooth decay has occurred, there will be an outbreak.
Or, if it's too spread out, hold whatever you hope will remain in gold thread or silver or copper wire. Then place on the broken jaw a quill that is bent and then set on it a large hard bead or a piece of leather shoe that matches the length of the jaw. Then, it is connected from above according to what you are able and fit for connecting him so that it does not collapse. You instruct the patient in bed rest and silence, making his food into thin dates from Al-Ahsa. If you suspect that he has changed something about the appearance in one of its faces, you proceed with addressing it on the third day.
Then, it is connected from above according to what you are able and fit for connecting him so that it does not collapse. You instruct the patient in bed rest and silence, making his food into thin dates from Al-Ahsa. If you suspect that he has changed something about the appearance in one of its faces, you proceed with addressing it on the third day. Then, you fix what you've built with the dust of the khir (a type of gum) mixed with the white part of an egg or with cornstarch after removing the scurf from him. Place a thin layer on the dressing, if this dressing sticks to him and does not change his bone condition, leave it as it is.
Do not remove it until he recovers and the fracture strengthens significantly. This fracture often hardens within three weeks, so if any hot lump appears during this period, use what we have mentioned repeatedly for stabilizing it until that lump disappears.
As for fractures with wounds, if it has healed from the bone pieces or fragments, gently remove those fragments according to what fits you when using your tool. If the wound's mouth is narrow, widen it with pliers as much as needed.
Then, if you have removed all those fragments and there's nothing left from them, draw the wound's mouth if it's wide. Otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for this. And let the wound heal until it has healed.
The Fifth Chapter.
In forcing the traction if it breaks.
The traction (or instrument used for traction) is more likely to break from the front towards the end of the tibia. If it breaks, it does so on one of three aspects: either it breaks into two pieces without producing fragments, which is easier to correct; or it breaks and splits into two parts with the production of fragments; or else it may break at its center, producing smaller fragments that are more difficult to manage during the correction process.
Either it happens to have fragments during the breakage which is more difficult for reunification, or there's a fracture with an injury. The operation in this case should occur if the breakage isn't from an injury by having two assistants prepare one holding the bone following the broken extremity and the other stretching the neck towards the opposite side.
Then straighten the breakage with your fingers until it takes the required shape without any knots or bruises. If you need to extend more, it is advisable to place under the patient's wrist a ball of sandpaper or wool.
And the size of its bone is according to your need, stretch and lift the broken part until it gets corrected properly. If you can't pull out one end of the broken part due to its deep insertion, the patient should lean on their elbow.
A medium pad is placed under his knees in the bone, and the assistant presses the patient's knee downwards until the broken part which is deeper rises to above. Then, the fracture gets corrected and readjusted with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the bone has broken off and is moving, it should be cut open and that fragment taken out gently. If the fragment is stuck in the bone, try to cut it into sections using one of the cuts that have been made for this purpose. After it becomes under the machine that preserves the wound, which is an apparatus made of wood or iron, and this is its depiction:".
It resembles a spoon without a handle, and its width depends on the size of the bone you need from large to small. As for its length, it is according to how much work you can do, it should have two ends as you see, one end being wider and the other narrower.
If the wound cut during the extraction of a bone fragment is wide and successfully sealed after heat removal, then join the edges of the wound with suturing. If the wound cut is small or if there is fear of residual heat, then incise the wound and provide dressings according to the extent of the cut.
If there is a hot tumor, then apply incision in the oil and honey or wine, or carry it. If it's the displacement of bone without any cut or slash, then you should apply on the bone the padding made from dust of ashes mixed with the whites of eggs. Then, you place a soft cloth on him. If needed, hold the ball under his chest. Then take a long robe that is about a span wide or similar width. Hold a bent stick in between the cloth and padding. Then carry a stone from a thin plank. Its width should be three fingers and the same length. Then insert it into a cut. Then, place this cut together with the stone in the part of the robe that is placed over the fracture site. Then pull the robe on the break as you would spin it. Place it on his neck and under his chest, as well as under the patient's chest. Roll it back and forth on each side as many times as you like until you see that the pull is firmly setting the fracture in place. This is what you should observe yourself.
All these should ensure that the stone doesn't move off the fractured bone. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect the patient every day. If you notice that the ligament relaxes and the stone has moved away, correct this and tighten the ligament again. Then have the patient lie on their back for the night's rest, and place a small pillow under his chest during his nighttime sleep.
Lift the bone from its side, lift the fracture with the height of the knee or attach his arm to his neck. The bandage is not changed if there is no incident of cut or tumor for twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if I see a cause for it. The plaster should be tightened and left until the fracture binds itself, and strengthens more. This usually happens around the eighteenth day. It may happen in some individuals within less than that.
The Sixth Chapter.
Chapter Six: Healing of the Shoulder. If the shoulder breaks at its widest part, only its ends break off, not its main body. When it breaks away from a place or in its middle, this can be identified by touch. Depending on the shape of the break, apply the treatment accordingly.
Adjust and restore it to its natural form in every way you can. Then, dust the affected area with corn flour mixed with raw egg whites and fine sand. Place a camel's hoof pad on top of that, then cover it with a broad bandage made of wood.
Cover the shoulder or a little larger, if it is below the bandage, smooth out this area with fine sand until the bandage settles evenly. Then pull from above with a long gauze.
Tighten firmly until the bandage stays in place, check the bandage every day. If the bandage relaxes, tighten it again and make sure the splint does not move. If the splint moves from its place, it means restlessness of the patient who should lie on their side correctly. The shoulder should strengthen within twenty days.
One day or twenty-one days, if you complete this count, the ligament will resolve and you will be safe. It is from the bones that are not feared by breaking or weakening it. If a fragment protrudes from the bone and begins to shrink under the skin, cut it open and remove it. Perform what I have mentioned in breaking the coagulation from settling of the hot tumor. If something like this happens,.
The Seventh Chapter.
Inforcing a Broken Rib.
The breast may break in its middle and such occurrences are less frequent. However, its ends are more prone to breaking and disintegration. One of its symptoms if it breaks in the middle is that it leans downwards and exposes severe pain and difficulty breathing, along with coughing.
Perhaps, blood might gush out and the shock of the fracture becomes apparent in the broken bone. It can be felt by touch as well. After the fracture, he should lie on his back with the curve between his shoulders forming a trough. Then both knees are bent and the ribs on each side are massaged to help settle them into place whenever possible.
And agree with him until the shape of the bone returns to what it should be, then carry him on a stretcher with weight and place a board or a companion's wooden plank or something similar under him with lightness after wrapping him in strips. Then, take care to bind it properly on the broken bone so that it doesn't come off. Roll the bandage around several times towards the back and tightly pull it. Examine the bandage at all times, and every time you loosen it, tighten it again.
And if necessity demands its solution among those who eat, a wound or a tumor, then proceed with its resolution and remove the dressing. Then fix what was exposed in this manner through its cure method. And return the dressing if I see fit. And on it, and make him hold firmly until he is cleansed.
The Eighth Chapter.
In the case of a spinal fracture, know that fractures occur in the most painful areas located behind and at the ends of the back. These areas are protected by cartilage for this reason. The knowledge of this is not hidden to touch through palpation.
Stabilize it by smoothing the fracture with your fingers on a flat surface until it conforms to what is appropriate, then bandage and apply traction to the broken bone using a splint if needed. If there's an oblique spinal fracture towards inside, it exposes a severe pain.
And let it dry like the one exposed to the user of a hairpin because bones shrink and expose difficulty in breathing, coughing, and abundant bleeding which is hard to treat. Many tricks have transformed its initial stages.
Among them, some say that it is desirable to make the diet of the fasting person generate farts and winds so that the belly inflates and stretches. The fracture moves outwards. We dislike this because it might be mistaken for the confirmation of a hot tumor if it hadn't happened; but if it has, then it will increase and confirm it.
And some say, place it on the affected area inflated then squeeze strongly which is similar to palpation but he fears that the inflated area might be pulled towards the affected area due to his weakness. Others said it's better to cover the area with a cloth dipped in hot oil.
The insertion of reinforcement between the ribs until it fills, then when wrapped around in a rotation, makes the band level. Then treat the patient with malabsorption treatments from food and medication, for an exhausted patient is one who cannot bear much strain. The bone would shrink the diaphragm causing harm and fear for the patient. It is necessary to cut through the position, expose the broken rib, then place an apparatus under it that preserves the thoracic cavity as described and gently cut the bone and remove it.
Then we sew together the wound if it is large with stitches and treat it with ointments until it heals. If there appears a hot lump during this, immediately smear the affected area with poultices and treat the patient from inside as well to calm down the lump.
He should lie on the side that relieves him when sleeping until he heals,
Chapter Nine.
In矫正theback and neck spasms.
If the neck bones are fractured, fortunately such incidents do not happen often and more commonly happens in pregnancy as well as back fractures. If this occurs to someone and you want to know whether they will recover or not. So observe, if you see his hands have relaxed and numbed, they are dead and he cannot move them or spread them or grasp them. If you pinch them or prick them with a needle, he doesn't feel it or doesn't find pain in them. Know that he usually will not recover as he is dead.
If he moves them and feels it with pinching or needle pricking, know that the bone has relaxed and the patient is recovering through treatment. If such back spasms occur like this one and you want to know whether they will recover as well.
Observe his legs; if they have relaxed and the events that occurred in the hands have happened to them, then when he lies on his back, wind and feces come out involuntarily. And when he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily. And if, when lying on his back, he tries to urinate but cannot manage it, know that he is dying. Do not seek his cure as if you were dealing with a living person. If there has been nothing of this sort before, the situation would have been less severe. The treatment for what happened like this should be trying to soothe the hot tumor.
To treat it, apply rose oil alone or with cooked and ground egg yolk on the affected area. Do this three times a day during the daytime until the hot tumor calms down. Then carry on applying one of the cooling absorbent cloths to that spot, hold it there with the bandage, advise him to rest and make decisions calmly.
He should not sleep on the side where he doesn't find any pain until he recovers. If there was a fragment or something that had been removed from inside the bone during a tooth extraction, it would be necessary to cut open the skin and remove that bone piece. Then, if the wound is large, you should stitch up its lips. After that, treat with salt ointments until he recovers. If the last bone of the hamster (the base of the little toe) broke and it makes the hind leg useless, then you should put the thumb of your left hand inside the socket.
Break the broken bone with your other hand according to what you can and fits for setting. Then apply a dressing or bandage if needed, then secure it in place.
If you feel that there is a broken fragment inside, cut it and remove it. Then treat the wound with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals.
The Tenth Section.
In the correction of the fracture of the thigh bone.
If the bones of the buttocks break, if they do break, then their fracture is that they split at their extremities and crack longitudinally, bending towards the inside, it becomes prone to displacement and causes pain in its location, and there will be swelling and numbness in the leg which has undergone the break.
Correction involves passing your hand over it until you stand on the fracture as to how its shape is, if the break occurs only at its extremities, then adjust that break according to what suits your adjustment till it resembles its natural shape.
If the break occurs longitudinally or has inclined towards the inside, then place the limb on its back so that you can adjust this break. When you have adjusted it, put padding under it and then place a splint of wood or leather over it and tighten it firmly.
Don't fear the movement of the break or removal of the splint, adjust the tension from the braces with what fills them until it takes hold under the pressure. Command the patient to sleep on their back or on their correct side, if he exhibits a hot tumor.
Release the tension and correct until the hot tumor subsides, carry him on what he is accustomed to as before, then return to correction and tightening as it should be. If there are fragments or breaking from its extremities, it shouldn't be removed.
And does not touch but adjusts from the outside as we said, and leaves the tension until it heals.
The Eleventh Section.
In the correction of the fracture of the humerus.
The shoulder is the area between the scapula and the top of the back, if it breaks, set it with two directions one being to take a flexible and smooth splint as shown in this diagram:.
And attach two straps to it, then hang it from a high position. The patient should sit on a chair and his broken arm is placed over the splint until the elbow sticks in the middle of the curvature of the splint. Then something heavy is hung above him.
Or have the servant extend him downwards, then the doctor will fix the break with his hands until it returns as it should. The other way is to make the patient lie on his head and hang his hand from his neck with a strap.
Then command the servants to adjust one above the break with his hands and the other below, extending each of them towards their respective sides. If you want it to be stronger, pull under the break with a strap and above with another, and extend each servant in their direction.
If the break is close to one of the thighs, then the center of the band should be under the elbow and the other under the break towards the scapula. Similarly, if the break is close to the scapula, then the band should be at that place and on the scapula itself.
Then, fix the break gently without violence until the break settles as it should and forms a good union. If there is no fever, tighten it; if there is a fever, leave off tightening until the seventh day, then apply clean cotton wool soaked in vinegar and rub with rose water.
Until the fever subsides, then tighten it. The method of tightening is to place a bandage over the break, then wrap another new clothe around the bandage, and then gather the arm against the shoulder blade itself, placing her hand open on her hip.
Should there be a tear or strain on the shoulder and arm, that the arm may take the place of the clavicles if it is not hindered by something preventing it, and no change occurs in the broken bone, then fear that something will change upon you and do use the clavicles.
And it is to place a clavicle on the fracture itself that is wider and stronger than all other clavicles, and to make between each clavicle an opening for one finger. The length of the clavicles should be according to the fracture with an increase of three fingers from each side.
Then, you pull on the clavicles the strain that I mentioned in the preliminaries of the chapter.
And it is to have your pull on the place of the fracture stronger.
And the less the interval between fractures, if I see placing of clavicles and pulling as we said when you were supporting the limb with your effort during immobilization, then do it.
And if you fear the hot swelling, leave off pulling and clavicles until the seventh day as we said. Then examine the ligament every three days to ensure there is no infection or inflammation or inability for food to reach the limb due to excessive pulling. All this should be done according to what I have mentioned.
And if you are certain that nothing of this will happen, then do not remove the ligament until many days later. Have the patient lie on his back with his hands on his stomach. Place something soft and well-filled under the shoulder to support it.
And check at any time of day or night to ensure the shape of the broken limb does not change and that the ligament is not relaxed. Do all this with your efforts, and provide a diet for the patient as we suggested: it should be mild initially until when bone starts getting stronger.
It is necessary to thicken his diet, for it is customary that the arm and leg harden within forty days. Then, it should be removed and used in baths, treated with ointments suitable for this purpose. If there's any fracture, it must be properly treated.
Do not remove the bandage from him for fifty days or for two months.
The second chapter.
In balancing the break of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called zygapophyses. One is smaller and goes underneath the thumb; the other is larger and rests below it from below. The greater or smaller zygapophysis might break alone or both could break together.
If the upper small zygapophysis breaks, then the arm can be set more easily and is returned to its position faster. If it's the lower one that breaks, the break is worse and harder to return, especially if both zygapophyses break together. If the bone that broke was the upper small zygapophysis.
When setting the arm, the doctor should make the process gentle and gradual until it is properly aligned. If it's the larger zygapophysis that is broken, he should make the procedure more forceful. If both zygapophyses are broken, the strength of the setting should be greatly increased.
When setting the arm, the hand shape should be maintained. The hand should be placed with the palm flat on a cushion and the thumb positioned higher than all other fingers. The wrist should be below the other fingers and the fingers should be spread out straight against each other.
Let the cushion be at his level so he doesn't have to strain himself.
Then the nurse of the arm extends it either from below with his hand or with a bandage, and another nurse extends it from above in the same manner. The surgeon then adjusts the bone until he returns it to its best possible form. If there are fragments in the fracture, they are removed.
Return every fragment to its place. Should you find a clean fragment in the fracture and observe that there is shrinking of the skin but no intention of healing, do not attempt to reunite it; instead cut it open and extract it as we have previously described. If there is a fracture accompanying an injury, I shall provide separate instructions for it.
When treating this, if you experience a hot boil during your first attempt at setting the bone, apply a cut with the iron tool that has been rubbed with rose oil and white beeswax. It should be of medium thickness between thickening and softness, and press firmly on the cut until the lump subsides.
Remove the iron tool and apply a dressing made from powdered rhubarb mixed with egg whites. Then carry out the splinting; ensure that the splint for the fracture is slightly wider but stronger, and know that there will typically be seven splints for an arm.
If the fracture was in one humeral bone or both together, make your grip stronger and more forceful at the site of the fracture. As you lift or lower with your grip, let it tilt a little bit upwards or downwards as described in the first section, following the instructions provided.
Let the cut around the fracture be a moist, loose incision and not too hard. Use a special wool thread for the grip, which should be medium thickness between softness and firmness as we described. Check the limb and bandage after a few days.
If something needs to be fixed, like a cut that occurs in the organ, it should be immersed in hot water until the cut calms down. The organ should not be pulled too tightly overnight so it can rest, then resume pulling again.
If the pulling has relaxed and the bone has disappeared or similarly, fix all this according to your ability, and also check if food is unable to reach the organ due to excessive pulling. In that case, relax it a little for a few days until food starts reaching there, then pull again.
If there is no reason for the delay in what we mentioned, it should not be postponed except after twenty days or around that timeframe. Then suspend the restricted person's hand towards their neck and let their arm hang naturally. They should control their exertion from chaotic movements and sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture of the arm will heal in thirty days or in twenty and three, and perhaps it might heal in eight and a half weeks; all of this depends on the conditions of the climate and strength.
The thirteenth chapter.
In the correction of wrist and finger fractures.
Fingertip and wrist fractures rarely occur, but the fingers are affected frequently. Whenever there is a fracture in the wrist or finger.
It should be that the restricted person sits upright, with a stool in front of him for stability.
Then he places his hand on it extended, then the attendant of the broken bone stretches and adjusts it until it joins harmoniously. Then it should be that the bandage and exertion are carried out if no hot swelling occurs, then a pillow is carried from above according to the position.
He has included it in a soft tool, if the fracture is downwards towards the underside of the hand, then create a half ball from this tool and command the broken hand to hold it, then pull with a long tool.
Let the hinge be made of skin where it is soft so that the skin adheres with all bends in the palm and is tightened as necessary. If the fracture is outward, it should be made from above and another hinge from below in the hand to keep the hand open upright.
Then, he holds the tension as the hand turns and ties between the fingers with the band. If the fracture is for one of the fingers joints, if it's the thumb then let him adjust as necessary and tension along with the palm. And if you want to make a small hinge standing for it to stand the fracture.
And do not move. If the fracture is for other fingers like the middle finger, ring finger or index finger or wrist, then let him adjust and tie with the next correct finger or tie all on the bone, this is better. Or place a small standing hinge on it if you wish.
As we said about the thumb, inspect while you are correcting and away from the hot tumor. Meet it with what is necessary whenever something like this repeats and describes it.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the correction of thigh fracture.
The thigh bone often breaks and is noticeable by touch because it moves forward and backward. The correction is done by pulling a band over the break and another band below the break, with the patient lying on their face.
Then, each supporting band is extended towards its side with a balance according to this. If the fracture is in the middle of the bone, then it should be tightened with a softer strap either from wool or something like that, if the break is near the thigh's root.
When the thigh bone reaches towards the elbow, the flexion goes upwards and the second ligament is under the break. Similarly, if the break is close to the knee, let the second ligament be close to the knee as well for the flexion to go downwards. Then, the surgeon adjusts the bone with both his hands until it returns to its natural shape.
The bone sets well. If no muscle tumor occurs, then it is necessary to apply the bandage and apply pressure until a tumor hot appears in the case of muscle tumor, leave it for days until the heat from the tumor subsides, then return to its treatment.
And for the pressure, it is necessary to apply a strong and wide bandage for two or three times, leaving some of it. Then place the leg until the heel aligns with the lower part of the knee, and insert a long thread between the thigh and leg near the knee from below. The ends of the thread should come out from both sides above.
Then you should turn on the leg and thigh what is left of the bandage. Then place splints on the thigh at the exact place of the break, making one splint for the thigh bone and then fill in the gap between the thigh and leg with soft padding to ensure an even pressure.
Then start applying strong pressure from the middle at the place of the break, three or four turns depending on it. As you move away from the point of fracture with the bandage, make sure your tension is less and softer.
Then direct both ends of the thread you inserted between the thigh and leg, fasten what lies above with any splints on top. Then pass the ends of the threads downwards until they reach the ankle, also tighten their ends from the other side.
In order that the ligature does not move from its place, then leave tension on it as long as there is no talk of eating or tumor formation and related matters. If something happens in this regard, take action to address it and correct all that has happened according to what we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a fragment in the bone that is shrinking, it should be ground down if possible. If not, split and extract it, then treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals. This may strengthen the break in the thigh without needing to add the leg bones.
As we mentioned about the spine and arm, except that in this case it is not subject to backbending during the backbend. If she only strengthens without including the leg, then her owner will have to permanently have a backbend.
Know that the thigh tightens over fifty days or a little more, or a little less, depending on how different the climates and other conditions are.
The fifteenth chapter.
In the fracture of the kneecap.
The kneecap is rarely affected by a fracture, but it can be affected by many things. If the knee cap is broken, this either means there's a crack or a break within its parts, and this occurs with injury or without injury.
You stand by all of this through touch, and you strengthen it by smoothing out what has fragmented in its parts with your fingers until they come together and join, according to the ability for adjustment and care. Then apply the bandage and bear on it a twisted cloth if necessary.
Then, you tighten above the corresponding tension, and then all conditions we described in other fractures such as the hot tumor should be matched with what is suitable for each until it heals.
The sixteenth chapter.
In the levering of breaking the leg.
Indeed, the leg consists of two bones; one is thick and it's called the thigh bone, while the other is thin and it's called the tibia. There are various types of breakage that may affect the large bone of the upper arm as well. Therefore, levering the leg is similar to levering the arm; either way, the work involved is the same. If both bones of the leg break, the leg will be twisted in all directions. If only the thinner bone breaks and it's at the front part of the leg, then it's something that should be obvious to you. And if only the thicker bone breaks and this happens from below, there is no doubt about it.
Use the lever and the level, and fasten the braces according to that; whether it's if breaking the leg results in a terrible break with many fragments. In this case, make the lever less intense and lighter, and apply your effort gently with the levering technique.
In the leg, there's an additional work compared to the arm. When you level and finish your task of fastening the braces, take two cedar rods that are used for flattening the rooms placed between the grooves of boards or they could be strips from the date palm leaves or something similar.
Choose ones that have a slightly rough texture and are not thin, with their length being equal to the length of the leg from the knee down. Then wrap each one in two spirals along its entire length, placing one on each side of the leg, the other on the opposite side.
Let the rod go from the knee to the bottom of the foot, then tie each fiscuit in three places on both ends and middle. In this way, it prevents the leg from tilting left or right with a strong bandage applied along the entire length of the leg.
And it should be placed in such a way that he is protected from movement, and more importantly this should be done during fractures if there's a special wound. Then examine the leg every day with great attention to know whether there is growth of tumor or swelling or anything else. And if something like that happens, respond with what is necessary until it heals. The thigh bones are forced to heal within thirty days or around that time.
The Seventeenth Chapter.
In fractures of the leg bones and toes.
As for the heel, it should not undergo a pure fracture. As for leg bones, fractures can occur to them, and similarly, very rarely do fractures happen to toes. Most often, dislocations affect them instead.
If there is a fracture in the leg bones and you notice that some of these bones are overlapping each other, then have the patient place their foot on the ground upright like a sheep. Then step onto the elevated part from those bones yourself, press it down, and smooth it out.
Until it returns to its places. Then place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot for the bandage and exertion. After wrapping around it with bandages, ropes, or whatever is needed tightly.
If it has passed three or four days and you release the bandage, you will find that if any of the bones were broken they are now flattened or disjointed. The action should be as you can see fit; however, if some toes have broken, force them back into place according to what I explained for forcing fingers in a similar situation.
Then, make a splint for the broken toe along its length and slightly outward. Then place underfoot the board I described to you and apply it tightly. If more than two or three bones have broken,
Make a notch on each finger of the size of a coin and fit it into a soft belt tied around the ankle. When you bend your foot, let the head of each support stick out from under the foot to properly stabilize it.
And you should not forget to agree upon all that we have mentioned to you in other types of symptoms that we have mentioned, and respond to each symptom with what is appropriate.
The eighteenth chapter.
In the case of a woman's laughter fracture and the agony endured, and mentioning the man.
If the woman's womb has fractured, place her in a reclining position. Then gently lean her back towards her back and have her grip from behind. Then insert cotton into her vagina until it fills it, making it like a ball inside her.
Then, shake the woman gently and lift her slightly. This cotton will come out until it reaches near her vaginal opening like a ball, causing the bone fracture to heal. Then place a support on her back. If she needs to urinate, remove the cotton gently while she does so.
Then, return it to the position you originally inserted or first supported her in. Do this for seven days or about that duration until she adapts. If desired, you can take a sheep bladder, pull a tube into its mouth and insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then inflate the tube with force until the bladder inflates inside the vagina; this helps heal the fracture. Then, fill it with cotton and let her rest for a time as we have described until she recovers. If the thigh bone in either man or woman has fractured, it can be treated similarly to heal it.
This correction was what we described in the thigh bone, and it is not difficult for you to understand this in these strange fractures which are few, especially for someone who has some experience. If you have read my book correctly, then indeed, the fracture itself will guide you most of the time.
On the path of correctness in fixing and strengthening, understand this well. As for mentioning when a man breaks, take an ox's hoof, insert the male part into it, then wrap it with a bandage and tie it. Leave him for three days or about that time until he recovers.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In setting bones with injuries.
It is necessary for the one who has a fracture with an injury, especially if the bone is large such as the thigh bone or the elbow or similar, that you should promptly facilitate its healing within his time according to the conditions of healing as we have provided.
If the injury bleeds, it is necessary to promptly apply a dust of an unperishable substance on it if you do not have another thing for this. Then in setting the fracture on that day itself and do not delay it.
If no hot swelling occurs, if a hot swelling does occur leave setting it for nine days until the hot swelling subsides. Do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all as he may experience bad symptoms due to this.
If the broken bone, exposed on skin, it is necessary to return and fix it by your hands gently and gradually. If you do not have opportunity to return and fix it with your hands, return it using this device which is made of iron having length similar to seven or eight fingers. He would present it to the extent of the wound.
Therefore, the doctor should take three or four of them depending on what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture. They should be cylindrical with a slightly rough surface so that it does not bend when rubbed during work.
And it should have a sharp tip with a smooth side on it, being hard at the top and very delicate from half of it downwards. This is its form:.
And in Greek it's called 'perim' where they want a small peg, so it should have a sharp, beveled tip that fits into the end of the bone and drives it in one go. When the bone returns and settles to some degree, the peg should settle its ends on each other.
If its broken tip is delicate and the machine did not take it well, then it should be cut off at that bone's end so that the machine can take it. If you cannot return the bone to where we described without it, then cut it according to what was mentioned of cuts.
Or spread it out with one of the splints as much as you can, then polish what remains on the bone from roughness and thin scales. If after returning the bone you find that it hurts severely and painfully, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to return it to its natural position, do so. You will greatly benefit the patient. When you have finished setting the bone, dip a splint into a thick, special black drink. If you're in summer, don't cover the wound with a bandage or anything greasy.
To prevent the formation of fungus and decay, use splints while you're free from setting the bones and leave the wound open by cutting slits with scissors that match the size of the wound.
Be extremely cautious not to pull the wound excessively with a fracture; many unskilled physicians have done so, causing their patients either death or deformity. Let our pulling be gentle and different from the pulling of all other fractures.
If the wound is bad or large and I fear some of the bad symptoms we described, which cause pain in the affected area, do not apply splints to it. Instead, make bandages from hard strips that fit under the splints and pull them tight.
If a day or two has passed and you see that the wound is starting to produce pus, remove the cloth placed on it with the wet compress. Then use the ointments we usually apply to wounds like the four-component ointment and its equivalents. It would be advisable for you to change the bandage.
Examine the wound every day in the morning and evening until it heals and clears, and make sure that the member is at a position where pus can flow downwards easily. If it has been many days since the wound occurred but it did not heal or stop producing pus, know that there are small fragments of bone inside.
It is necessary to examine the wound with a probe. If any of those fragments are not removed, remove and extract them. If they were not removed and caused the member to shrink and cause pain, then throw in their cutting and removal through every possible method that you can do it.
If the wound shows signs of gangrene, decay, or other forms of infection and disease, it is necessary to meet each sign with a treatment that matches what you have described in its chapter.
And among what you should consider and make your mind aware of, if a large bone breaks like the femur or spine bones and other major limbs, do not expose yourself to its pull or removal. Many undergo that to death, but I leave them until they decompose; perhaps they may fall apart after twenty or thirty days.
When that happens, treat the wound if I see a place for treatment; otherwise leave it alone,
Chapter Nineteen.
In treating complications that appear after some fractures.
Complications often occur after healing of fractures, especially near joints. They can distort the appearance of the limb and possibly prevent its natural function.
If you notice that the complication is soft, use medications that contract like vinegar, milk, lemon juice, camphor and other similar substances. Take some of these or all of them, mix them with a grippy drink, egg white, or lemon juice.
Hold the treatment on the complication with effort, pull it strongly and leave the pulling for long days without resolving it. Then resolve it and repeat this until the complication goes away, God willing, or bind a piece of well-polished lead plate to it.
The lead has a property that removes anything stuck in the body. If the complication has hardened and become too strong to remove it, cut it from above and remove or disengage the resulting fatty part or some of its debris until it goes away. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In treating fractures where the force was exerted, and afterward the limb remained thin, not according to its original shape.
If the bone fracture was exerted forcefully and afterward the limb remained thin and weak, there are many reasons for this. It could be due to excessive loosening of ligatures and re-tying them improperly, or by over-tightening the ligatures leading to inability of food passage to the organ, or due to excessive pounding, or over-excessive movements at wrong times, or due to scarcity of blood in the weak body.
The treatment for this includes feeding the weak person and enriching his body so that there is plenty of blood in it, using baths, and bringing happiness and joy to him among other things. Then lifting the weight on the organ so that it can attract much food or sustain prolonged pounding with lukewarm water. Until the food passes through it and returns to its natural state.
The twenty-first chapter.
In treating broken bones, if they have been forced and prevented from being applied as they should be.
When an organ has been exposed after being freed from stiffness or correction of a broken bone, or complication and disfigurement resulting in the distortion of that organ. Except when the organ has not been prevented from its natural function, it is not appropriate for someone who claims to break an organ from its root. Many of the ignorant doctors and those forcing things did that in our country.
This act is highly condemned and leads to great harm due to its stiffness. However, if the stiffness and complication are flexible, it should be treated with water that has been boiled in which relaxed herbs such as mint leaves, their roots, king crown, etc., can be found.
It is treated with relaxed powders like the tightly prepared dikhailun or takes the mint leaf juice and mixes it with chicken fat and sherry, then applies it. Or it takes the ripe date and punctures it with the egg of a bath bird, among other medications called anti-sagging remedies.
Reduction of complexity occurs through constant gentle kneading with the hands, and by moving the body parts in all directions at all times; if curvature has occurred and become severe and constricted, necessitating its treatment with iron.
In this, you must cut through it to sever the connection of the bone and make cuts into the excess or complicated area or bones in thin slices. Apply care with caution during this process. Then treat the wound as previously described until it heals.
The twenty-third chapter.
The jaw is a joint that, when it moves out of its place, impedes movement and spoils the appearance of the organ. It causes intense pains and sufferings for the patient. If someone experiences this condition with their jaw, one should promptly address rectifying it.
Delay should not be a concern; if one delays, swelling at the site can occur and make it difficult to rectify the jaw. Therefore, one should neither delay nor move or extend in case of swelling, as this often results in spasms and painful suffering for the patient.
But if this happens, one should immediately address the problem by breaking the bone of the jaw. Wait until the swelling subsides a little bit, then dip the area in hot water and apply oil. Then gently move it back into place and treat each part as described at its respective location.
The chapters on the jaw have also been arranged according to the fractures that occur from above the body downwards.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
In treating the removal of the lower pubic hair.
Remove the pubic hair only in exceptional cases; its removal will have two outcomes: either it partially and gently departs from its place, becoming dormant for a while, or it completely falls out until dormancy occurs. Up to the point of the chest until it starts to stream saliva in excess, making him unable to control it and unable to resist applying pressure on his mouth, causing his tongue to move due to speaking. If his removal is gentle, he can usually return to his normal state more easily under most circumstances.
And if the removal is total, it should ideally hasten his return as soon as possible without delaying it. It is recommended to have a servant hold the head of the person and for the doctor to insert one hand into the root of the pubic hair inside their mouth if the pubic hair comes from only one side.
Or all of his fingers if the pubic hair comes from both sides, and all other fingers are outside. He aligns them with him and instructs the person to relax their pubic hair and release it for it to go in every direction. The doctor aligns the pubic hair and pushes it until it returns to its place.
If returning them is difficult, especially if they are all pubic hair, use the gauze with hot water and grease until their return becomes easier. Do not delay their return as we mentioned. If they return and align properly when the person's mouth is closed without relaxing (meaning after attempting to remove pubic hair), then place bandages on them along with a cotton ball made of beeswax and grease that was prepared, and insert it into the place where the pubic hair should be removed.
Then, tie him gently with a restraining garter. The person should sleep on their back and rest their head between two pillows to prevent them from moving left or right. They are not allowed to chew anything as they should have their food as light liquids.
Until the pain subsides and his jaw tightens, let him eat whatever seems fit to him. It should be done gently, and he shouldn't strain when opening his mouth for eating, drinking or smoking until his jaw tightens and he is relieved.
If the jaws fail to return at a certain point and do not revert to their original positions, many issues such as fevers and constant headaches occur. In some cases, the stomach might be affected, or one might experience frequent vomiting. If you notice this, understand that it indicates a malunion (non-union).
Many die of this condition within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
In dealing with the return of the jaw and the end of the thigh.
As for the trachea, it does not leave the internal side of its connection to the chest. It may move outside and this can be perceived by touch. The treatment is for the patient to lie on his back and extend his arms.
Then apply pressure with your palm firmly. It will return, then place the bandage and braces on it and tighten them. As for the end of the leg that is connected to the thigh, it does not move except in rare cases; if it moves one day, it should return and be adjusted as we have described and what you are preparing for.
Then, place the bandages and braces on it and instruct the patient to stay still and rest until they recover. With this same treatment, the leg will return if it has also left its position.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In dealing with the return of the thigh bone.
Know that the inguinal hernia separates in three directions, one being towards below the pubis and downwards, the second being towards the thorax and it might go upwards. This happens very rarely.
It does not separate towards behind the area of the shoulder blade, nor towards front of the place of the nerve. The inguinal hernia is more likely to separate and protrude downwards towards the knee. This happens especially in those with little flesh, as it goes out quickly and enters quickly.
As for those with a lot of flesh, it is different; they have difficulty in both going out and coming back. It might happen that a blow or fall causes swelling in the inguinal area which feels hot to the touch, making them think it has separated. It would be advisable to test its condition until its actual state can be determined.
Then, when treating it, you will advance in its cure. You will identify the hernia if it moves downwards towards the knee, and if it penetrates between the swollen inguinal ligaments and the normal inguinal ligament, you will find an apparent difference between them. You will also notice a thickened head of the inguinal lump and when touching below the knee, there is a knobbly bump as if it was an egg.
The patient cannot lift their hand to their ear, nor can all movements be done by them. Similarly, if the hernia moves towards the chest or upwards, you will find this obvious on palpation.
This hernia can sometimes ease its return if it is soft or the patient is young. To facilitate its return, have him raise his hand above his head first. Then place my thumbs under his knee and lift the joint upwards to its position. The attendant should lift their hand and extend it upwards.
Then he removes it downwards, and it returns quickly. If it does not return as we described, and if the jaw has been affected for a long time after the incident occurred, it would be necessary to immerse the patient in hot water, use relaxing remedies that make the muscles soft like cooking the root of the bitter apple, the rice pudding, and the king's crown in water and then apply.
The patient then lies on his back. Underneath his knee, a ball of wool is placed which is moderate between softness and hardness. Then the doctor places himself behind this ball and holds the hand of the patient with his hand, extending it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, causing it to move from under him and return to its place. If desired, it can be done this way: have a longer leg than that of the patient, keep him on the side, insert your knee under his elbow, lift his elbow upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. Another servant pulls the patient's hand towards his buttocks. If the patient is light, it may be necessary to attach another object to him to make him heavier. In either case, the jaw returns from its position. It can also respond in another way.
And it is to focus on the ground a long piece of wood, which has a round head like the tip of a bowstring, not too thick or thin. It should be placed under the patient's elbow after making a slightly rough notch at the top of the stick, and the patient stands along the entire length of the stick.
Then he extends his hand downwards from the other side and also extends his body with force from the other side. The joint returns to its place quickly, if it is difficult to return as described, then use this treatment by taking a stick whose length is about two arms long. The description is of a four-finger width, with thickness equivalent to two fingers; it should have a round end facilitating its entry into the depth of the elbow in this illustration.
Then a soft hole is made in the round head so as not to damage the delicate wood. It is inserted under the elbow, and the whole hand along with the arm is moved downwards towards the wood. The wood is tied onto the back of the hand and wrist, and the end of the hand.
Then place the arm on a stand. Extend the hand downwards and have the rest of the body suspended from the other side. The joint should enter its sheath, if it enters in any way, then place a moderate-sized ball of wool under the elbow.
Then the prepared bandage, mixed with terebinth gum and white of egg, is spread over the thigh completely as it rotates from above. Then, the ball is pulled tightly under the elbow and the rope is wound around the bandage from above, attaching his hand to his neck.
And he should not move his hand for seven days. It is necessary to make the food of the delicate person a little cold so that the member strengthens; it heals faster due to its nature. Then after seven days, or five, if there is movement training, and if it has been established and does not relax, then it has healed.
If the joint keeps slipping due to frequent wetness or another reason, it should use the three strands of the string as described in the section on tying when applied. If this has been done in all ways and the bandage is released after seven days without the joint establishing its position.
And repeated the bandaging and tightening, but it did not establish itself. It fell down and relaxed, unable to lift it up. Therefore, know that the nerve in the head of the thigh has either broken or extended, or relaxed. Thus, you will then realize that the joint will never hold its position permanently.
And the jaw that is towards the chest and breastbone, and behind it, is made straight through pushing and pulling with hands until it returns. It uses all stretching and treatment until cleanliness occurs. If there appears a mass in the body after cleaning and movement becomes slower.
And let the patient take hot baths repeatedly until that mass softens and returns to its original nature.
The twenty-seventh chapter.
In treating the shoulder bone fracture.
The shoulder joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty. It dislocates in all directions, especially forward or backward. The dislocation of the shoulder is not hidden from you as it occurs under your vision and touch to whatever shape it may take.
And when you compare the dislocated shoulder to its normal state, it will be evident to you through examining the joint that the arm cannot bend and cannot touch its elbow against you. It is necessary for you to hasten and return the bone to its place before it is presented to you with a hot swelling.
And if it is presented to you with a hot swelling, it becomes difficult to return and perhaps may not be completely healed, especially if the dislocation was towards the back. It is the worst among all types of dislocations and causes severe pain; many times, it is accompanied by death.
And for reduction, if it is possible to return, the attendant should extend his hands and arms fully with both hands of the doctor above the shoulder joint and under it, pushing the joint with all fingers of his hands together or from the base of his palm until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is forward, it can be reduced by bending the hand once until its base strikes the elbow joint that follows it. If the shoulder does not return to its place, use extreme strong stretching and let the attendant extend both arms.
The surgeon also holds the assistant's hands so that when he swells at high tide, then his arm can be moved to every side after he wraps a folded garment or a wide cloth around him. And if the doctor begins by applying oil with his hands on the joint, it will help in easily dislocating the joint.
Then he pushes the joint strongly until it returns. After its return, a bandage containing a grip and drying with egg white should be applied tightly, then the arm is fastened around the neck of the assistant for several days.
If the joint stays in its place, then remove the bandage and leave it. If I see that the joint did not tighten sufficiently, then renew the bandage and leave it for a few more days until it does tighten, then remove it. If there is any body discomfort after the return of the joint and its removal.
If the movement is difficult, then use the steam in the bath, gentle rubbing, and squeezing until it softens. Or make a mechanism like a fat camel's hump under the joint, then tie it on him for a day and night, then remove it and send him to the bath. If he sweats, then rub the joint with an appropriate friction.
Then renew the mechanism three times with bath entries until it softens. If you wish, make him a thick layer of cow's dung that is moist and sticky mixed with oil, and tighten it on him; do this multiple times as he will soften and return to his original state.
The Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
In the treatment of dislocating the wrist.
The wrist joint often dislocates and returns, making its repositioning easier compared to other joints. However, it should be hastened the return of its dislocation right when it starts to dislocate before putting or placing heat on it.
The text describes a surgical procedure where the doctor instructs that the assistant should place the elbow of the patient on a board and extend their hand, while the doctor places his palm on the joint's socket and pushes until it returns. It is crucial to check if the bone has moved towards the inside of the hand.
Let the patient place his palm on the board during stretching and resistance. If the bone is protruding towards the top of the hand, he should have her place her bottom palm on the board so that the doctor's hand can be placed on the same socket of the joint. Should it return immediately or not, then apply a pain-relieving ointment to the affected area.
Leave him alone, he should not repeat the exercise. The bone cannot be forced nor can it withstand the resistance after a few days. By then, the joint will remain bent and won't harm the patient unless his hand relaxes and he is unable to hold onto anything.
When this occurs, you will understand that the nerve has been severed; there's no remedy for it except to apply pressure with your fingers. This may work or it may not have any effect at all. Once the movement of the wrist is regained, apply the ointment we described, then have him hold it in place for five days.
Then, gently prepare the hand. If it's not working and there is a bit of stiffness in it, soften it with hot water and steam several times until it becomes smoother.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
In treating the dislocation of fingers.
Fingers can dislocate in every direction. When one of them has dislocated towards the top or bottom of the palm, extend the finger and push the bone back with your thumb until it returns to its place. Then tie the tip of the finger and hang it towards the side where it has dislocated.
Leave it for two days then release and extend it until its equilibrium is established on that day. If this is done during the night, tie it according to the same description; it will continue to heal by day and be trained by movement at night. Do this every day until it strengthens.
And do the same with it if it bends towards the inner side of the hand, you should tie it in the direction of that side. Do what you did first until she is relieved. And do this with her whenever it bends to any other sides.
Chapter Thirty.
In the treatment of dislocation of the back.
When a dislocation occurs in the series of vertebrae in the back or neck, total dislocation, or when many vertebrae have been displaced from their positions, there is no treatment for it because death will soon follow.
This is indicated by the excrement of the dying person being discharged involuntarily, and he cannot retain it. Often, some of his body parts, either his legs or arms, or one of them, become relaxed. As for when a single vertebra has been displaced from its place, it often happens that it will return to its original position.
When it moves to four directions, the one that moves behind is called an eruption. As for its treatment, if the eruption occurred during childhood, there is no cure for her or from her entirely, and if it happened due to a fall, hit, or similar circumstances.
I have previously mentioned various types of treatment with extensive language that does not increase in utility, and I have shortened it to what is sufficient instead of much, based on my understanding and explanation for him, as well as visualizing the machine differently than they indicate and explain.
I state that there is no remedy for the boil that appears in front of the chest, nor can it be cured. The same applies to boils on both sides as well. Only those which occur at the back need special treatment, particularly as I am describing them, where one would cover their face with a mask.
At a level shop close to a wall, you spread under it a damp mat so that it doesn't hurt his chest. Then place a standing board in a hole dug into the ground at one end of the shop towards his head and another wooden plank towards his feet at the other end of the shop.
And a servant holds the plank and let it not be firmly in the hole. And another servant holds the other one in that manner. Then cover his chest and below his elbows with a soft, tight cloth and extend the cloth to the board near his head and tie him there.
Then, tie another cloth above his buttocks and knees and at the back of his thighs. Then gather all the straps together and fasten them to the other plank near his feet. Each servant holds their side of the plank with the strap, but neither of the two planks is allowed to move from its place.
However, they are not firmly fixed as we said, and the doctor places his hands on the hinges with force until they return or he puts a plank on it, then leans on the plank with his feet until they return. If this treatment doesn't work, take a board whose length is about three arms long.
And dig in the wall that we said should be near the patient, where it enters the edge of the plank. Then place the middle of the plank on the bed, and put the doctor's feet on the other end. Pull tightly until it presses the hinge.
Return to its place, and if you wish to make it using the screw that twists in your hand, then dig in the earth at the head of the amputee at the end of the stump with two pieces of wood whose length is an arm. Do this also under his feet at the end of the stump.
Let there be a span of a hand between each piece of wood. And it has been made in every piece of wood, a hole into which the screw can fit and all the pieces of wood are firmly anchored into the ground so that they do not move and become embedded in a spiral log, which is the screw that turns inside holes of the two pieces of wood.
In its end, there is a hole that has been anchored with a log whose length equals one hand and in the other two pieces of wood like this, then tighten the band which you have tightened on the amputee's chest in the screw at his head, and the bands tightened on his legs in the screw at his feet.
Then he stands at each screw, his hand turning the screw that turns the screw, and the doctor carves the groove as we have provided it, this is a picture of the screw, the stump and the amputated person:.
Then, after the wound has healed and returned to its normal state, it should be that the dried dressing is carried with the whiteness of egg whites. Then comes the effort; then you place over the dressing a pin made from a board whose width is three fingers or thereabouts, and whose length matches the groove's space.
And on some correct nails, then it's tied with the band that should be used. The amputee eats mild food until he is clean. If there remains some scabbing in its place after a long period of healing, it would be necessary to use medications that relax and soften, together with using the board we described for an extended time.
And it is used for that a copper plate, and perhaps it would be exposed at the end of the spinal vertebrae assuming its removal, and there would be an extra bone that has not fallen, so this treatment should not expose him to this, as it might lead to death.
The Thirty-first Chapter.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the knee joint are only prone to dislocation, not any other mild dislocations or indentations as found in other joints. The hip joint can dislocate on four sides.
And that is because it can dislocate inward and outward, forward and backward. It more often dislocates inward than outward or backwards. The sign of an internal dislocation is that when you compare the healthy leg to the affected one, the latter appears longer.
The knee is usually bent more than the normal one. The patient cannot bend his leg when he is in an abduction position, and this becomes noticeable before the femoral head reaches that point.
The sign for the one who dislocates his joint outward is that he exhibits symptoms contrary to these, and for the one who dislocates his joint forward, when standing straight, he can spread out his leg without bending it, unless in doing so he experiences pain in the knee. If asked to walk forwards, he would not be able to do so.
His urine is retained and he walks with a limp, his heels hit the ground when walking. The sign for the one whose joint dislocates backwards is that he cannot fully straighten or bend his knee before his abduction starts, also having a shorter leg compared to the other side.
The Arabic surgical term refers to a relaxed condition where the buttock's top is visibly present at the site of the sacrum. As for various types of this fracture, it involves looking; if an individual was old and had been with its original state without attempting to reverse it and remained in that condition, there is no treatment needed for this kind of fracture.
It should not be exposed to him, and as for the one who dislocated recently, regardless of which type it was from the four faces of dislocation, act promptly by rotating the joint, extending it inwards and outwards, and moving it left and right; this might happen.
He should return without needing other treatments. If he does not return in this way, it is necessary to have a strong servant holding his leg from below either with their hands or with a strap that is tied above the knee on his leg. Another servant should hold him from above.
He should put his hands under his elbows, then pull a soft strap at the root of the buttocks with one end, holding onto that end of the strap with another servant. A third servant holds him either from the front towards the sacrum or from behind towards the back.
All of them hold him for one time until the urine rises from his body to the ground and he remains hanging. This kind of holding is a common type for the four types, if the dislocation returns as we said or otherwise, then each type requiring special treatment must have its own specific remedy.
As for the special repositioning, if the dislocation is towards inside, it should be advised to have the urine raiser lie on his correct side and use a strap at the root of the buttocks between the top of the buttock and the site below the sacrum.
Then the suture is extended upwards from the abdomen to the top of the body towards the pubic area. Then, another attendant holds the thick part of the hip with his arms and stretches it outwards to an extremely long extent; he then returns it to its place.
And this type of treatment is easier than others where a reaction from this member would occur. If you were unable to do so or if it did not respond to entering this kind of treatment, then it should be that all the thighs are bound with a soft strong bandage around the heels and over the knees.
And each of his companions should be four fingers wide, and the withered leg will be extended more than the others by two fingers. Then, he hangs the withered one on a wooden beam that is in the house and which is about two arms length above the ground.
Then, you command a strong boy to hold the thigh, and another attendant holds the withered leg of him. The latter carries the one holding the thigh with force; thus, the joint returns to its place quickly. If it's the case that the jaw is towards the outside, his specific reaction will take place.
The withered one should lie on the bed as described in our companion of the cup as to how he was described for the person with the gourd. The sash should be tightened around his withered leg especially, and also around his chest. Then, two wooden beams are placed under his legs and another one at his head. A longer beam is then set in the middle of the bed firmly.
He might have wrapped her in a damp cloth to prevent the withered one from being harmed and place wood between her thighs so that she doesn't sag downwards during stretching. Then, each attendant stretches towards his side; meanwhile, the doctor smooths the thigh with his hands, if he responds upon returning.
Otherwise, place the plate on it and fasten it as we mentioned in the chapter, whether it is necessary that the patient should be laid on his correct side, and if the amputation is made at the front part, it would be better to extend the patient's leg once while he remains in this position on the operating table.
The doctor places his right hand on the patient's elbow, then presses it with the other hand. Yet, he extends the pressure downwards to the knee area. If the amputation is at the back, it would not be appropriate for the patient to lie down.
He should be elevated from the ground; it is necessary that he be placed on something firm. In addition, his arms and legs should be extended outward according to what we have mentioned about his position on the operating table. He should be lying on his side with straps tightened.
As we mentioned earlier, it is necessary to use the plate on the place where the joint came out. If the hip joint returns as it should and its return sign is not hidden from you, which is that you extend the legs of the patient.
If you see both of them level and the patient curls and extends his legs without discomfort, know that the limb has returned as it should. Then join the thighs, hold the dressing in place, and tighten with a firm grip on the waistband to prevent the hip from moving to any direction.
The patient must rest for three or four days, then remove the bandage and dressing. Replace the leg with the other side. If you see them at the same level in terms of measurement, know that the bone has set; release the patient to walk if you do not observe anything about relaxation.
Refer, suture and tighten according to the initial tension you have, leave it also for three days. Then, dissolve it and walk on them for days until it heals well, God willing.
The Second and Third Chapters.
In the treatment of dislocating the knee.
The knee dislocates on three sides: it dislocates inwards, outwards and downwards meaning behind. It does not dislocate towards the front of the body. The sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to pull his leg up to his calf.
If it does not stick to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated. Stabilize all sides of its dislocation by having him sit down while stretching his legs if he can do so; or have a servant sit behind him to hold him in the middle and gently pull him slightly towards the back. Then, you sit on his calves.
And press your back against his face, put his leg between your legs. Then stabilize his knee with your hands and tuck them under him between your fingers on his knee. Then press each side of his knee firmly with your hands while another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
The sign of it returning is that the leg sticks to the thigh in a soft manner, without resistance. Then, press it and stick his leg onto his thigh. Then tie all together with a bandage for three or four days then release them. It should only be subjected to light walking until it heals.
If it is not possible for you to return her as we described, otherwise, use the powerful extension with the straps that I have provided instructions for in treating the hip until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-One
In the treatment of removing the heel spur.
The heel can be partially removed, or it can completely break. Breaking the heel can either occur inside or outside. A sign of breaking is to see the heel puffed up and prominent in the direction towards which it has broken.
As for treating a partial removal, it is easier to correct and involves gently applying pressure with hands until it returns to its original position. As for treatment when it has completely broken, the patient should sit down and be held by a strong attendant from behind at the waist.
Then, with your right hand you hold her top of the foot and with your left hand from below in the position of the ankle. Then, pull the foot towards you with your right hand then with your left hand two times. After that extend it with your left hand and push the foot's chest towards the thigh without violence.
This is done twice as described, then in the third time push the foot's chest towards the thigh while pulling the ankle. If it returns to its position after one or two times in this manner and you see the foot level, otherwise redo the work on it because it will return.
If it refuses to return as described, otherwise place the patient on his back on the ground and dig in deeply into the earth with a stick to make sure it falls between his thighs. I've wrapped him tightly so he won't be harmed. Then, adjust his ankle strap.
Then, another attendant extends the leg either with his hands or with a girth that ties around the calf of the leg. Then, each attendant holds the other's movement opposite from what he is doing; a bend is kept between the thighs so as not to allow the body to sag downwards during the extension, and then the doctor corrects the heel with his hands.
A second attendant holds the healthy leg downwards, so that the jaw returns quickly. When the jaw returns and you see it is returning properly, hold the bandage and tension, securing it tightly with straps, and drag the foot downwards with the strap. It is advisable to avoid touching the nerve located behind the heel.
So that the strap does not hurt him, you should leave it on for two or three days. If the strap becomes too loose after this time, tighten it again and then release it on the third or fourth day. The invalid is to refrain from walking for forty days.
If he walks before this period, there is a risk that his jaw might weaken and cause harm, and it will not accept treatment after that. In case of fever or inflammation, the methods described for other treatments should be used until it subsides.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the treatment of a broken foot.
It is necessary to smooth out what has broken off from it with a gentle, short length. This is not difficult but makes the process easier. If the break occurred in some part of the foot's back, it is advisable to have the invalid place his foot on an even surface on the ground.
Or on a plank while standing as if you were walking. Then, stand yourself and place your foot on the part of this joint that we are treating. Then press it with your foot firmly until you see that it has been smoothed out, and there is no indication of unevenness in the location.
Then, place under the sole of his foot a board that takes in all parts of the foot, and it should have two ends. Then tighten it firmly with firm tightness for three days, then loosen and protect him from walking for many days until he strengthens enough to return if God wills.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
In the types of jaw disarticulation which occurs with injury, or with fracture, or both.
Something of that sort happens very often, and when it comes to its treatment and repositioning, it usually leads to death.
Therefore, it should not be attempted to treat such cases except by one who is skilled in technique, persevering, careful and calm, not rash or overconfident. He should start with the use of medicines that relieve hot swellings only and surrender himself to fate.
To destiny, O God, except for what you desired of safety from the discomfort with a light disease, and where you showed some hope in it, reject its response from your protection at first before the hot tumor manifests.
If the member returned as I desired, use the procedure that relieves hot swellings and treat the wound with what is suitable from dry ointments. If the jaw was involved in a fracture and there were clean fragments of bone, remove them. And adhere to what we mentioned in simple diseases as provided in their respective sections.
And strive, purify your efforts from entering the path of errors as you've been advised and instructed. That will ensure safety for you and protect you, if Allah wills.
