Chapter Forty-Eight.
On treating tumors that occur under the armpit.
These tumors that occur under the armpit are of the scrofulous kind, hard, contained in a sac, and some of them contain fluids.  Those that contain fluids should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner.
From line B to line C. When you have evacuated all the fluid from the tumor, pack it with worn cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type of scrofulous nodes, incise it as we mentioned in the incision on scrofula.  If the wound continues to suppurate, use cautery as we mentioned previously.
