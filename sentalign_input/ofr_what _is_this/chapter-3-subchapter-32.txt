of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inwards and outwards, and backwards; and it does not dislocate forwards.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend their leg to their thigh, and if it does not join to their thigh, know that it is dislocated; and the restoration of all is that you have the patient sit upright, and extend their leg if they can, and put your back against their face, and put their foot on your feet; then take their knee in your palms, and pull between your fingers, then bend both sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends their foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that they can easily bend their leg to their thigh; and apply the plaster, and have the leg bound to the thigh, and bind them together tightly for three or four days, then unbind it; and the patient should not exert themselves to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not right, then administer strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
