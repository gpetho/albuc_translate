of the fistula of the eye
Doctors call a fistula "arissati": when you treat it with cautery and with a sharp burning medicine as I have said before, and it is not healed, then the trick is to cut open the abscess, where it has settled, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it with the instrument whose form is shown here; and it is called "rough head," and let it be made of Indian steel with a round head, and be pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the site of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little so that you know that the corruption is scraped; and do this a few times, then restore the area with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the swelling is healed, and remains so for 40 days, and it does not reappear and is not abscessed, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed; if not, there is no other way than to bring the fistula back to the opening of the nose according to this form: and that is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered take a drill according to this form, and let the head be iron with three angles, and the shaft be thinned down to the head as you see here:
Then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand slightly away from the eye, then turn the drill until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the air comes out if he holds his hand over his nose; and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter goes to the nose; so it is an easier thing for the patient.
