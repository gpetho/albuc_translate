Chapter twenty-five on warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Often a wart grows on the edge of the nose, it grows and increases with the days until its appearance becomes ugly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and completely uproot it, then apply to the area either cauterization or a burning medication that acts as cauterization.
If you miss cutting it until it grows, then look: if it is petrified, hard, dark in color, and has little feeling, do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous tumor.
And I have often seen those who cut this tumor suffer a great affliction as a result.
If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that it is possible to cut it completely, then induce vomiting in the sick person, and cut it without hesitation or delay, and treat the area with something that dries and constricts until it heals.
