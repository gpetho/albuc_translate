Chapter XXVI.
On the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when continuity is dissolved by wound or similar.
Know that when a solution of continuity happens in one of these cartilages, little confers in that operation except in some men.
So, when one of these causes happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then you join the two lips of the wound with suture, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each one is healed, then you must scrape each part of its apparent scab until blood comes out.
And then join the two lips with suture and tighten them, and sprinkle over them dragon's blood and pounded incense, and place over the powder a piece of diafinicon plaster, or some other consolidating plaster, and leave it tied for two or three days, and then untie it and change the plaster and leave it until the threads by themselves are detached, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
But the manner of suturing is that you join the solution of continuity either with needles as we have recounted in the suturing of the belly, or you join the solution of continuity with thread as you have been taught.
