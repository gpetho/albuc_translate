On Cauterizing Toothache.	On cauterization for toothache.	0.8523905
If the toothache is caused by cold, or if there are worms in it, and the treatment with medications is not effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fat or cauterization with fire.	When the toothache arises on account of cold, or if there be a worm in the tooth, and medical treatment does not avail, then cauterization should be undertaken. There are two ways of doing this, one with butter, the other with the cautery.	0.82531047
Cauterization with fat is as follows: You take cow's fat and boil it in an iron ladle or in a shell. Then you take cotton and wrap it on the end of a probe, then dip it in the boiling fat and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools.	Cauterization with butter is done thus: take cows' butter and let it boil in an iron ladle or pan; then take cotton wool, wind it round the top of a probe, and dip it in the boiling butter and quickly apply it to the aching tooth and hold it there till cold.	0.887102
Then you repeat it several times until the strength of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. And if you wish, you can dip wool or cotton in cold fat and place it on the aching tooth, and place the heated iron on top of it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.	Repeat this a number of times till the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. If you prefer, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and put it on the aching tooth, then on top of that apply the hot iron until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.	0.90105134
Cauterization with fire is as follows: You use a copper or iron tube, somewhat thick so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.  Then, heat the cautery iron which appears in the illustration and place it on the tooth itself, and hold your hand steady until the cautery iron cools. Do this several times.	The actual cautery is administered thus: take a tube of bronze or iron with some thickness in the body of it so that the intensity of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then heat a cautery whose figure will be given shortly, and apply it to the tooth itself and hold your hand until the cautery gets cold.	0.87235993
The pain will go away either that same day or the next.  Following the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good quality fat, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out.  This is an image of the cautery iron.	Do this several times over; the pain will certainly depart the same day or the next. After this cauterization the patient is to fill his mouth with good butter and keep it in for a while, then spit it out. This is the figure of the cautery.	0.79711735
Cauterize with whichever end you want and according to what is possible. This is a picture of the tube.	Cauterize with whichever end you prefer according to circumstances. This is the figure of the tube.	0.80586934
