Chapter Fifty-Two:
On the cauterization of corrodent ulcers.
Corrodent is a moving corruption in the limb, which eats it away like fire consuming dry wood.
So if you see this corrodent in a place that can tolerate fire cautery, then heat several small nail-like cauteries, making them large as needed for the location of the corrodent.
Then cauterize all around it until you eradicate all the corrosion and no trace of it remains.
Then leave it for three days, and apply a mixture of ground alum and oil on the cauterized areas until all the scabs are removed and all the corruption is gone.
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
But if after three days you see that the flesh is growing healthily without corruption, it is good; otherwise, repeat the cautery on what remains in the corrupted places.
Corrodent is sometimes treated with sharp medicine, which is applied in place of cautery.
However, fire cautery is usually more effective.
I have already discussed the treatment with sharp medicine in another section, so use that when necessary.
