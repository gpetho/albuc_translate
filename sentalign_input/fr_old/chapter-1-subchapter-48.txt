of swelling
When swelling comes to any member and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the member according to the size and smallness of the member; and let the cautery be a little penetrating into the thickness of the core; then treat with ointments until healed. And sometimes a cautery is made on the hand and foot and back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the member, and thus the swelling is removed; and nevertheless, no one should undertake this if they do not know the members and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
