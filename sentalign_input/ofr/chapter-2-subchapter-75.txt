on childbirth
The midwife must first understand the process of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pushing downwards, and desires to smell aromatic scents:
then the child hurries to come out;
then know that this birth is according to the natural process, and the exit is under its head, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, you should press lightly on her belly, so that the child comes out quickly;
for when it descends headfirst, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its excess fluids by a good cleansing;
and the one that comes differently does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes feet first, and the body or the head comes out first, and the hands, or it comes out on its stomach, or sideways, and is sometimes turned on its neck, and in other bad positions;
so it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skilled in these things, and to beware of error and deception, and I will show you all the positions and how one should help.
If the child comes headfirst in a natural way, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, have her sit on a chair, where the women will hold her;
and stimulate her nature with oil or cooked fenugreek, and then the midwife should put between her fingers the small spatula of which here is the form: 
and tear the afterbirth, and cut with her fingernail until the moisture that is inside runs out;
and press the woman's belly so that the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil;
then make her sneeze using condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour:
the child will come out immediately.
And if both hands come out, you must gently push them back in little by little;
and if they cannot enter, place the woman on a seat and raise her feet up high;
then suddenly drop the seat to the ground, and someone should hold the woman so she doesn't fall during the drop;
and if the hands cannot enter and the child dies, cut off the hands with the knife previously mentioned, and extract the child, and reposition it properly.
of the delivery of the child on its feet
When the child comes feet first, you must push it upwards;
and then turn it little by little, until it is straight;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When he jumps up to the thighs, instruct her to take them, and make her sneeze with pepper;
then he will jump out, God willing.
And if it doesn't come out as we have said, then turn it little by little until it is in accordance with its natural form.
For then it comes out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum, and grind everything in a mortar;
and apply it to the woman's genitals inside and outside with this ointment, then have her sit in warm water up to below the ribs;
and when she is softened below, make her a pessary of myrrh, and place it inside her, and leave it for an hour;
then have her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and hold her mouth and nose, and press lightly on her belly, for the child will jump out immediately.
of the delivery of the child onto its knees
When the child comes in this manner, the midwife should put her hands there little by little; 
then it should be supported by its neck, and its feet hanging down, and it should be lying on a bed;
and fold its hands little by little, and then take its hands on its belly, and remove the cushions from beneath, so that it is positioned downwards;
and if the child does not jump, then take its feet and move them strongly, then move its belly upwards, then push your hands there;
and rock the child gently;
and instruct the woman to push until the child comes out.
regarding the delivery of a child who comes out hand first
One must skillfully work to bring the hand back:
if one cannot bring it back, then have the woman stand up and walk;
if she cannot walk, then have her lie down on a bed, and raise her legs firmly;
then administer the lubricating preparation that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, have her sit on a seat, then work on bringing the hand back;
and deliver the child according to its natural position, and make her sneeze, and tell her to push until the child comes out.
with the child coming out onto its neck, and its hands spread out, and its face turned towards its mother's back
It is necessary that the midwife hold her hand, then turn it little by little, and deliver it gently;
And when it is even, apply a mixture of marshmallow root and oil to the area, as we have said, then tell her to move little by little;
And when you have done this, have her sit on a chair, and tell her to push;
and make her sneeze.
In this same way with the entire afterbirth.
When it comes out in this way with the entire afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your fingernail, until the moisture is drained;
And if the child hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the navel so that it is not held back and the child dies;
Then push the child inside, until you have positioned it as it should be, and tell the woman to bear down sometimes:
Then it will come out easily.
of the delivery of twins
Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born;
and this is not a strange thing, and it happens rarely.
Two are a strange thing, and do not usually live, except rarely;
I know this, that they are multiplied, and are separated by the membrane that divides them, which is attached to the uterus;
and sometimes they emerge as naturally as a single child, as we have said.
And if they come out with difficulty, treat them as we have said, and let the midwife be skilled, and do what she does quickly and lightly;
and act in such a way as is best for their well-being.
of multiple children
Sometimes one or two or three or four or five or six or seven are formed in the womb, or more, up to fifteen, and they are all formed in the shape of a child by the measure of the glorious wise [God?], and the midwife must know all this, for perhaps such a thing will happen to her;
so let her act accordingly.
