Of the fracture of the kneecap
Know that the kneecap rarely fractures, but it often dislocates. And if it fractures, it is usually just a crack or a small hole, and it happens both with and without a wound, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is such that what is round is set evenly with your fingers, until it is as closely joined as possible; then apply the poultice, and place a round splint, if needed, and bind it as necessary, then address all the conditions we mentioned in other fractures, such as hot abscesses and similar; and apply to each condition what is needed, until it is healed.
