You must scrape the bark on top with the point of a spatula or your fingernail, which prevents it from moistening; then treat it until it is healed as it should be; and if it cannot heal, repeat the scraping more strongly than before, until it bleeds a lot, and is excoriated; then treat it until it is healed.	If they become chronic, and medical treatment is unavailing, you should scrape them with the edge of a scalpel or with your finger-nail until they become soft and the upper layer, that prevents healing, is removed; then dress until they mend as they should. But if they do not heal, repeat the scraping more strongly than at first until they bleed freely and become raw; then apply dressings and they will heal.	0.788733
