Chapter Twenty on Pushing Back Protrusions of the Eye
If the eye swells in its entirety, and no damage or impairment occurs in vision, then it is necessary to give the patient a laxative, then bleed him in the cephalic vein.
Then place a cupping glass on the nape of the neck without scarification and perform a gentle suction.
Then apply to the eye a poultice made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocol.
Then bandage the eye firmly over the poultice with many compresses.
The method for the compresses is to take many soft rags and fold each rag into four folds, making many of them, then place them one on top of the other to the extent needed by the eye, then tie them firmly with a strong cloth.
And repeat the cupping with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, then it should be tightened well.
Then remove the bandage after a day and a night as we said.
If you see that the eye has returned to normal, then good, otherwise repeat the poultice, compresses, bandaging, and cupping until it returns to normal.
