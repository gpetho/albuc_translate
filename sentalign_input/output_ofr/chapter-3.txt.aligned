Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and concerns the repair of fractures and dislocations.	ON BONE-SETTING This third part of the book, too, is an essential necessity in the practice of medicine; it concerns the setting of the fracture or dislocation occurring in bones.	0.64852923
Know, dear son, that fools throw themselves into this chapter, who have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read a letter of them;	You should know, my sons, that ignorant practitioners and laymen and those who have never turned the pages of a single book of the Ancients about it, nor studied a single letter of it, arrogate this part of the art to themselves.	0.73722136
and for this reason, knowledge is scarce in our land, for I never found any good one;	For this reason this section of the science has died out in our parts; I have myself found no one competent in it; and whatever skill I have, I have derived for myself by my long reading of the books of the Ancients and my thirst to understand them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.	0.55402833
and I know nothing of it except through the knowledge of ancient books, which I have studied so much that I have extracted the knowledge, and through experience, and through the practice of my life;	Then through the whole of my life I have adhered to experience and practice. So now I have described for you in this book all that my knowledge has encompassed on the subject and that my experience has encountered; I have made it accessible for you and rescued it from the abyss of prolixity; I have reduced it to a brief outline; and have explained it most clearly.	0.61964417
and I have here described in this chapter what is contained, and have abbreviated it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are administered, as I have done in these two preceding chapters.	I have made for you many drawings of the instruments that are used in it, which is an adjunct to explanation, as I did in the two previous books.	0.6146233
