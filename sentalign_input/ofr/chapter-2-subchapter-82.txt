Formice is a small, misshapen/irregular appearance around the body, and it goes very deep;
and sometimes the cold finds it, and it feels as if numb with cold, and it occurs all over the body, and more in the hands than elsewhere. 
And the treatment is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place this quill upon the formice, so that the circle encompasses the formice all around;
then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the formice, and put it in deep, and pull out the formice by its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a quill made of brass or iron according to this shape, and it should be thin underneath and sharp on top:
not sharp enough to pierce, so that it can be held by the finger, and also pressed.
And if you wish, cauterize the formice, as described earlier in the chapter on cautery.
