On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If its connection is severed by a wound or something similar, know that whenever a separation occurs in one of these cartilages, the procedure rarely succeeds except in some people.	On suture of nose, lip, and ear, when there is discontinuity from a wound or the like. You should know that when discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, treatment of them rarely does any good, except in a few people.	0.9090018
So when something like this happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with blood, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and then treat it until it heals.  And if the separation has separated its edges and each side has become sound, then you should scrape each side to the thickness of its visible skin until it bleeds.	When such a thing happens to anyone, look carefully, and if the wound be fresh and bleeding, bring the edges of the wound together with a suture, and dress them till they are healed.	0.7827522
Then bring the two edges together with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle on them powdered acacia and frankincense, and apply over the powders a plaster of palm ointment or other healing ointments, and leave it tight for two or three days, then loosen it.	If the discontinuity has separated the edges, and both edges have healed, it is necessary to scrape both edges on the external skin till they bleed; then bring the edges together with a suture and dust over it dragon's blood and olibanum; and put over the powder a plaster of Palm ointment or some other of the regenerative ointments, and leave bandaged for two or three days; then unbandage and change the medicine, and let the sutures come away of themselves; and afterward dress with ointment till healed.	0.7396285
And change the medication and leave it until the sutures dissolve on their own, then treat it with the ointment until it heals. The method of suturing is to bring together the separated connection either with needles as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread as we explained to you there.	Now the manner of suturing is to close the discontinuity, either with a needle, as we describe for suture of the belly, or with a thread as we tell you there.	0.6088095
