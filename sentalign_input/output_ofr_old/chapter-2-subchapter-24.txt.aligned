Sometimes there grow in the nose diverse fleshy additions, some of which resemble scorpions with many feet; and there are some such that there is flesh ingrained with a pale colour, and some have soft flesh of good colour.	Sometimes there arise in the nose various superfluous fleshy growths. One of these is a thing resembling a centipede; another, a cancerous growth, stony, hard, and pale in colour; another again is a soft growth, not pale.	0.74515593
In this case, for those fleshy growths which are soft, and not ingrained, you must make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open their nostrils, and cast the hook at those fleshy growths, and pull them out; then cut what you can hold with the fine, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the flesh is entirely removed.	Any of these growths that is soft is not malignant or cancerous. You should make the patient sit before you, facing the sun, and dilate his nose and introduce a hook into these polyps and draw them out; then amputate what you can take hold of, with a fine scalpel sharp on one side, till you know that all the growth is gone.	0.78254235
And if any part remains that cannot be cut, then open it with one of the fine instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if the blood overcomes you, or a hot abscess forms, treat it as needed; and if it is a malignant abscess, hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stanched and all the flesh removed, then put a mixture of water and vinegar or wine into the nose.	And if there be anything of them left behind that you cannot cut away, then gently scrape away with any fine instrument till nothing of them remains; and if the bleeding be too much for you, or an abscess occur, then combat it by suitable means. If it be a malignant swelling, then speedily cauterize till the bleeding stops and all the polypi are gone. Then introduce into the nose, after the incision, vinegar and water, or wine; and if the nose be free and fluid flow into the throat from it, then know that he is cured.	0.9125511
And let it be of silver or brass, resembling an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit likewise; and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full for cleansing the head; and let it have a handle at the end for holding it when heating the oil or some liquid.	It should be made of silver or bronze like a small lamp, its oil-container open, and with its channel likewise. If you like you may make its spout closed like a reed; and the oil-container of the instrument can be made covered over. It has a handle at the end, as you see, to hold it when heating the oil or whatever juice or other liquid you wish.	0.8912811
