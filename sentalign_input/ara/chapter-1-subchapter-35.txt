Chapter Thirty-Five.
On Cauterizing Warts.
After cutting them: When you have cut the wart, heat the cautery iron that resembles an awl. Then, insert it hot into the place of the cut wart, and push your hand in deep, until the cautery iron reaches the opening of the vessel from which the blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described. Then, treat them with suitable ointments until they are healed. And if you cauterize them also with a large cautery on the cotton, it will be more effective.
