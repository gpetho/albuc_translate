Chapter Nine:
On the Cauterization of Paralysis and the Softening of the Entire Body
You should proceed with cleansing the head with jars and the remedies we have mentioned; then shave the patient's head, and cauterize with a cautery iron in the middle of the head, on all the horns of the head, on the nape of the neck, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
If necessary, in the case of softening of the body, if the disease is severe and the patient can tolerate it, then make four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally cauterize until the skin is deeply burned, and then lift your hand.
Then treat the area until it is healed, and this should be an olive-shaped cautery.
