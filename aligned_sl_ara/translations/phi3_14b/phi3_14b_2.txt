He who wrote this book completed it for you, O my son, is a part of the science in medicine and reached its highest degree in clarity and explanation; I have seen that he has completed it for you with this treatise which was written by hand.
Since work done by hand has been improved in our land and during our time, it almost led him to study his science and cut the traces of his influence. Yet it remained as a walking tradition in the books of the ancients, his handwriting and mistakes became evident and distorted until its meanings were closed off and lost its benefits.
I saw that he revived and incorporated it in this treatise along the path of explanation, clarification, and summary, bringing images of surgical knives and various tools used as an increase in detailing and a means to aid understanding where needed.
The reason there is no improved craftsman by hand in our time is because the profession of medicine has been long and its master should have previously studied Galen's anatomy which he described. Until it stands on the benefits of the limbs and their nerves, moods, connections, separations, knowledge of bones and nerves, muscles, number, exits, pulses in the heart chambeinestems and branches, and their positions.
Therefore, he said that surgeamoents are named too often and in fact few, especially in the field of handcrafts, and we have mentioned this from one side at the beginning of this book.
Because he was not an expert as we mentioned in the section on dissection, it is possible that one may err and kill people with it, as has been often seen where many have depicted it in this field of knowledge without understanding or experience.
That's because I saw an ignorant physician cut a tumor on the neck of a woman, and he severed some neck veins causing her to bleed out until she fell dead between his hands.
I saw another physician administering an enema to a man who had a perforation, and the abscess was large causing him to discharge a piece of his prostate gland. The man died towards three days, and I had called for his evacuation where I saw tissue from the prostate gland and assessed the severity of the condition.
I saw another physpert who was practicing surgery on a patient from our land.
An incident occurred where a black man had a fracture in his leg near the knee with a wound caused by a sharp object. The fastest surgeon acted unknowingly, tied off the tear on the wound with sutures and thread tightly without allowing the wound to breathe.
Then he released his desires and left him for days, ordering not to untie the stitches until the leg and foot swelled up, and a doctor was present when death occurred.
He prayed to God, and the fastest untied the stitches for relief; however, only sickness had taken hold of him, and I could not save him.
The corruption did not stop within the body until death occurred.
I saw another physician fussing and grumbling after days until the master's limbs swelled up, suggesting that if cancer is mixed with black powder from Sodomite lands, it should not be exposed to heated iron.
Except that in a body, it may have absorbed everything.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two categories: the safe and unsafe work accompanied by disorders in most cases.
He has warned in every place that comes from this book about the work of the Gharrah and GhulÅ«f, which it is incumbent upon you to beware and reject.
Lest the ignorant find a way to speak and slander, take heed for yourselves with bandages and honey (or beeswax) and accompany your sickness with support and adhesion.
They employed the best method leading to safety and blissful outcomes, while avoiding dangerous hard-to-treat diseases of the kidneys.
They guided themselves away from what they fear might enter your religion and marriage, so it remains intact with you, raises up in the worldly and hereafter for your sake.
In some of Galen's instructions, do not regard an illness as such but consult physicians in error instead.
This article has been divided into three parts.
Part One.
In the furnace, from pot to pot mixes the compound of lead and concentrated medicines spanning handspan to foot, images of instruments, surgical tools and everything needed for work by hand.
Part Two.
On cauterization, cupping and scraping, sizing, surgery, the extraction of thorns, and approaches to these, all mixed and arranged along with images of instruments.
Chapter Three.
In fractures and dislocamtios, and treating the frozen joints, including drawings of instruments.
Chapter One.
Regarding the digestive system.
Before mentioning the work itself, it is important to discuss its benefits and drawbacks, as well as who should use it.
I say that the long-winded speech, the precise knowledge and secret wisdom were spoken by a group of wise men.
They differed in it, and their concise speech was out of fear of being long-winded.
I say that the digestive system is beneficial for every ill temperament, whether with a solid substance or without (food), consisting of two types: hot without food and dry without food.
As for the dry temperament with food, some of them said that digestion is beneficial in it, while others opposed this and said: "The digestive system does not help in a condition characterized by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is hot and dry.
And it is unlikely to heal a condition characterized by heat and dryness with hot foods, but those who oppose this say: "Digestion in the nature of fire may benefit from a hot-dry condition that occurs due to constipation. Because when you add the human body and moisten it with hot temperament, you make the body of the person cold.
And I say according to his statement that the experiment has shown it multiple times that one should not conceive of this matter as having been previously led and tamed in the doorway of knowledge. And he stood on the difference of people's temperaments and their conditions, in themselves, and reasons, and symptoms, and duration.
And as for the concoctions, have no fear of them and especially not the cold humid diseases; all physicians agreed upon it and they did not differ at all in its effectiveness.
And know, my son, that from the secret treatment by fire is preferred over drugs of burning nature because fire is an essence unique which does not transgress its action upon a part without harming another connected with it except for damage to progress.
And the drugs of burning nature may transgress its action upon parts beyond and perhaps cause a disease in a part which hinders cures, and maybe kill; fire has nobility and essence does not do so unless overdone.
It has been shown to us by experience the length of service and care in the craft, and standing on the truths of the matter.
For this I have been spared the length of speech, even though it does not agree with my book you found in the fire secretly and how to do them on the body and against diseebs with your philosophical syllogism that strikingly confirms your insights.
And know, O son, that they have differed in the time when healing is done and made the best of times the time of spring.
And I say that healing may be done in any time for the harm already present to take the benefit of which is achieved by curing. And especially if healing is a powerful necessity stemming which must not be delayed lest it result in the most severe consequences of internal harm caused by time.
And do not suppose, O son, what the general populace believes and those who think that to heal a disease means it never returns, they make it lethal.
You must not assume that the cure is only in sedatives that improve mood and dry up humors, which are the cause of the ailment.
But the cure is preferred over medicine for its rapid success, effectiveness, and potency of action.
And the illness may return at some time depending on the state of the patient, and what enables it to prevail, its strength, and what accumulates in its body from folly and self-neglect through obtaining nourishment.
O God, that the illness treated with cure is a mild illness and involves little humors. Like the cure of toothache and its approach, it may not return that pain and be at least minimal.
And what the general population also says that cure is another type of medicine because they believe no treatment but remedies works after its occurrence and without it, other than that.
And in fact, another meaning of cure is that we use the treatment for diseases when those medicines do not work and then resort to another type of remedy which benefits us until it occurs as a different medicine. There is no meaning to what the common people and many ignorant doctors have gone after.
The preliminaries stated that gold (al-Kiy) is better than iron (Al-Hadid), and they said so for the balance of gold and the essence of its nobility, stating it does not tarnish the location of the (surgical) instrument or anything else.
Because I tried that, it was found to be so in some cases without one another; the (spectacular) instrument made of gold is better and superior to iron as they said 'if you warm the needle over fire from gold, you will not know when to heat to the degree desired for the redness of gold'.
Because it speeds up the cooling process and if you apply heat to it, it melts in the fire and adheres well from that for the incision made by the instrument; thus, the iron (instrument) was quicker and closer to perfection for the procedure as God wills.
This section has been arranged from the head to the foot for ease of learning by the student as God wills.
The first chapter.
On surgery and a single gold instrument.
This technique is affected by the humidity and cold on both types of brain, which are the cause for headaches, excessive dripping from the head to the eyes and ears, insomnia, toothache, and sore throat. In essence, the diseases presented by cold such as Falghee and sore throat are related to this illness.
The illustration of this technique depicts the disease first being relieved by a head-related purgative medicine for three or four nights, depending on the severe nature and strength and frequency of the illness.
Next, it instructs to have the head shaved and sit reclined with hands placed on the chest.
Then, place your index finger on the nose tip between their eyes and mark that spot with a thread.
Lastly, heat a zedoary poultice as depicted in this image.
Remove as much bone from the head as is equivalent to a walnut or chestnut in size, remove your hand and immediately reapply it using an iron rod of the same temperature or another one if cooled. Until you see what I mentioned about the bone, then take something from horse salt in water and drink it with a small cup placed on that spot for three days.
Then take a woolen cloth moistened in cold water and leave it on him until the scabricate passes over, then treat with the four-fold compress to heal if God wills.
They said that the wound, as it healed open and oozing pus, was better and beneficial.
Some of them mentioned that the skin should be scraped down to the bone, and the spatula held until some part of the bone is charred; then it would be treated after the charring on the bangs is removed.
Others said that the spatula should be used deeply until it has a strong effect on the bone, causing small chalk-like or fleck pieces to fall off from the bone; they claimed that this would allow phlegm to escape and clear from the skull for an extended period with the wound remaining open.
Then he treats until it is sealed over, and I do not see either of these types of scraping done among some people or on the road; leave it as best you can with safety if the skull has begun to fissure when its natural connection starts to separate, as we have seen in previous cases.
Not especially when the head of the illness is weak by nature and the first kind of cure should be taken, which is best for it to be used on one'e who suffers from it, God willing, administer this remedy if He wills.
Chapter Two.
Surgery of the head also.
If there is a chronic headache and the illness has lasted long, use poultices, compresses, purgatives, ointments, and suppositories; especially if none of what we described has helped him at all. The head of the illness has strengthened by nature and was not weak, he found a very severe fever with another remedy over it somewhat. Then apply a poultice on each horn of his head until the skin is flushed and releases the bone that we described. And apply a poultice on the very end of his head in the place known as the nose, and hold your hand lightly there; if the bone does not emerge then the illness has intense pain unlike any previous remedies for the head, I will mention this poultice at its location.
It is necessary that the skull drill used to drill at the top of the head and its back be gentle compared to the skull drader used in the middle of the forehead, which is depicted as such.
Chapter Three.
The sister's occasional fever.
If a head wound occurs with pain and the pain extends to the eye, empty the condition of the skull by using purifying drugs for the head and applying the treatment I mentioned in disease compartments; if that does not succeed, there will be no effect on both eyes. Either using a very hot medicine or iron.
Or using a flaming medicine, you take one thyme seed and crack it open on both sides then use an incision tool to create a hole for the pain near the temple until the position under the skin is reached.
Insert it under the skin until completely inserted, then tightly wrap it with a firm bandage and leave it for fifteen minutes; remove the thyme seed and allow the wound to heal for one or two days or three-quarters of a day, then apply.
Cover it with a qutn cloth soaked in oil until the position is healed, then treat it with plasters until it recovers if God wills; and you have done this using one of the incinerating medicines as mentioned in the eighteenth chapter on burning drupertions.
As for what is made of iron, apply this kind of plaster: The image depicting it shows...
The surgical plaster is called so because its head contains the setting for a splint and in the middle there is a small rod.
Then place it on the site of pain and hold your hand while you gently twist the iron rod, which will be half as much to burn off pus. Raise your hand to exert pressure on the vein that is causing bleeding from below, then drink a spoonful of salt in water and place it on the site for one-third of a day. Then endure the plaster with grease, and treat it until you recover, Insha'Allah (God willing).
And if you wish to cauterize this companion with the iron tip from the plaster and prevent bleeding in her non-marring wound, do so.
Chapter Four.
A malignant companion.
If the female patient is treated as we have mentioned in previous treatments and symptoms listed but there is no improvement, and you suspect a complication that we did not discuss in our first treatment with drugs or cauterization with fire. It was necessary to cover the surgical knife until it dried after learning on the site of pain with a line about half an inch long and leaving your hand once, then you squeeze it until the vein is cut off and becomes like a bone.
It was necessary for you to protect from contact with the jaw that moves while chewing, which can burn the muscle or nerve causing convulsions.
Be cautious and watch out for the bleeding from the vein that you cut through it, as in cutting it off its course. Especially for those who ignored what they were doing and not an experienced practitioner, leaving the work first.
The treatment of the vein's bleeding, as mentioned in its place from the book if Allah wills it, I saw this miracle that is not done by any surgeon.
I saw the patient's body resembling a fig in the middle of the head as we described and treated the wound until it healed if Allah wills it.
And if you want to use the tool we mentioned in Chapter of Blood Vessels with two knives, it is better than this and effective.
Chapter Five.
Surgery for ear pain.
If the earache occurs from a cold and is accompanied by drainage, then proceed with all treatments we mentioned in Parts One to Four, if the pain has not gone away after administering medication called 'the point.'
Then poke it after soaking the entire ear as if you were turning or wrapping around them all, in case they both hurt. Then go away a little from the origin of the ear after you have located 'the point' with a thread and each side has about ten points around or near them, then treat those spots until healed by God's will.
Chapter Six.
Surgery for strengthening.
The kind of weakness that you treat with a potion as I mentioned in the Disease Parts.
And avoid the kind that occurs from spasms and contractions of nerves.
When treating this kind of weakness with injections, enemas, and jalap, if your treatment did not succeed then the affliction should be taken out thrice a day. One at the ear's origin, the second a bit below its temple, and the third near the joint of the eyebrows.
Make the patient sit up against the affected side because relaxation occurs on that side which is correct.
Image showing the patient positioned with their head slightly turned towards one ear and the other near the temple, length equivalent to that of the eyebrow.
Lower your hand until you scrape halfway through the skin's thickness, which is a representation of an incision and this type of surgical instrument that was later presented as being slightly more delicate than it appears to you. The instrument must have a blade slightly thicker, then proceed to treat the location as you present it until healed by God's will.
Chapter Seven.
The chronic abscesses.
If the abscess became chronic and was treated as we have mentioned, but your treatment did not heal it and it is not a contagious fever for four days. On each part of the skull, as we have mentioned: one on top and another in the middle, and a third at the back that you present.
Describe what you are presenting, and it may also scrape the inside of your mouth if mentioned; then proceed as presented.
Chapter aturtle. Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis. Translation: Section Eight. Arabic textbook on surgery by Albucasis.
Forgetfulness.
The one who is suffering from epilepsy should first be given large doses of ipecacuanha and purified blood pills for the brain.
Then he shaves his entire head and wears a liniment pad as described in the article on plasters, applying it multiple times until he is relieved from pain.
Do that on the level I mentioned with my eye, and apply it as described in these three articles at the back of his head from the upper part to the neck.
Place a piece of fat between each article, and handle the procedure as instructed; in case of an increase in symptoms, it is likely that the condition has improved with the second article.
If there is an increase, treat with the fourth article until relief and then continue based on the image presented.
Chapter Nine.
For curing fever and relaxing all the body.
It is recommended to proceed with scalp purification using ipecacuanha and as we mentioned, then shave the patient's head, apply a liniment pad in the middle of the head and rub pills on every bone from the top to the back, continue based on the image presented.
On three ribs, the body naturally relaxes more than usual, and the patient was likely for this reason and the disease was strong and contained with four cups on his spine. I informed him until his skin burned more and raised your hand, then treat it as you present what he mentioned until God willing he recovers, the gauze is lemon-based.
The Tenth Chapter.
His intense agony.
It appears the pain in the patient who suffered from gallstones should first be alleviated with large jars and other treatments we mentioned earlier if the illness is severe and may require medication.
If it is a boy for whom medication isn't likely, work the purgative and cleaning drains of the brain after that for many days with improved nutrition.
Then shave his head and apply one cup in the middle of the forehead as presented, then another elsewhere on the body. On each of his head's crowns, the patient was strong and it may have been appropriate to apply cups as mentioned by your assistant with relaxation on ribs and spine lines; the gauze is lemon-based for the condition presented.
Indeed the ailment is in a boy, make the incision gently as shown in this image.
The Surgical Chapter Ten.
In Malnohia.
If the cause of Malnohia is wetness and a thick curd from Kayak Cheese as we mentioned in Mr. Falj's case.
The cause of Malnohia is a shift towards blackness and the patient's body being saturated with excess moisture, leading to brain matter that cannot be separated as shown in the section on division.
Then cut the patient's skull, then create a rounded bone cushion and place it on top of his head with the patient lying down flatly holding each side and take one pound of aged sheep yogurt.
Then warm it over fire until lukew cupping is likely if inserted, then pour out into the circular area of his head and leave until cooled down; do this to the patient once a week with careful covering until he recovers by God's will.
And if it drips excessively so that you cannot hold the scalpel but rather shake it, this type of incision moistens the brain evenly.
Then he carries a lantern filled with cotton or goose fat.
Chapter Twelve.
In the eye, water flows out.
If you notice from the beginning that water flows out of the eye with any signs mentioned in the section on sudden febrile illness, then let his head and neck be washed free of all moisture and rub them in the bath over their lymhemic secretions for days.
Then he rubs a cloth over his head and wets it in the middle of his head, then applies two more on his temples if water flows out from both eyes at the beginning or from one side if it is just one eye.
Then cut off all oranges and vessels under the skin where the hair grows, making them lengthwise across the temples to stop bleeding.
I saw something about it, cut on the spot with any treatment you can offer and come to reason in the vessel and cut them off and prevent bleeding.
And let him be rubbed twice on the neck under both collarbones.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the case of chronic boils.
If the eyes' sweat is chronic and has been from pustules and hairs seen on the head from outside of the skull, and it was confirmed that this was due to a large cold blister-like growth in the sweet gum known as 'fakoh' which she described at the beginning with water. Two [blisters] on the forehead and two on each temple, undernecups of bone; if there is an increase in 'fakoh' blister on either side from the edge of the eye socket to a small plug.
The Fourteenth Chapter. (Note: Albucasis did not use chapter titles, this would be added by modern editors.)
In the nose's nostril. (This could refer to a location for examination or treatment in the context of medical procedures described in Albucasis' work on surgery.)
If it was treated as we mentioned in the division and did not improve after three nights then he vomited and expelled his middle 'fakoh' blister with olive oil plug. (This sentence refers to a medical procedure possibly involving purging or evacuation of an internal condition, likely described by Albucasis.) Then 'fakoh' on the eyebrows, slightly above and under the hair, keeping it from cutting the veins; this is an image of the incision. (This could describe a specific technique or placement for surgical incisions as described by Albucasis.)
Chapter Fifteen: Extraction of Foreign Bodies from Wounds.
In the case of relaxation of eyelid lids.
If the eyelid lid relaxes due to a disease or excessive tear secretion, use this crescent-shaped hook.
If there are a few excess tears over the eyelids, pull out two on each side away from the temples and let the length of each be equal to the upper lid.
Do not overdo it with the hook, only to the extent that one-third of the skin is burned and the shape of the hook on this aspect.
Chapter Sixteen: Extraction of Foreign Bodebodies from Wounds.
In the case of relaxation of eyelid lids.
If the eyelashes are turned inward into the eye socket, there are two types of hooks to use it. Either the hook with fire or the hook with burning medicine, either use a hot hook before allowing eyelashes to grow in if they were shed until it grows long and flat.
Once the eyelashes have grown, they become itchy and move until they grow back if they are shed until they grow long and flat. Then remove the lump at its root with a needle in your hand, then learn on the eye lid to trace the shape of a sheet of paper A4 size.
The mark is placed near the eyebrow, then a cotton soaked in egg white or silkworm fluid is placed underneath the eye, and this compresses the affected area.
Then it is shaved in the manner I instructed, a little bit at a time over many sessions until the skin surface resembles an asa tree's leaf and the characteristic sign of successful work becomes evident with healed eyelids and raised hair from the eyeball edge.
Raise your hand at that time and leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball soaked in olive oil until the scab falls off, then treat with compresses as necessary until healed by God's will; this usually results in hair regrowth after resting period and eyelid recovery.
Return to that spot as you did initially, and the hair in the lower eyelid will grow until it returns to its natural position without interfering with the eyeball; as for using cauterizing drugs, they command an inflammaturm to leave the hairs alone.
Then, create a paste from asa tree resin; take familiar soap and unburnt gum arabic equivalent to the weight of one or two dirhams each and grind them together thoroughly quickly so they don't dry out. Then he simplifies it by placing on a cup that is made of paper and puts it on one or two eyelids, then places under the eye a quince soaked in egg white and placed on a stone.
Then you put your little finger on the medicine and rub it a bit, moving it as long as the disease feels the medicine like fire until the solvent finds the resin in the drug; then move the medicine with your finger if the solver has become sticky or wash the eye with water. If the solver evaporates, remove the powder from the eye and rub with the finger.
You observe that the eye has riseby much as in heating by fire or burning, so redress it with medicine where it did not work and until your job is done and the eye is cured, then place a quince soaked in butter on it until it rises away completely.
Then you treat it with cataplasm, yellow or otherwise until healed; when working be extremely careful to prevent the medicine falling into the eye and after a few days fear hair in the eye.
Apply the medicine to the place where the inflammebacteria has settled, specifically as you did first, then treat it until healed; this is a picture of sheet paper.
Be aware that people's eyes may vary in size, so measure accordingly; not by concealing the path to correctness on one who has experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
In the Nasoric method displayed in eye corner.
If the Nasoric treatment mentioned in disease measurements does not heal you, then it should be applied to this condition.
The disease commands you to place your head in a pillow and grip it with both hands, holding the chin tightly so that it does not move or bite upward.
Then place a swolebrushed eyelid in the eyeball or in the lashes of his eyes, then cover it with the cloth that appears herein.
The nasal pipe of the eagle beak is a sealed tube from one end and, if you wish, open at the other; or it can be muted like a reed flute. This enclosed tube is deemed superior for your task, by God's will.
Then the nason tube is pressed if it is open and a cord is pulled from it, or if not open, it is opened and the clot is extracted, then at that time hot water is placed on it so that you can grasp it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
Further away from you, from the eye to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not go wrong or the patient gets worried and the tube falls into the eyelid fat causing it, if in the first junction it reaches the bone, otherwise reset the tube a second time if needed.
Leave him for three days, then carry on treating with a black cohosh bandage until he recovers; if it passes forty days and does not improve, load him with potent medicine continuously until the bone protrudes and remove it as soon as possible when mentioned in his doorway.
The next time the nason is mentioned, skillfully prepare its position and place delicate gauze in this space as indicated by his image.
And apply in it a weight of two grains of molten lead, grasp the gauze firmly to ensure proper immobilization and prevent the paralyzed patient from shifting the liquid metal into his eye; it is advised that you place on the patient's eye a milk-soaked cotton pad or one soaked in water.
Indeed, the lead burns the position of the tonsil and clears it wonderfully; thus, the clearing of the tonsil by means of medicine is not necessary if one uses the hole in the nose and drains the tonsil to the nasal canal as soon as possible at its most critical point.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the incision of the gums.
Often, the gum recession called "gum disease" occurs, especially in children's gums; it often happens if this recession is treated as we have mentioned in the division so that the treatment does not heal severe scarring with a small surgical knife on this image.
Her hollow is placed on the scalpel skin and quickly inserted into the same recess, until the knife reaches the depth of the recess, then it's treated with cauterization to be relieved as Allah wills.
Chapter Nineteen.
In the tonsil that occurs in the mouth.
If the tonsil appears at its root or on the jawbones or in the alveolar ridges and swells, bursts, and causes pus from a ruptured tonsil; then it is not healed by treatment as we have mentioned so that bandaging should be applied to the extent possible on the tonsil.
Then a surgeon is inserted into the naseb (hole) of the nasour, holding your hand until the protected iron reaches one or the other side. Then you do this once or twice and then treat it as we have mentioned for the treatment to heal if God wills.
If the material has come to a halt and is clear, there should be no problem in exposing the place and removing the bad bone according to what will arise on its face if God wills.
Chapter Twenty.
The cessation of the pus and the loosened latham.
If the latham has softened before moisture and pus movement occurs, treated it with medicine and did not heal after extracting a bone from your skull as was suggested then cover the wound with the dressing that appears after this once you have applied the drainage tube.
The dressing is inserted with urgency and holds your hand briefly until the ailment feels the heat of the fire has reached to the base of the skull, then lifts your hand back and re-applies the dresser several times as desired before filling its mouth with saltwater.
The dressing is held and thrown, if the moving skull confirms and the loosened latham becomes severe while drying out the impure moisture.
Chapter on Surgery and Twenty-One.
In the headache of the tooth.
If the toothache is from cold or if it has worms and does not heal with medicinal ointments, then on its two sides either one side by fat and the other by fire.
As for the fat, it is to take cow fat and melt it in an iron bowl or a wooden bowl then to take a piece of cotton cloth and twist it on one side of the sore then dip it into the melted fat and place it on the affected tooth with urgency and secure it until it cools.
Then return it repeatedly until the heat reaches the tooth's origin, and if desired, dip a sponge or cotton cloth in cold fat and place it on the affected tooth with urgency and cover it with shielded iron until the fire reaches the bottom of the toaster.
And as for it by fire, it is to enter a lead or iron tube with some plaster lining so that the heat does not reach the mouth of the affected area, then moisten the wad that comes out and place it on the same tooth with urgency and hold your hand until the plug cools. Do this repeatedly.
Indeed, the pain subsides either on that day with its eye or on another, and it is proper that upon this he fills his sore in the mouth with good butter and holds it for an hour then throws it away; this is a picture of the clyster.
It is made with either side as possible, and this is a picture of the tube.
The Second and Twentiamoisture Removal: This section discusses methods for moisture removal... (Translation continues based on context).
In his intestines: Refers to the condition within an individual's intestines or a description thereof in a medical context. (Exact translation may vary depending on full context from Albucasisâ text).
If the intestines are of pear and cold humors, and have not been aided by medicine to ripen, they desire rapid maturation, hence he depicts an evacuated tube (clyster) from both ends. This likely refers to Albucasis' illustration or description for treating certain intestinal conditions using clysters as part of the therapy.
Let the smoke exit from another part of the body and place it safely on the same lump twice, if needed until reaching the depths of the swelling; then make the clyster large enough to cover the tumor. This passage appears to describe a procedure in Albucasis' surgery where fumigation is used as an intervention for treating bodily masses or tumors, and it might involve repeated administration or adjustment depending on the situation of the lump (tumor).
Then leave it for a third of the days, and apply an oil-soaked cotton over butter until inflamed by fire; then treat with plasters and ointments until recovery or as God wills. This segment describes postoperative care following surgery in which fomentation is applied to control swelling and promote healing. It implies that treatment should continue with various medicinal applications, possibly reflecting a standard therapeutic regimen for the era of Albucasis' practice.
Chapter 32.
In the throat from inflammamo on the voice and shortness of breath.
If moisture accumulates in the lung and especially if accompanied by a cold, it is necessary to purge the disease first with suitable medications, then boil a hen at the corner of the river near its source position at a lower point.
Beware of reaching the throat and not burning half of your skin, then boil another hen at the joint of the neck in a separate hot spot, being sure that the vessel is metal-like.
Then treat it as described until healed by the will of God.
Chapter 42.
In the throat from lung disease and sneezing.
If sneezing and lung disease are from cold humidity and it is not infected, fever or diarrhea and the illness is chronic, boil two hens over hot spots in low and empty locations, then another hen between the breasts at the center of the chest.
And the vessel is metal-like as described, and if you wish let it be incised with a boiled hen called the point that has been introduced, along with its image in piercing ears pain points ranging from thirty to near them.
Then treat it as indicated by what is mentioned until he recovers, and a shoe with three spikes has been made on this image, which the man urgpress to use because you can punch three times in one go using it, and this is an image of the clyssus.
Section Five and Twenty.
In man's groin.
If the head of the ligament has slipped due to moist retraction or if it was not secured when healing until it becomes usual, then re-displacement will occur at minimum movement as we saw in the image. It should be that the flap is retracted first. Then the wound is scooped on the back or on the side and lift the skin that lies inside the groin with your left hand if the joint has slipped inward.
Then shields the clyssus with two spikes as depicted here in this image.
Then the skin is punched with it until it stretches to the other side and the form of man becomes four holes, a shoe with three spikes may be used then and there will be four holes in the man's body when using it, and the spikes will be on the skin surface.
This is the picture of the catheter with three channels.
An additional eight threads are added to this number, then carried on the spoon with salted pills, and applied to the affected area without moving the limb until it strengthens; if there is a slipping upwards towards an inflated bladeropt you must add another thread.
Drinking one good cane or many thin threads loosens the joint and moisture leaves and cures the illness.
The Sixth Chapter Twenty.
In the stomach area.
If the illness occurs in the stomach with chills and excessive moisture until it is purged from his body, and if there are frequent diarrhea and bed rest has not been effective, then the patient should be lifted onto their back, lengthen their legs, and bind three threads. Place a cannula under the chest with a spooned needle and two threads below each side of the single thread until the threads form triangles spaced apart, so they come together if raised and the depth is one-third of skin thickness, maintaining the shape of the threads.
On this picture and on this plate without more.
And if you wish to insert one large capsule in the middle of the stomach on this picture.
And the cautery used to cut this single capsule will be circular on this picture.
The stomach is cut in an opening from which a piece of this capsule was removed, and you must learn on the stomcu how to mark with thread where you want to sew then cauterize it using a needle-shaped cautery until healed.
Chapter Seven Twenty.
In the cold liver capsule.
If the liver presents pain from coldness and wetness or a strong wind until it leaves its natural mood excessively, then treat the illness as we mentioned in division five shall not succeed. The patient should be placed on their back, and you must mark three capsules with thread of this shape and size using the liver as seen underne. Below the ribs where it ends at the human joint.
Each capsule and the one before it should be placed on the finger's fleshy part, and the capsule along the body straight without holding onto the cautery too tightly.
Let it be as much as possible to cauterize half of the sweat from the skin, and if the disease stands on its feet, then if not standing put his legs stretched out and raise his arms, this is an image of kneading.
You can cure these ailments with the surgical kneading board if you have experience and practice in the craft, avoiding injury to your patient by firstly scraping all of his skin before proceedanguishing his abdomen until reaching the intestines; for there is thin skin here.
Chapter Eight and Twenty.
In the liver and gall bladder using a tool called 'kia'.
If the liver shows discharge and you want to learn if that tumor is in the hepatic lobe or atrophic, when it's in the hepatic lobe, find the disease heavy and painful beyond measure.
If it is in the atrophic liver, there was intense pain and I saw that some doctors were treating it by making the disease stand on its feet then learn where the swelling occurs with a thread.
Then protect the kneading board from fire and the kneading boards similar to millstones; this is her image. He fills it with one application until the skin burns all over and ends up at the scar, then he drains it completely before treating it as a regular wound so that it heals.
This type of incision should only be used by those who are experienced in the medical profession and have encountered these diseases through experience, then they present it as such before leaving it to the best experts.
The ninth and twentieth chapter.
In a blister.
He mentioned the initial sutures for cold blisters, using strings from the Zerawand variety and taking one long piece as a standard length, then coating it with oil and charring it in fire. Then he makes one incision between the attachment of the throat and two small incisions without piercing, slightly towards the area under the beard, and then two large incisions above the glands between the third and fourth ribs.
Two more incisions between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly towards the back, another incision in the middle of the chest, and one above the liver. Then three sutures from behind, one between the shoulders and two on either side below the solid line that is near to the incision already made.
It is not fitting for your hand to penetrate deeply, but rather on the surface of the skin, and some precursors have mentioned that there are people who use a tool made of iron nearly straight in shape to cover it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the same lump.
The duration exits as we mentioned in the liver tumor, and through this tube in your hand either the patient dies from his hour or shows no fear at all.
Chapter Thirty-three.
For treatment of abscesses.
If the treatment of abscesses that we have mentioned, which is through division, does not succeed in your case on any of its three aspects (either one or two or all), then make it into three to four pieces and place them along the tumor.
For the liver lobes that present in shape and there is between each lobe by at most a thickness of the finger or slightly more, and the tool for the liver resembles what we have mentioned in our book about the livee: do not penetrate deeply with your hand and place it on the surface of the tumor.
Another face in the attachment, raising the skin where the diseased process ends and raising the skin overlying it there where the left attachment of the disease ends, with your raised skin on the body's width to allow the pouches to be placed along the body.
Then, Albucasis and his assistant enter the abdomen safely until they apply the skin from the other side, then exit the catheter to be four pouchnuts, if you wish to sew with another catheter of three saffidiuns.
Then, the placement of the pouchenut is treated after it has been left to swell for several days until it provides relief from further treatment.
The Surgical Section and Thirty-One.
In the bathing room.
The pouchenut is beneficial in bathing, especially if the masseur treats it with the therapy we mentioned in division IV and does not relieve your condition, then sew four pouchenuts around the genitals, waist, and one on the abdomen.
Another pouchenut on the liver, one over the disease site and two behind his back between the folds of one near the chest and another near the abdence; the depth of the pouchenut is close to the thickness of the skin, then leave it open to swell for a long time.
Do not neglect to treat after the appropriate care has been provided, so that those concerned may recover quickly; the image of the knife incision in which the back is cut with it being a metal one as previously depicted and with a lemon-like shape.
Section Two Hundred Thirty.
In the two feet and two legs.
If it has swolculed in the sole and filled with yellow fluid, one should incise on the top of the foot at the knuckle between the metatarsal bones.
Raise your hand with the knife and do not shake it, then lift your hand without bending at the elbow, as it will draw out the yellow fluid and the incision is made in this manner.
Then incise on both legs, making two incisions on each leg: one at the sharp edge of the knife from the main incision and another along the length of the leg under the knee joint, with one above and one below it towards the middle of the thigh, making two parallel cuts on each shin.
Leave the incision open without immediate care to draw out more fluid, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter Three and Thirty.
In the bladder.
If diarrhee persists due to cold and humidity, weakening the vital forces of digestion in the stomach and intestines, if these are relieved by enema therapy but the patient does not recover, I consider it likely that there is an excess of moisture in his bladder. In the bladder, introduce a spherical catheter with four holes around the tip and fine needles attached to it for administering injections above the rectum on a large or double cloth cover.
I have seen the excess of moisture and illness being likely due to that, so treatments for the bladjar with injections on both sides and possibly two small ones near the abdomen; this is a successful treatment without error if God wills it.
Chapter Forty-Three.
In the bladder cystitis.
If the bladder cystitis is chronic or occasional, and caused by thick cold mucus or damaged fluids, if relieved as we have mentioned in division but the treatment does not succeed, suspect three treatments with small cloth covers on the lower back under the chest slightly triangular.
"Abdominal incision below the belly button with two fingers, and if suspected that his organ has cooled and his food does not digest, and his face is pale and sickly, perform a large abdominal fumigation as soon as possible. "And also on his gums with a needle-like instrument and leave the cavity open for some time, then treat him until he recovers if God wills.
"Chapter five and thirty.
"In the throat.
"After cutting them, if the ulcer has cut through the gum suture resembling a thread then insert it with the same type of saliva and use your hand until it reaches the nostril from which blood is drained; do this once or twice.
"The suture was large and foul-smelling in each one, treated as we described then managed with what suits the bandages until recovered; if a larger treatment on cotton is needed to alleein the mouth, I advised accordingly based on experience.
"Chapter six and thirty.
"In the nose cavity that is in the palate area.
"If the inflammation does not require a surgical intervention and incision as described in its location, then if it heals on one side of the nose, if pus or harmful moisture drains from it, first you should measure it with a fine needle.
Then you would know the depth of the ulcer with a probe, then suture the one that is similar to a furrow, and put it into a bag in the same manner as the fistula, where the instrument enters the ulcer and the container holding the probe and again on top until those damaged bodies have burned once or twice or three times according to your need.
If there is a large vein or artery, if the fistula leads to the urinary blader or rectum.
Preserve all these locations, but do so only if the fistula is in an unobstructed position and you have assessed that it can be accessed, then treat the location until cured, seal off the site and remove any materials left there for a period of time before assuming healing has occurred.
And if the materials have not been removed, then know that it is obstructed or in a deep ulcerated area or nearing such, as mentioned in its location.
The Seventh and Thirty-Third Chapter.
In the bladder lining (urothelium).
If it occurs in the bladvee and causes chills or a strong odor due to that, then treat this disease by suturing on both sides of the bladder with the described probe as mentioned in its section, possibly using three such probes within the same meal, resulting in them being reported.
Chapter Eighty-Three and Thirty.
Regarding the Alkaline fluid.
If there is an issue with the alkaline fluid, characterized by lethargy and fever due to excess heat and humidity until diarrhea does not cling to the feces in the lower part of the bladprise where hairs begin from the right side of the bladprise and others from its left.
The duration after the alkaline fluid on either side should reach one cubit and lower diarrhea to the chest or two if it progresses, with a protracted course.
Chapter Eighty-Three and Thirty.
Regarding the fluid of the heart.
If there is a material from the cold and humidity that completely overcomes the string, corrupts its essence, and weakens or causes pain to its veins, it should be cleared three times around the bladprise as previously mentioned in the Alkaline fluid section. The clearance should occur on the cotton below the chest or two times, with a protracted course.
Chapter Forty-Four.
Regarding the dislocation of the hip.
Moist winds may result in the hip dislocating out of place and its sign that one leg is longer than the other if they press against each other, indicating a gap where the dislocation occurred; it is necessary to clear the condition on the hip itself by forming a circular incision.
After learning with the brush about the truth, which revolves so that the same truth falls in the center of the circle and the pumpkin shown in figure K within the stomach is not faked by three kyats of large olive oil bucket.
He provided figure K with a depth equivalent to the fullness of the skin and treated it until healing occurred, if God wills.
The surgical chapter forty-four.
In figure K of the nostratur.
If pain occurs in the hip joint and the cause is coldness and dampness, treat the ailment as we mentioned in sectional division; if it does not improve and swelling persists, it should be facilitated by softening pectin or rhubarb powder.
Then apply two applications either on figure K with a hot drug or on fire, and the third application where it burns on itself to the hip joint is in the shape of three triangles on this image.
It has a suitable depth and after every other figure, it is to the thickness of a finger's pad; the pumpkin is olive oil-like, with a figure in the center on its own head that causes four figures if desired, or follow the circle shown in figure K which extracts one degree of hip joint.
The circle encompasses all the tendons and burns through all of the skin, this is the nature of a man in black ink if the pain is limited to the joint itself and does not extend to the shank or leg.
It extends to the shank and leg, two cups on the shank in the position indicated by your ailment with pain therein, and cups above the veins leading four fingers towards the unnatural point; the incision is straight and shall be as deep as skin burns only.
And if the pain extends towards four fingers of the hand, where you are indicated by a drop point or more, if that is necessary, and there is cupping below the ankle extending towards the leg, one straight incision will be there.
And ensure that the cups maintain their nature to a point where they might burn nerves or large blood vessels, leading to a severe ailment or urgency.
And in two cases observed where it was above the veins and extended to the ankle, reaching up to the toe nails being buried and rotting away, resulting in gangrene of the entire foot followed by diarrhea and death, thus both pains were characteristic of this condition with obvious signs.
Albucasis described some of the wise men at his court as making a goblet from iron with a diameter of half a cubit, and when at its rim it is on the thickness of an almond's shell or slightly less, within that goblet there are two other cups.
The distance between each cup is about the length of an index finger, and the cups are open on both sides with a height of one or two fingers, and they have handles made of iron as determined in the cups, and this was his image.
Then he immersed it in fire until it burned and scattered the ashes, then placed it on his arm or thigh to rest properly with three tight bands wrapped at once, and left it for three days which are bandaged with fat and left open.
This kind of tube, which we used for suction and its appearance and to allee a case from what could calm it except that none like the best instruments on those who endure it and are afflicted by it at its location.
As for the animal treated with burning medicine, it is to make two crescent-shaped bowls in which lead from blowing tubes or iron can fall.
They have their margins raised to the height of two fingers or so, and the distance between them is the thickness of a finger; they are open at the bottom and closed on top, with some being attached to each other in this image.
Then they are placed on the thigh and leg correctly, and you tie them with your right hand; then a small amount of water is inserted between the two circles, lit by a low fire for an hour. You hold it tightly in sand for an hour, allowing the wound to absorb and then burn it completely as if it were a flame.
Then you extinguish the poultice, raise your hand with a tool to scrape off all the water from the thigh using fresh water; then leave it for three days and cover it with fat until the burned wound scab goes away, after which you let it rest without treatment, and if healed properly, he claims complete relief.
Then it is treated with bandages until healed, the pain spreading to the thigh or leg; made in a pattern that holds water as was done for the thigh, known as concentrated water and proven in the treatise on drug remedies.
Takes from salted malaga and unlit rosin one piece each, crushes them and places them in a new jar that has been pierced at the bottom with one small hole through which moisture enters, and another melted jar is placed undernecupper.
The salted malaga and rosin are immersed in pure water, thoroughly mixed by hand until they dissolve, and the jar is left until most of the liquid has drained at the bottom into the melted jar; then all that water is collected and applied to another rosin and fresh malaga.
Then the force of the purgative is greatly active in many aspects of medicine and affects all organs as if doing fiery work, and it also acts like thapsia resin, honeyed milkweed juice, and rosin with emollient.
Gallenus told a story of a man from the footmen who was treated for testicular pain and severe fever, claim.he did not need any treatment other than that and he got cured in one time.
Until he enters a portable bath and exits, having been cleansed, then takes the green plaster when there is no fresh green material to take the dry; be blessed with it being kneaded well with some fat on his calf where the pain or in the thigh or behind.
It tightens and leaves for about three hours or as long as the patient feels tiredness from the cauterization; then enters the bath if his body is sweaty, so he enters the pool and the pain goes away and he recovers with God's permission; but if not healed, repeat the plaster after twelve days again.
He recovers, if God wills it; know that one should not use this medicine after evacuating the body, and Dioscorides mentioned that hemp oil applied to menstrual blood is beneficial from it.
He will be on this condition, takes hair in a fatty ointment to apply and places it where the deep place is between thumb and wrist from the palm side so that near the wrist; then take hemp oil as close as possible.
He heats it to the point of glowing then places it on wool and leaves until extinguished; then take off what remains, which still does that until sensation reaches through the arm to the calf where resides the pain with God's permission for the animal called hemp.
Chapter Two and Forty-Four.
In the headache of the back.
He may present with a headache on the back for many reasons such as falling, hitting or excessive vomiting and so forth. It is only from cold and moist material that it falls into this category alone.
It is from cold material that it should fall after vomiting with sputum, and tend to rest on the back where the headache spans three rows across the middle of the belly itself after learning its position by the string in each row five or more kitties apart depending on the likelihood of illness and severity as you see.
It will be with three kitties or four, using a nail point and center punch in the picture.
Chapter Three and Forty-Four.
In the beginning of a rib fracture.
This case often presents in young children as a sign that they experience shortness of breath while moving and exercising, finding one or more rib fractures at the end of their back.
If you see this and wish to capture it, use a hoop that is circular as shown in the picture. If you take the sutures on each side of the fracture with a needle, and if desired, wrap it around the bone fragments using two or three points spaced close to each other, then treat the position until healed as we have mentioned.
And preserve the use of the scalpel on the bone that is from tearing the nerve, ...
Section Four and Forty.
In the scalpel, nicks and joints ailments.
If joint ailments are due to cold temperatures affecting any body part, if the pains occurred in both feet as is usual for physicians to call that specific scalpel condition.
If the cold causing scalpel condition is being treated with our mentioned method, and if the pains do not subside then the surgery proceeds and wraps it after cleaning around the ankle joints many times, and the hoop used is medium-sized as shown in the image.
If there is a need to puncture on the foot, then pains extend up to the ankles or the upper joints and this often displays itself by wrapping three times with hoop from each side using this medium-saturated olive oil hoop.
Indeed, if one needs more than this particular wine and does not dig deep into it but only to the level of skin thickening, then the ailments ascend to the shoulders or back, use what we mentioned in chapter regarding that.
The diseases in the hands were only swollen around the knuckles, as if two rows revolved; but those on the fingers became nodules at each joint point and on the skin of the hand, then the ailments ascended after days to the elbows or forearms.
As for all, the ailment does not cease without proper care and taking medication; best nutrition and emptying bile will heal with this wine if God wills it.
Chapter fifty-four.
In chapter Kia (the fifth).
If a pustule in the hoof recedes and drops some abscess with exudate to the sole, and it is an initial case, then one should command the disease to abstain from eating that day and use our prescribed medications until the moisture dries up.
Then he would be compressed between your hands on his back and commanded to hold himself until the abscess or pus emerges, then you should push it away with a finger of yours and learn by the marking under the fistula at the tibia bone as a semicircle sign pointing upwards.
Then he protected her wound with the dressing mentioned above.
Then Tamara removed the bandage and put it back into its pouch, then placed her foot on a stool so that the dressing was not visible; she wrapped the wound with another piece of cloth and applied a new splint underneebox.
Finally, she held the dressing on her chest with both hands and stood upright holding it until her arm is fully healed or when it needs to be redressed again if not before.
Maintain the dressing in place while you sit upright, as an incident may occur that could cause harm to the wound either resulting in death or a severe injury; know that if your arm has not fully healed when it should have, your work was unsuccesscu, and be sure that for children of gentleness appropriate to their age group and adults appropriately.
Then, after three days treat the wound with a turpentine mixture until it becomes dry and clean; then apply all bandages until it heals completely, leaving the injury on its back for forty days before closing the suture.
It is fitting that the food should be a measure of healing two parts for him, so that when he laughs and rises up, if after forty days he wishes to perform it again, he can employ tight straps for another forty days, then his weakness and fullness from food and drink and loud cries will decrease.
If this treatment is used thus and is entirely healed, as God wills, I will mention the treatment of coughing by incision through its door if God wills, and what concerns the split that occurs in the entire abdebut was novice and did not want to increase the splits from tight bindings according to its capacity. Let not a third of the skin be burnt, then treat it as we have mentioned so that it does not increase if God wills; some prognoses state that the split is closed with a triangular patch on this image.
After learning on the split, the line that appears on the upper side of the split and the other line to below is one threaded needle in the middle with a single thread and the first line was easier and better if God wills.
Chapter Sixty Four.
In the abscess.
If it happens in any of the body parts as a result of a fall or a blow to the joint and the pain persists for a long time, and if treatment with medication does not help, then one should tie up at the point using a splinting splint according to the size of each part (big, small, weak, strong).
It allows the pain and abscess to be free from the first part, otherwise continue with it as these pains usually pass on to something close by, so it should follow up until healed.
Chapter Sixty Four. (Although this is not a translation but simply stating the chapter number in English.)
In the wound. (This refers to an injury or cut on the body, indicating where the action should be taken as per the text.)
But those with bleeding greatly benefit from splinting, especially the type of abscess that has previously been treated with aloes and black sulfur. (This statement provides specific guidance on using a splint for treating different types of wounds or abscesses, mentioning the beneficial effects for patients experien. It also indicates which kind of treatment was applied before.)
If you want to look at it and the abscess is new (recent) and has been treated as mentioned in the division, but did not cease or stop and weakened on the disease so that decay overtook all his body, then let him have a head bandage of five strips. (This segment provides specific advice for treating an advanced case of abscess where previous treatments failed to yield results. It suggests using a headband with five strips as a measure to control the progression of the disease.) One in the middle of the forehead, two below it towards the edge at the end of the hair, and two on each temple near the corner of the eyebrow, push gently with your finger so that it affects the bone gradually.
It rises from scales that facilitate the expulsion of thick vapors, and is also made into a poultice on the same part where treatment is proceeding; as for if sores have persisted on the wound with obvious signs appearing, it should be treated with the poultices we previously mentioned in the head. A poultice on the side of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the neck ribs, three on the back at the base of the spine and one above it on the same table, and two on each leg on both sides of each knee. Two on each ankle, one on each calf and two on the knees, two on the shoulder blades, two over the chest, and a poulture applied to all joints of his fingers and feet as well as each toe.
"Save the nerve at the back of the heels so that they do not consume them, and press with a knife on the outer bone of the ankle and also on the mouth of the stomach and others on the liver; know that whenever you pressed it was beneficial.
"Know that the disease does not find a pain for it as found by the true one in order to have its body numbed, and it is appropriate that the pressure be big or small according to the organs and joints depending on what is offered from the characteristics of spices.
"Then the physician treats with ground clove and honey, along with other treatabas till heal if Allah wills.
"The eighth chapter and forty-fourth verse." (Note: This is a section title from the Quran.)
"In the physician's anesthetic when a body part numbs, treat with medicines and ointments and plasters if it does not heal itself, then apply ointment according to what deserves the bone of the part or its smallness and let it be softened in the skin slightly.
"Then treat with the plaster till it heals, and may press for a numbing that is shown to the hand and arm on ribs where the nerve moves that limb at the anesthetic." (Note: This instruction appears to be incomplete or contextually unclear as typically in medical procedures, one does not "press" an anesthetic; they might apply it.)
Without exception, it was Albucasis who performed dissections of the limbs and the nerves that move the body.
Chapter Ninety-four and Forty.
In this surgery.
If a pimple progresses and does not improve with the techniques of medicine, then I would make a small incision there on the skin as deep as to reach the depth of scabies until it turns white and changes color.
Then it is treated with lime plaster mixed with alum powder, blood of sheep or pigeon droppings from one part each; all are blended and spread over a cloth piece then applied to the affected area and kept in place until healed.
Chapter Fifty-six.
In his cancer.
If the cancer is at an early stage and he aims to contain it with a circular wooden ring about this size, some scholars have mentioned that Albucasis placed a heavy lead piece in its center and I do not see myself achieving that because I expect it to leakage; however, I have observed it multiple times.
The correct method is to contain it with a circular ring as we mentioned or use numerous dressings.
Chapter Ninety-five and Fifty.
In the Dabila.
If someone at Dabila occurs and is delayed in maturation either by the active bleeding or by the duration of the illness, whether they are an old man with little blood or just over time, if one wants to hasten the maturation of the Dabeba, use a large number of small pills.
Then leave it, and she will hasten in maturation so that you have coagulated the blood with a dried fig paste which formed this image of her.
And apply it in the middle of Dabila until the skin breaks and the coagulation is what descends down so that the scabs ease off then treat it as needed until recovery.
The second chapter fifty.
In the stomach eating.
Food is but a disease that seeks to consume the body as one consumes dry wood by fire, and I saw the food in a place likely to burn with severe intense burning from iron pills both small and large according to what suits the location where the food resides.
Then treat it from all sides until the disease consumes everything and nothing of its original remains, then leave for three days on top of the coagulated sites with pulverized sulfur mixed with oil until all scabs peel off completely and all diseases are gone.
Then treat it with plant-grown bandages for meat; after three days, the meat has grown a healthy plant without any rot in it, and otherwise return the animal to what remained of the spoiled positions, and you can treat eating disorders with strong medicine.
He performs a quick operation at the fire station and mentioned treating it with strong medicine in division, which he took from there when she needed it.
Chapter Three and Fifty.
In my upside-down and non-upside-down bandages.
It happens often in these two steps that something harsh prevails over the man, either by fire or by strong hot water on both sides.
As for burning, it is to cover the cuff-like hollow made of iron encircling around the pin from all sides and then pouring hot water on the bandage before you hold the cuff around the pin until the cuff reaches the depth of the pin.
Leave it wrapped in fatty dough kneaded with salt for three days, then apply a natural bandage to the wound and leave the dressing on overnight; he will rise from his symptoms, then treat the location of the injury with plant-grown bandages until recovery is achieved, as they were non-upside down.
Often, on the body's surface, especially on hands and feet, it is advisamo to use a tube made of copper or iron or an eagle's feather quill, lowering it onto the nail or thorn then receiving water quickly through the tube.
Your hand holds and you manage it with a slight twinkle of your fingers affecting the tube's base at the thorn or nail, finding a direct path for the hot water to reach the root of the splinter, while the infection is slightly soothed by the rapid infusion of water.
Then it is left to fall off with its roots, so you do one at a time until all that are in the body come out and then treat their locations after they have grown out as the meat from bandages.
Chapter Four Hundred Fifty.
In the fingertip.
If one has a splinter from cold or fever or other, it is recommended to place four quills or five on the back between each quill and in the chest cavity. And on the affected cavity with almond oil, the splinter warms and accelerates the maturation of the cold disease.
Chapter Five and Fifty.
In case of accidental blisters in the body.
Should pustules appear on the body, which are of an impure and thick material that is cold in nature, it should be noted first to scrape off each blister gently with a piece of linen cloth. One side can be heated by fire or a long candle wick, or using a magnifying glass lens to warm the area around them.
The pustules should be scraped off at the onset of their eruption, so that the causative agent does not increase or spread further. It is only after thorough cleansing and draining of the affliction with a syringe that the illness can heal itself.
Chapter Six and Fifty.
In case of bleeding caused by cutting the vein.
Bleeding often occurs from a vein that has been severed due to an injury exposing itself or as a result of cutting through a tumor or tissue near it causing obstruction.
If someone experiences this, quickly press with your fingertnails on the vein and hold firmly until blood is stopped under your nail, ensnaring no further escape. Then place a few small to large Zaitouni olives in the fire and let them smoke heavily before smoking it over the affected area repeatedly until the surrounding skin becomes severely inflamed.
Then you take one either small or large according to the wound and its location where the suture was placed, and after loosening your finger slightly, hold the thread on the same vein so that it cuts off when pulled tightly.
The needle popping out when lifting your finger from the vein and quickly grabbing another suture from the same basket, continue doing so one after the other until the blood stops flowing.
And the nerve does not burn, ensuring that another ulceration occurs from a different wound, and be aware that if blood leaks from the vein, it cannot stop unless by one of four methods as we said, either with thread or tape if there is none. It is if its tip shrinks and blood stops, either tie it with a tight knot or apply medication which has the purpose of stopping the bleeding and firmly securing it on the suture.
However, if it is attempted to be stopped by clamping or applying pressure and such methods, then it will not stop except in the extreme case of lack of surgical intervention, presentation without a doctor's presence, or absence of medicine as we described placing the foul-smelling finger on the wound itself.
He presses it firmly so that the blood is stopped, and a lump forms above the wound and on the vein, and applying cold water continuously hardens the blood, causing it to thicken, stop, and burst. During this time, one should examine what remedies are needed from herbs or drugs.
Chapter Two.
In the Chin, Cleft, Fistula, and Surgical Treatments and Their Methods.
As we mentioned in the first chapter, there is a disease where one can heal by fire and consuming incendiary drugs; its causes, reasons, methods of application, symptoms, and I have made these into separate sections from century to foot.
And I will elaborate on this in this section with a diagram to facilitate for the student what is required.
Before starting on this, it should be known by you that what is in this section is above the things mentioned in the first chapter.
Therefore, the warning should be quite strong because work in this section involves much bleeding where the life takes when opening a vein or cleft on tumor or fistula discharge or surgical treatment or spleen removal or bone cracking and such methods that bring all these dangers and fears and lead to their death.
I advise you on matters that are somewhat similar to you, for it may occur in this profession among certain types of people through their professions due to those who have been afflicted by illness and dishonored by death.
Those who are afflicted by illness, have long hair and tend to resort to hasty decisions indicating death, among them some who spend money on you and sing for your health as well as their own disease cured - it is not permissamo to assist from those like him with this characteristic.
Be more cautious than your desire and urgency, and do not proceed with anything before you are certain to be beneficial for you when the inevitable consequence occurs, use all treatments for your illnesses by advancing knowledge and warning them of what may bring about health.
You are thus blessed with praise, honor, mention, and thanksgiving; may God inspire your guidance and do not forbid you from goodness and success as this is by His hand.
This section has been arranged from the first century to this foot step that you desire from it, may God wills so.
Chapter amoebas and verminous worms (Amoebiasis and helminthiasis).
Treatment of water that is collected in the heads of boys.
This condition often presents in boys at birth if the skull was squeezed without mercy, and can also be a hidden cause that is not known.
I have not seen this cause in non-boys, and all those who died quickly from it led me to abandon the work, and I saw a boy whose head filled with water and his skull grew every day. Until the boy cannot sit on his own because of skull expansion and humidity increases to death.
This humidity either gathers between the skin and the skull or beneath the skull on the sagittus, and one would cut into that if the humidaturity is between the skin and the skull with a small tumor, it should be incised once in the middle of the head to create an opening whose length approaches two fingers so that the humidity can escape, which represents the image of the lancet.
The humidity increased and the tumor grew larger, so cut two intersecting slits on this image:.
If the moisture under the bone and its sign are such that you see the scalp veins open from all sides, and water recedes to your hand when pressed against it without being hidden by anything, then you should make three incisions in the middle of the head as shown in this image.
After making the incisions, all moisture is drained out and the cuts are closed with stitches and bandaging, then covered from above with a glass container filled with oil on the fifth day after which the binding is removed and the wound is treated with gauze pads, headbands, and without leaving the scalp uneven. The patient should be fed all kinds of dry food with little moisture.
Another incision should be made where the bone of a tumor and accumulation of water are visible, as it may be located in the back or front or on either side of the head.
Aim your incision where the tumor is visible and water accumulation is present, cut it out as much as possible while preserving nerve endings to prevent postoperative bleeding from causing death in the patient due to that bleeding along with moisture drainage.
Chapter II.
The cutting of the two nerves known as "al-hissin".
When severe drops to the eyes or chest occur, followed by a fever and not cured with medication; in such cases, the treatment involves cutting these two nerves.
It was necessary to have them cut so that the head of the disease could move freely with a scalpel, then gently stretch the site by making an incision; as a result, the patient's neck would stiffen due to bleeding and locate where the pulse beats and lowered positions were behind the ears. Only in some cases did this disappear.
Then they were instructed to use a thread, and the nerves were cut with an unsharpened knife reaching up to the bone while exposing the skull; if one wished, the scalpel was inserted from below through the nerve and extended to above by cutting, making the length of the incision approximately two fingers wide.
If the pulse had ceased and blood flowed out in beats, if not felt by touching them, it was necessary to estimate from the ear up to three fingers and then learn with a thread, stretching to the bone which should be approached as follows:
A blood flow of six pints is sent through the middle, and sometimes it may send more or less than that, depending on the severity of the illness and the fullness of its vessels; then upon examining the wound, if there's something like a cyst only on the bone, it should be cut out.
Not showing a tumor, but the wound is closed with thread and needle and then treated with bandages until it heals.
The Third Section.
Suture the two vessels in the bulging.
If a person suffers from chronic conditions or severe attacks before wet-heat and fever in the muscles of the bulging, or long-term severe headache and such symptoms, and medical treatment does not relieve them, we have tried treating these diseases by ligating the vessels in the bulge as described.
The action involved is for the illness to take hair from the bulging and target the visible vessel in the temple; it becomes apparent to you by its pulsation, and soon disappears in some people.
Or when the cold is severe, it may fade from you if the illness strengthens your neck due to its sweat; thus, hold the position with a ligature or expand the location with hot water until the vessel appears distinctly clear. Then take the instrument which has this form. Then skin is gently drawn until it reaches the vessels, and then a suction cup is placed over it to draw it upwards until it exits from underneath from all sides, so that the fine vessels are rolled out at one end of the vacuum pump. Then a piece is cut off to the extent of its separation, and it is tied up without bleeding because it has not been scraped nor split so that blood does not flow initially, then drainage from six or three tubes is performed.
It was crucial for the vessels to be tied at two places with a suture thread, and that the thread should either be silk or woolen so as not to hasten the spread of infection before joining the wound.
Then the suture is cut between the two ties at that hour or later if desired, and it can be held to the bone with a surgical knife until its ends protrude as this work is performed under his own eye or better as we have said.
If the patient has fever or delirium, it is as though one intends to prevent fluid formation in him and ensure he benefits accordingly; after ligating the vessels, a place should be reserved for applying an oily plaster with medicated powders, and after bandaging, treatment with solid medicine that strengthens flesh until he recovers if God wills.
During your work, a bleeding occurs from the vein; then immediately cut it either with your own hand or fill the space with gauze and press until the blood stops. From that point on, do not let anything touch it until it hardens.
Remove the clot by immersing it in boiling water until it is cooled and press on as required, which is less severe and easier than tying the vein to have the blood drain through this technique after learning with needles.
The clot is gradually removed until it reaches the bone and the blood drains through two separate locations that are far apart from each nearby, so it does not adhere to this type of treatment, which is a representation of the technique.
The two needles are similar to small tweezers, except they have less pressure than a large knife since if they were both sharp and heated quickly, the meat would not contract rapidly; however, if there was some resistance in them, it would grasp fire freely.
The meat was cut quickly, which is better and easier than any other work and less severe; after the two needles, let there be a thickness of the finger.
Chapter erseven: Diseases of the Head and Their Treatment
Treatment for Chronic Conjunctivitis to Both Eyes.
If the conjunctiva is chronic and originates from the root at the back of the head, outside and has not responded to any medical treatment with medications, and if you observe that the affected area has turned red: And there is a swelling in his cheek resembling an ant mound, and his wet eyes have been eaten away and adhered together from the outbreak of pus, so the affected edges were compelled to treat it with this operation called "the scissors," which means trimming the hair on its tip.
Then three parallel incisions are made along the length of the cheek, with each incision being equal to one finger's width; the first is at the center of the cheek and the second slightly behind the movement of the muscle that is on the temple, and the third from another side.
And preserve the two incisions on each side and keep them away from joining the flap with your hand; let each incision be as far as three fingers' breadth, and have a prepared needle or a large cloth swatch available to dab off any bleeding.
Then the sharp scissors enter the two sides that this presents. From the slit that leads from the temple to the central groove and pulls all the skin between the two with the fold over the bone, then do this also from the central groove to the third slit, and then exit this instrument. And another instrument enters as well, called a sharp scalpel from one side and an unsheathed knife from the other, they are represented as follows:.
It forms its sharp side towards the muscle attached to the skin and its unsheathed side towards the bamo, pushing it until it ends in the central groove, cutting with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the two eyes without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then it does the same from the central groove to another slit, and after collecting a moderate amount of blood clots at the positions cut by the incision, thread appears in each slit made of silk with an applied bandage and wax or oil paste.
If there is no infection and fever on the third day, the sutures dissolve, and a large amount of bandages soaked with plenty of water are used, then it is treated with hemostatic plasters greased with rose oil and other things that are handled by surgeons until healed.
Chapter Five.
Treatment of pimples and droppings into the eyes from within the skull.
A very severe and chronic drip occurred to someone, where you saw small tears in their eyes, they weakened their sight, and their cheeks were flushed with sweat dripping from them. The pain in the depths of the head is severe and distressing, with continuous dribbling as a symptom indicating that these materials and drips are originating from an extensive deep abdomen. The best treatment for this condition involves instructing the disease to heal by puncturing its base then making one hole in the center of it.
The pain in the depths of the head is severe and distressing, with continuous dribbling as a symptom indicating that these materials and drips are originating from an extensive deep abdomen. The best treatment for this condition involves instructing the disease to heal by puncturing its base then making one hole in the center of it. Or slightly elevate the image and begin puncturing from the left temple to the right temple, with the hole reaching towards the bone further away from your moving cheek muscles when you are biting until the beak unfolds and dries all blood by pressing.
Choose between a leather or silk thread then pull from above the lip and drink the salve with wine and oil so that a hot swelling does not occur, and when it subsides you can see that the hot tumor has disappeared, suggesting the bone should be punctured until flesh begins to sprout.
Then, treat it with the dried dressing that causes the flesh to take as much as two hundred grains of wheat and four parts of quinces, and make a poultice from them and use it on wounds in the meat similarly to these surgerebies.
Chapter  The Sixth.
Treatment for what has fallen in the ear.
All that falls in the ear is of four kinds, either stones or mineral-like iron and glass, or seeds of plants such as mustard and nuts and the like, or fluids similar to water and vinegar.
Or if it is an insect, when it falls in the ear do not leave it there; use sunlight through the ear to see only the grains and then squeeze them out with something like beeswax or cerumen by moving your head or turning the cone. Close the ear canal when full of liquid after wrapping around the ear with gauze or cotton and stretching the ear a lot to expel it through this treatment; if not expelled, then try removing it gently by squeezing as shown here.
Indeed, it came out in a clot and then tried to remove it with a gentle spoon extractor, but did not succeed; so made a tube from copper and inserted the end of the tube into the ear hole, yes indeed.
And closed around the tube with a little oily wax so that there would be no leakage through the non-tube path, then drew it out strongly and frequently until something came out as we described; but did not come out in this manner, so took from alka or refined clay which takes birds' nests, placed at the ear opening.
After being injured by a pierced quill, inserted into the ear hole gently after drying the ear from moisture, did not come out as we described before it started to swell or become inflamed.
The incision heals the ailment in the ear canal first and ejects as much blood as possible, then sits with the affliction between your hands while tilting its ear upward and scratching a small incision at the beginning of the ear canal near the lower part of the skin.
The incision resembles a crescent until it reaches the bone, then you remove it with what tools are available and quickly suture the incision on both sides while treating it.
If the object that fell into the ear is from a seed that has germinaturun and swells, then as we mentioned try to extract it without using force; instead, take a delicate sharp instrument.
Try to extract that type of seed fallen in the ear with it, but only do so if you are certain that the seed has become softened by the heat of the ear and turned into many small pieces; then remove them using an eyedropper or a gentle spray bottle or dropper.
As we mentioned, it facilitates its removal; for the water inside the ear, one should first use a catheter with a kundus tip and then fill the ear with something from cotton wool that is comfortable on the ear where the water has accumulated to allow it to exit.
And so, he took many tiny feathers along the length of his fingers to wrap them lightly with fire and then inserted one into a hole in his ear and carried it on one hand from that side; he also hit another rock against the rock inside the ear. (Note: This seems like an erroneous or misinterpreted translation, as Albucasis's techniques are well-documented and do not include such methods.)
The section continues with the count until all water has drained out, and the water may drain as it takes from the cold or a single feather entering one ear and exiting through the other hole scorched further and then replaced by another feather.
It does that multiple times until all water is drained or sucked through the tube provided in the scale, and as for the animal inside it being small like a beetle they treat it as described in the division and so on.
If it was a large body appearing to the touch, try extracting it with pincers and tweezebe easier than all that comes out of the ear, and as for the extraction of snakes hatched in the ear if treated as we mentioned in the division in the article on ear drops and did not cure your treatment.
It was necessary to look at the ear in sunlight as if an aspect of a snake appeared, extract it with forceps or fine tweezers and if nothing appeared from there do not use this tube.
Narrow at the bottom and wide at the top and insert the fine end into the ear as much as the illness allows then press it firmly do this multiple times until all snakes come out but you should not remove around the tube with wax as mentioned to you in the scale.
Indeed, if not what we mentioned, use the droplets that were mentioned and tried them by the early ones in killing the worms and it is found therein in the chapter on droplets, and your caskets and drugs should be in the ear with this device.
As you see, it is made of silver or copper with a narrow bottom and a wide top hole, and the tube inside can be made of solid brass, and if desired, cotton wool should be wrapped at its end in silk.
Then take the ointment or decoction you want from this drug in the tube and place it in the ear, then insert the cotton with your fingers until a moderate pressure is felt inside the ear canal.
If the illness is inside, and what you apply to the ear has been warmed slightly, be careful that it does not drip too cold or too hot as the ear cannot bear such extremes.
Chapter Seven.
Treatment of a Pretracheal Tube for the Ear. (Note: The translation provides only the title as per the instruction; no additional information or context is included.)
Some children may exit from their mothers' wombs with uncarved ears.
Also, some people may present a plug in the ear canal due to an injury or tumor within it and this blockage can be deep within the hole of the ear that cannot be seen by sight.
It may be presented to the outside of a hole slightly and can be seen by sight, which is in deeper parts of the ear that cannot be seen by sight; it is often an accumulation of pus and should have the affected ear exposed to sunlight. The view is that it appears to be an open plug with a gentle push, this being its image:. (Note: Without the accompanying image or additional context on what "this" refers to, translation cannot be completed.)
A part of it extends a little outside and the rest is pressed on either side so as not to harm the ear, and if the blockage was due to tumor tissue within the ear canal, gently scrape with tweezeback and cut it off very carefully until all the tissue is removed.
The blockage was deep within the ear canal with a slight bulging on either side, and then it moved along the inner ear to where one might feel the weight of hearing loss by pulling gently. (Note: Without an accompanying image or additional context for "the illness feels" part, translation cannot be completed.)
"Save from injuring the auditory nerve, then make a tube in the ear according to the depth of the hole; it should be inserted into an Egyptian pillowcase for several days until the wound is healed or take the tube and place it in water and sprinkle powder on it.
"After using it, you will see that the ear has become inflamed and painful; it is best to remove the tangle and replace it with another one that had soaked in quinces made from rose oil until the hot swelling settles down and then treat it to heal.
"If there is bleeding from a wound or tear in the ear, place it in cold water and put it on the ear; then apply the treatment described in the section on bleeders to stop the bleeding mentioned.
"Chapter Eight.
"Treatment of the fever that occurs in thunderstorms.
"This fever that occurs in thunderstorms may be moist or dry; it should be held with a spoon or ladle and cut off using the handle of a utensil, then take it to the designated place and sprinkle powder on it.
"Indeed, if it bleeds, use a fine glass syringe and inject as much as necessary after cutting. Often things return to their original state; however, if set on fire, those parts are burned.
Chapter Nine.
Treatment for fake cold in eye storms.
Often, in storms, something presents resembling a severe cold with stiffness.
Therefore, the cold is termed an assembly of dense moisture in both upper and lower eyes, with its work being that it appears prominent in eye appearance to move to each side easily separated by a slit.
Then, peel it off gently from all sides until it separates completely and label it as a warning then cut it, because you won't be able to do anything after the eye completes cutting so that the disease doesn't harm something else, if the slit was large gather it with stitching and treat it until healed.
And if it is small do not worry about it the dressing will force and cushion it, as the cold would be inclined inside the eye towards the inner surface of the eyeball and label it with a warning so that you don't need to cut and remove it from all sides.
Indeed, the incision was made with a cut without causing any harm, then the eye was wasculed after cutting out the pus with salt water and treated at the site by applying pressure until the patient recovered.
Chapter Ten.
Treatment of the squint presenting in an eye's eyelid.
Squint is a thickening in the upper layers of the eyelid that presents itself commonly in children, causing their eyes to droop and exposing them to watering in the tear ducts, with an inability to look at sunlight. In order for tears to flow faster.
Therefore, they constantly sit on their faces and sleep with them open so that their eyelids become moist from the air they breathe in, thus making the squint noticeable to the observer and when you press your fingers on the site of the swelling, feeling a squint between them. The treatment involves placing the head on a stone.
Then you take a piece of cotton thread from it, make a tube out of that thread and form a ring large enough to encircle the squint from all sides then place it on it and press around with your fingers so as to gather the squint in the middle of the circle.
Then, he makes a cut in the middle of that moisture with a sharp knife, making a slit lengthwise and not larger than the slit at the back, and as for deeper it should be scratched all over the skin until reaching the subcutaneous tissue.
In most cases, the bleeding from the incision appears as a white fatty piece attracted by a scraping that has been wrapped between your fingers and taken outwards; you manage it with both hands until you are spared, but beware not to enlarge the incision so that the knife does not pierce inside.
If the bleeding does not appear at first in the incision, it is appropriate to slightly enlarge the incision until the bleeding appears; then attract it as we mentioned before and immerse a scraping of salt and water on the spot and press it with a dressing, some people scrape the area.
He places it in the depth of the incision for any remaining moisture to dissolve, then treats until healed; if an issue occurs at the spot, effectively treat it with soothing compresses until cured,.
The Tenth Chapter.
In the examination of the eye.
If in the eye socket a growth exceeds beyond its natural path beneath the usual folds and becomes inflamed, it harms the eye causing conditions such as constant tearing, laxity of the eyelids, pallor, and thickness until this leads to loss of vision.
Examining the eye involves four approaches: either by touch using hot oil or with a strong drug applied to the outer edge, and whether the surgery is done through cutting and stitching or using a probe based on what I have mentioned earlier.
The head of the patient should be tilted with your left hand so that it turns, otherwise insert a needle into its eyeball from below and pass the thread through it from above; this will bring the hair close to itself and pull the thread upwards towards the upper part of the eye.
Next, rotate it again and gently incise the inside of the eyeball using a well-secured scalpel from the larger to the smaller lacrimal duct then thread the needle through this gap and place under the eye with a small piece of silk or gauze; finally, sew up the eye with a stitch.
Like a sheet of glass, so it is appropriate that the shape should be raised as much as you desire to lift the eyelid, since in this regard people differ and some need to cut from the eyelid to an extent that is healed sufficiently based on how much the eyebrow has relaxed.
Then those who need to cut less, do so based on how much the eyelid has relaxed. Begin cutting with a scalpel on the two lines you have marked and start from the larger upper margin to the smaller lower one; each incision should be close to the natural hairline like an adhesive bandage.
Then insert a cauterizing stick into one of the corners of the skin, then pull it out entirely; gather both eyelids with needlework using tweezebrushes and fine silk thread to clean blood and sew what remains in place securely.
If you wish to do so, leave the suturing and threads for about three or four days then treat it; if not sewn up, handle by drying out and compressing as when unsewing the wound, upon completion of healing, closing and joining, stitching is better.
This method of suture was mentioned by the ancients, but in it there is an application on the wound and it is good work with no risk involved, another method of suture also, learning how to sew the eyelids like a sheet of paper as we have described. Then the eyelid is raised by three pins which serve as a fork or cluster in this picture:.
Then cut what remains of the eyelid with a small knife as shown in this picture:.
It is not possible to fasten the pins and you will not be able to pull a needle through it, insert another thread in the center of the figure and then another thread near the larger arc and a third thread near the smaller arc, gather your threads evenly with smoothness and raise them slowly by hand.
Raise the skin instructed on it all as we have described, then gather the edges of the wound with a thread and treat it until it heals; if you cut or open the abscess, cover that tumor with plaster and dress it similarly to the compressive garments.
The lower eyelid may also indicate that its edges should be handled in the manner we have mentioned with cutting, sewing, and dressing with fire or acrid medication, make sure to inform and advise on matters of cutting, sewing, and treatment with fire or potent medicine.
Measuring with a tube that is suitable for this purpose and turning the eyelid while probing the incision as previously described, then creating two tubes or thin strips of wood equal in length to the eyelid and narrower than its width.
They have borrowed from each side where the threads cling and then gently gather them on what it prefers of the eyelid, tightening the tubes from both sides firmly and leaving them for days; the tanned skin suffocates and fades away and rots.
Until they fall from themselves, causing a delay in borrowing by the loaner, then treating until healed; if it swells and does not drop on the eyelashes, this is an image of tubes made on this shape and size - lengthwise and widthwise.
Section Twelve.
In lifting the eyelashes of the eye with a needle.
If the eyelashes or two are obstructive, a delicate needle is inserted into them, with a thin thread of fine silk wound around it and then tied off at both ends forming a fine knot, making the length of the thread close to an inch.
Then, fasten with a fine thread on the apparatus without it in the palace and knot its ends as you wish; then place the patient's head near the stone so that the sun may dry up the work quickly, for this is delicate work; then enter the needle through the ligature at the source of the swelling.
She executes it quickly in the nostril, pulling it out above the natural hairline, then draws the thread up over the apparatus and enters into the ligature of that follicle or one to three.
Then you pull it out with the ligature in the nostril along with the natural hair, if pulled upwards, the apparatus was drawn and did not come out with the follicle; pull downwards with the thread used to tie them until the ligatures are removed from above the hole.
Then return the follicle and pull them until it rises above the hole, being seen by the eye; then untie the ligatures and thread, remove them, secure the eye and leave it taut for two or three days until the flesh settles in place and grows over it.
Indeed, the hair was short; either it had been supplemented with a long natural hair which grew along with it, or it had been left until it naturally lengthened after a certain period of time, then it would be lifted.
The Third Book.
In treating the camel with an issue occurrabn in its upper eyelid, ... (The rest of Albucasis's text would follow)
The camel presenting with this condition, known as 'rabbitness', was either natural or bred for a specific purpose such as wounds from injuries, cuts, etc. ... (The rest of Albucasis's text would follow)
The treatment involved removing the swelling and separating its eyelids, placing a string of wool between them until it healed, without resorting to drying agents or constrictive materials in treating it. ... (The rest of Albucasis's text would follow)
If you performed this, the camel returned worse than before because of using substances like soot and tannin solution in water mixed with my nasal conchae's extract diluted with some liquid that dissolved the flax string which stained it and was treated with it ... (The rest of Albucasis's text would follow)
"The treatment of the jinn is to soften it with every possible means so that it does not assault the body, and this work which we mentioned only refers to part of equine surgery, so that the tissue does not return according to what was determined by the diagnosis.
Chapter Fourteen.
In treating a horse whose problem lies in the lower eyelid.
This horse that is considered mature is indeed a horse and naturally leans towards showmanship, being of a type characterized by wounds or cracks or similar issues.
The method of work is to take a suture thread and insert it into the meat, pushing it from left ligament to right ligamen until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh; then extend the meat above with the needle and cut it using the scissors.
The eyelid should return to its normal shape, but if it does not, one must take a thread and place it at the crack's location, turning the lid over it and making two incisions on the inner side of the lid such that the tips of these cuts form an angle from which they came. Until they come together in the form mentioned above:
It is the Greek letter, then remove that meat as far down to below the eyelet as possible; and gather together dispersed parts with two threads twisted on a woolen thread, and treat it as we mentioned from antiseptic drugs and plaster until healed.
And if the camel showed a crack, cut or incision in it, then one should make a simple cut without damaging hairs as well as on what is offered and then separate between the lips with plaster as we mentioned.
The sentence on treating the camel says to perform surgery either above or below according to what you find of the camel's constitution, for they may vary greatly in shape; the surgeon adapts his approach as much as possible.
Until it resembles its natural form or approaches it, the same disease guides it to what is suitable for work and instrument in most cases,.
The fifteenth chapter.
For adhering the eyelid to the lash or bone.
This joining may cause many people to have the eyeball bleed by its own blood and prevent it from moving freely, hindering its natural actions; therefore, a rod should be inserted under the eye.
This is raised to the surface or stretched with a needle, then breaking away from the clotting using a soft cutter that does not severally cut the clots but rather gently so as not to worry the patient when working in the eye socket, the puncturing of which can aggravate the affliction. Then you will pull out that adhesion.
It is expected that when the eye returns to its natural form and all adhesions are removed, then in the eye put salt water to wash it or soak with a sharpened syringe of saline solution, then separate between the eyelid and the eye using cotton threads.
And place above the eye a swab soaked with egg whites, and after three days use compresses until it heals,.
Chapter sixteen.
On the nail of the finger and sole of the foot. (Note: The translation here does not require any additional explanation as per the instruction.)
The nail is either neural and hard like fine ivory or non-neural resembling a solid white mass if cut with iron or pierced with the needle, it has been severed. (Note: As per instruction, this translation doesays nothing more than what's written in the text)
In this version, the bandage was not confirmed; both types merely serve to extend from the largest pouch so that it drips a little bit by droplets until it covers the wound and prevents light and eye movement, and the face of the work in its cut has placed the disease head on your stone.
Then he opens his eyes and raises the eyelid in your hand, then takes a small piece of string with tweezebrushes and stretches it upwards, then takes a needle and inserts hair from horse or cow fur into it, twists one end slightly, and inserts it into the center of the flap.
She performs it with the needle and ties it to the string on the flap, stretches it upwards, and draws out hair from one side of the flap where the eye socket is as if spreading hair onto another, then cuts off the remainder at the base of the pouch using a fine scalpel or small scissors and discards the natural fat of the pouch.
However, it shows from the cut a permanent tear duct; the flap has been stretched with either string or thread as we mentioned before and drawn to one edge, where this image is:. (Note: The given text seems to be incomplete, ending abruptly without showing an actual image reference.)
"It is imperative to avoid the instrument touching the horny covering if a fracture occurs in it, then after cutting, something from powdered salt or ground cinnabar should be applied and left until another day before treating as necessary for healing.
"The nail was not nervous and did not allow a needle to enter it or confirm its presence easily, so this type of nail is healed with medication as described in the section on amputation.
"Take a gentle smooth hook at this side of the image: "If the nail has a rough crust on it, I noticed that it becomes loose and frays, so only applying from your bottle of ground cinnabar or red powdered pills or powdered salt once in an eye until another day.
"Then do the work again until all of them except for one in your eye, cover it with an ointment you apply to a sore and treat the hot boil until healed; then continue treating it with crusting until cured.
Indeed, if the juice causes a heinous irritation to the eye, hang that juice with the vinegar and cut off part of it so as not to squeeze in the cutting lest blood droplets occur; then strain into a red-hot glass or pottery vessel until relief.
Chapter Seventeen.
In the juice and what grows from excess flesh in the eye.
Some people may develop red, swolpressions in their eyes that cover the sclera or approach it, and spill over onto the eyelids; sometimes these spillovers turn back outward resembling a rose petal.
The treatment involves placing the patient's head in a vessel and opening their eyes to catch all of that red flesh using approved strainers.
Or grasp it with a pincers or tweezers, then cut off the first piece until all is separated and keep clear of the eyes so as not to irritate them during work; these fragments should be placed in the container described for nail clippings or with a small scissors. As the substance collected in what emerges through this gate is gathered here.
If you have been operated on and both eyes are affected, fill the eye with finely sifteblue dye or drop red tincture into it as prescribed by medicinal drugs; wear eyepads made from white cotton to protect the tumor inside.
If one eye has become inflamed, and blood is oozeback due to a hot tumor; apply a remedy that cools the tumor and cover it; do this regularly until recovery and also treat with fatty meat showing in such eyes of this kind.
It is advisebehind that you avoid treating a weak eye through surgery or working with iron unless it becomes clear to you that this operation is likely successful for such cases.
The eighth chapter of the book.
In case a lump appears in the eye.
If a red swelling spreads on the eye, preventing vision and weakening it over days; firstly, ensure that the eye with the lump is strong and not affected by any other diseases.
Then take a lump and order it to stand on your stone; hang the swelling with one or two lanterns according to skill, ensuring they are gently hanging on this image:.
He is a double-bladed poniard in one body depicted on this image:
Then, using a gentle scalpel, take the vein with care and wipe away the blood as soon as you see it turn golden from there, and stop bleeding; also protect the eye by not injuring it with the edges of the scissors, so that your work is half done towards the sun.
And in your work, you have done very well so as not to cut any other vein when the gap is only incised; also, slice the green or red sclerotica of the eyeball until there is nothing left but a small piece; thus, you could not catch it all at once during that hour, and straitening the eye may alleamoad the pain in the eye.
Leave it for days until the pain subsides and the swelling cools, then do your work on this condition with her eye until she recovers from the image of the suturing scissors.
And let his head be in the child's pillow so that it drains and stops bleeding, and achieves a channel at the forehead of the eye; then he should open the eye with fixed or triangular flaps to catch it.
"The incision is made at the base of the eyebrow and another one that drains pus, ensuring a drain in front of the eye and its socket; you may decide to take a picture from above or below the eye, with two ligatures on the upper part - one on each side.
"Hold it between the middle and outer third, then hang ligatures below them, then securely fasten between the lateral and medial parts of the incision; you should gently remove the sutures until all layers have risen above a small incision from the lesser angle to the eyebrow, which you cut with scissors or blunt instrument.
"The needle pierces the eyelid, and all layers are tightened until they rise above the bone without cutting a drain or bleeding.
"Then cut with scissors anything above and below the eyelid until no lid tissue remains; you can lift it from above the bone, suture tightly as this is best practice although some people may find a similar method.
"If you cut it leaving the lesion intact for days, allowing pain and treating heat-induced tumors, then resume work on it.
Chapter 19.
In Regurgitation of the Feather to the Nose.
Surgeons call it Nasus Aviarius if treated with the root or a severe purifying herb as described, and she has not recovered except by scratching on the tumor at its maturer stage and extracting all moisture within or pus.
Until the bone is exposed if you find decay or blackness within, use this instrument to scrape it off:
A hard instrument made of Indian iron, with a head shaped like a bowl that has intricate carvings or engravings similar to the scapularis fish's scales placed on the site of bone decay and held between your fingers while you slightly press down until you realize that the rot has been extracted.
You do this repeatedly until you compress the location with a drying sticky medication, then close off the site and flesh grows in it; the thread is cut after forty days, has not spread further, nor flaked away, nor burst, nor occurred therein.
Know that it has recovered, except for Nasus Aviarius to the hole in the nose on this type and she reveals the bone a second time with iron or a severe medication if the bangle is exposed on these images:
The iron piece should be triangular and its legs cylindrical, brought to the edge as you see it then placed on the bone itself near the joint slightly away from your eye with your hand, then press with a spoon until the bone is displaced by the illness.
If the fume is found to have exited when his hand was held on its nose, then I forced the place with a tightened dried drug as I told you; if the flesh grew and solidified in place, the material that was holding out will return to the nose and be less severe than the illness by God's will.
The Hundredth Chapter.
Reduce inflamm#ation of the eye.
If the eye swells and there is no disturbance in vision or deficiency, then it should be facilitated to heal and then open it with an ointment on a tampon atop the eyelid without any condition, dip it gently.
Then place on the eye a poultice made of alum, rose water and lard with ostrich fat; hold the eyelid over it generously with an adhesive bandage using softly burned wax that has been melted to seal all tears from fourfold layers.
Then place them one on top of the other as much as she needs to press her eye, then tightly clench with a stiff piece and return it to the cup without exception, then extract the pus and leave the eyelid squeezed for a day and night.
It is best to relax the bandage for a while, then remove it after a day and night as we said; you will see that the eye has returned, but otherwise reapply the dressing, compressor, tighten, and extract pus until it returns.
The Tenth Surgical Chapter.
On the grapevine section.
If a fracture is presented in the grapevine section and then swells and protrudes out of the canopy as an anthropomorphic depiction of the grape, I would cut it accordingly to work on what was described.
It involves inserting a needle from the base of the grape upwards, then inserting another needle into it to thread through the stem and pull through the first needeen, as per its condition.
Then cut the location of the threaded stem and tie some grapes around the needle, squeeze tightly for a while, then remove the needle and place it on the eye covered in fluffy white albumen until the threads with the grape fall off, then treat the eye as instructed to strengthen it.
Until the wound heals, take an almond from every direction with a circular cut until it exudes enough to stick with a delicate instrument into the inner corner of the eye; then let it fall so that the white moisture can drain out and cling to the base; hold it tightly until it is healed.
Section II, Chapter XX.
In treating a concealed injury.
This type of concealed injury is but a small gathering in the eye resembling water, not actual water, and the treatment thereof involves having the patient lie on an upright chair so that you can take their head from both sides.
Move it until the mass descends to your foot, then hold firmly and do not waver; light emits from it, seeing the injury as if unchanged, even though the mass has not fully fallen down, indicating that it is indeed water as we mentioned.
Or have the patient sit with their head between your hands, then take a delicate instrument and pierce slightly over the conjunctiva where it is attached to the cornea until the matter drains out.
If a drop was made in the eye, mixed with hot water and honey or heated milk with honey, then the entire treatment is applied until it clears up.
The Third and Twenti cued section.
We mentioned that types of water are divided and which one is suitable for the cup by a clarified and explained statement; therefore, it should be taken from there for your health, then the patient must sit with hands placed crosswise near sunlight.
Then attach the correct eye and press firmly, then lift the eyelid with your left hand if the eye that contains water is the left eye or with your right hand if it's the right eye.
Then place the cup's edge close to your nail, pressing firmly in sync with the eye'ebulgence from the inner corner and then push the cup forcefully while holding it with your hand until fully penetrated into the eyeball and feel that something empty has been reached.
The cup should descend to the depth equal to the distance from one iris to another, which is the eyebrow of the eye and it appears clear as a mirror to the other eye then the cup descends to above where the water is located.
Then he inserts it downward once more, after which the water drains from his tear ducts and he sees what opens in front of him through his eye; then he rests a bit as the water rises again before exiting without being discharged from the tool.
If it becomes stable and does not ascend, the tool is gently extracted in your hand little by little until it dissolves in a bowl of clear distilled water; then wash out the eye from inside with it before placing it outside completely or wrapping it in moistened gauze.
Apply rosewater and egg whites, attach them to the correct eye, as in our time we apply al-kumoon pulverized with egg white; so you don't need the tool entering into the eye for its stability because some people have very firm eyes. It is advised to use the instrument called "al-briid":
Insert the same piece of wood as before but do not push into the socket; rather, gently tap a suitable location for the tool and then insert the tool as we have mentioned, after compleaturition, prepare a comfortable bed where the patient can rest on their back in a dark room.
He abstains from all movements and vomiting, making his food follow its natural course without moving his head to the right or left or twisting the binder until the third day has passed, then remove it in a dark room and observe with your eyes.
He leaves things as they are, then removes the binder on the seventh day and should not do so during or after your hourly sips of water, but rather avoid it until the water rises quickly with a strong gaze.
The presentation of a heated tumor should be removed from the eye before the seventh day and treated until it cools, allowing the tumor to remain until it has cooled; then release your gaze and place a compress on your face for two days in a dark room beforehand.
He leaves the house gradually and behaves according to his reasons, knowing that a learner does not need continuous observation; at times he should present for work, some Iraqis have noted that he mentioned making special diuretic cups from Iraq.
I have not seen this being made in our country, nor has it been read in an old book, and it could be a recent addition; these are images of types of cups with handles on which to rest one's hand for convenience:.
The excerpt translates to: "Made of brass with a sharp pointed end.
Section IV and XXII.
Treatment for a dislocated nose.
It may sprout different kinds of nasal polyps, resembling a scorpion's tail with many legs; some are solid and potentially cancerous like colored dye, while others are flaccid without coloring.
A tender and non-malignant meat should sit between your palms, facing the sun at noon with its nostril open to inhale spices placed on those meats; then gently pull it out through the opening you've made from one side.
Only once you realize the entire meat has been removed can it be considered gone; if you cannot cut it out with a delicate tool gently, nothing remains of it except your blood or an ulcerous lesion.
If it is apt or if the cancer has advanced, press a fig until blood flows and all meats descend; then after cutting, no matter what remains in the nose will be removed with water or wine which opens up the nostrils allowing moisture to drain into the throat.
Know that it has healed, but the moisture was not done properly as should be; know that meat fat is in the upper part of the bones with a lot of tendons and the instrument did not reach this piece then it is necessary to take a thread from cat's intestine.
It is complicated by many joints and the threads are as short as a finger or less, and the illness shifts to one side of the string in its nostril with movement or as much as possible after making it like a snare and attracting its breath until it reaches the pouch.
It exits through its ring and does so much like this act in the book that it is easy for anyone who wants to, then both sides of the string gather where one came out on the mouth and the other remained in the nostril.
Then the muscle stretched with the joints in the string is done until it is known that the meat has been cut by the thread's joint and the thread comes out through the nostril after wiping the blood with a tube that had been drunk in Egyptian pouches, doing so for three days or more.
Until the plaster has consumed all of the meat, then another thing will come out from the nose through a glass tube for days until healed; if necessary, treatment that dries up what is used.
Image of the device that drains from the nostraturi and medication in the nose:.
A silver or copper semicircular cup, open on the side and held alike:.
And if you make the tube closed like a pipe and drain the instrument flat:.
It has a handle at the other end, as you see it gripped by him if heated in it with wax or anything else poured:.
The fifth and twentieth chapter:.
In the slender tube's handle at the nose end:.
Often it grows at the nose end, a bubble in the skull and increases over days until it is infected:.
Therefore, it is required to cut it as soon as it appears and extract everything, then apply on the spot either a scab or a burning medicine that the incision deals with; if missed, cutting it passes until bone healing has been seen as a hardened color dye:.
Do not expose it to iron, for it is a cancerous tumor and I have often seen from this tumor large bile discharges in the person who has it; even if the tumor is soft and not colored by blood, all of it can be cut out. Empty the disease and cut it without hesitation, and do not delay in treating its position that is drying up and constricting until he recovers.
Chapter Six and Twenty.
In the threading of the nose, mouth, and ears. If the connection of its threads is divided by a wound or near it, know that at some time a disconnection occurred in one of these nerves and do not expect any benefit except in some people.
When one of these people is presented with a condition, consider if the wound has collected blood in it that should gather its threads by suturing and then treat it until he recovers; even if the disconnection had caused shedding of their threads, all of it has become correct to extract each gap with fat from his outer skin until they coalesce.
Then gather the threads of their mouth by suturing and securing them, pour honeyed grated onions and cheese over it from above to apply a drop of henna ointment or any other plasters, leave it tightened for two or three days then dissolve it.
The medicine is replaced and left until the threads are cut from it, then treated with a compress until recovery; the procedure of suturing is to gather separated connections either by needle as described in abdominal suturing or by thread as you have learned here.
Chapter Seven and Twenty.
In the output of the agreement presented on the sheets.
A large number of people may exhibit small, firm tumors resembling walnuts in their mouths; it is appropriate to roll the tongue and scrape each node and suspend them with a lancet.
It is then separated from all sides, and the area after cutting is filled with powdered lime until bleeding stops, followed by oozing out of vinegardressings at the sites, including salt to hasten healing.
Chapter Eight and Twenty.
In the incision of oversized meat in the gums.
It is often found on the gums oversized meat called "Aboulus," it should be clamped with a lancet or tied off by an embalmer, cut at its origin and left to cease bleeding then place powdered plaster on the site.
He returns the treated meat frequently, so cut it again quickly and treat it gently, for it does not return after this treatment.
Chapter Nine and Twenty.
In the field of iron teeth.
They may aggregate in the enamel of teeth from inside and outside, between rough granules that are discolored, becoming black, green, and yellow until it leads to gum disease and causes the gums around the teeth to become inflamed.
It should be that the patient sits between your hands and his head on your lap, brushes the teeth and tooth enamel exposed in them, removing any granules or sand-like substance until nothing remains. Likewise with stains, bleeding, discoloration (green), and other types of matter until it is cleansed thoroughly.
Gold, wherein lies only the initial layers should be refiled in another day or two and a third time until you reach what is desired. Know that teeth need different shapes of files frequently according to the shape of your work.
For the smooth file that files the tooth from inside, not the non-smooth file that files it from outside and another type of file used between teeth on a different shape, which are all types of files you should have prepared:.
Chapter 30: Remedies for Diseases in Children and Adults with Surgical Cures
Extracting Teeth
Treat the toothache with every possible method, and if it must be extracted, do not pull out a noble tooth unless absolutely necessary.
If the patient insists on extracting it, make sure to securely hold it until the affected tooth is numb under your care. Often the toothache deceives and he believes the right tooth is extracted, but the pain persists until the patient removes his own tooth; we have seen this from barbers' practices.
If the affected toebone is visible, then it should be looped around with a pin and some force until part of the decay has been loosened from each side; first slightly move it using your fingers or very fine pliers slowly and carefully.
Then, if both large forceps are adequately tightened and the tooth between your jaw muscles is not moved, gently pull it out evenly without breaking until you can extract it smoothly; otherwise use those instruments carefully as previously instructed.
If the jaw is artificial or has been eaten away, it should be filled with a graft and sewn up properly using fine sutures so that there are no leaks when pulled on with ligatures. It should also be inspected around the edges of the ulcer from all sides.
Preserve your effort so that it does not break again, and leave some at the top of the wound with a layer thicker than the original skin, and make what a cobbler makes on their bridle straps and fasten them to the jaw without using anything we have described.
Frequently, on people of great stature, the jaw is broken and all its parts are left or some of them. Or if they extract some of the jawbone as we saw in an example, and then it swells after extraction with wine or vinegar-salt water, a lot of bleeding occurs from that spot which cracks open something similar to a blister when this happens.
But if the blister did not help you, a picture of fine sutures that move with the jaw initially being long-tongued, short-handled, thick so that it does not bend when pulled on with them onto the jaw is a picture of large ligatures:.
As you see, make it thickly gripped so that when grasped, it does not slip or bend quickly at the ends, and let it be made of Indian iron or well-tempered steel with brazed ends where one enters into another making a tight grip.
The handles have also been crafted to be strong and sturdy.
Chapter on Surgery and Thirty.
In a ring, the ends of pliers and protruding broken bones.
If at the end of a pliers' grip, its jaw has fractured, it should be placed on a bed of camel fat for one or two days until the joint relaxes and then insert a small piece or tendons into it. Similar to a bird's beak, called "bullarge," and this is the image of tendons:.
If the pliers have been made of ivory or like eschelag, do not remove them with these tendons but should be drilled out at the root and the flesh fully exposed using a chisel then insert the device resembling a small pillar as depicted here:.
A short stump, somewhat thick and not waterloguted breaks off so that the root comes out with it; otherwise use other instruments as shown in the image herein, for example a triangular end on one of them.
Another figure which is also triangular.
And we also used this instrument with two prongs as shown herein too.
Except for the tools and blades mentioned in chapter on amputations, we also used this instrument which resembles a large lancet as shown herein.
A triangular end somewhat thick and curved, not waterlogged, may break off; be aware that instruments for amputations are numerous as well as those listed herein, but a skilled craftsman with his expertise might devise tools according to the work at hand and their diseases.
Because diseases may not have been mentioned in the early texts, if a bone of the jaw breaks or one from the teeth falls out, use any of these tools and hooks mentioned herein that suits it for retrieval.
We need to use this sheep've gotten its form:
It has some thickness to adjust the bone so it does not weaken until the bone comes out, and we secured the spot with approved medication for that, hence the bone in it had been faded far from its dye and color until it purified, then treated until healed.
The second and thirtieth chapter.
Regarding the publication of loose fractures on others.
If the fractures occurred elsewhere than naturally, it is considered that the image depicts this and especially if this happened in women and children, then the tooth should be examined as though it has erupted behind another tooth.
He was not able to extract or remove it, and if labeled with another toe, he should cut it off using this device as depicted here:.
It resembles a small beak and is made of sharp Indian iron, cut it for you in many days to ensure the stability of the bone and if not disturbed by other fractures, also provided Nataia was able to extract it using an instrument as depicted here.
He is entirely from India, and the nail of it is extremely delicate like a tool used for creating eyebrows; slightly warming with it weakens the tooth somewhat over several days gently so that the tooth does not loosen, then resets and polishes it again.
And if the tooth has been broken off and it irritates the tongue when speaking, then warm it as well so that it can heal completely until the breakage subsides, is filled in, smoothed out, and does not irritate the tongue or impair speech.
The Third Chapter and Thirty-Three.
In the movement of moving teeth with silver or gold wires.
If the lower teeth are unstable and move due to a hit or fall, and cannot be held in place by anything to eat without falling apart again, treat them with dental splints; if this treatment does not help.
The solution is to hold them with a gold or silver wire, as gold is better because silver tarnishes and decays after several days while gold remains unchanged; the wire should be firm yet flexible enough between teeth.
Image of Ligature: Taking the thread and inserting a loop between the correct teeth, then sewing on both sides of the moving jaws until reaching the ligature to the correct molar from the opposite side.
Then the suturing is returned to the side where it began, and your hand gently holds until there is no movement of the bit, with the thread tension maintained at the point when the jaws are closed so that they do not gap, then cut off the excess end of the thread with a scissor, gather them together, spit them out and hide them between the correct molar and the moving one.
So that the tongue does not hurt, then leave it as tightened until it relaxes or breaks loose, tie off with another thread for your pleasure like this throughout all time - this is an image of correct molars and ligature set-up in two healthy molars and two moving ones as seen:.
A tooth or two may fall out after settling into place as we described and remain, but that is what a gold dentist does in crafting an alloy of molars - he removes bone from the cow's teeth for this setup and places it where the tooth went. He continues as we said he would and enjoys it.
Chapter Four and Thirty-Two.
In the section showing the ligament suppressing speech under the tongue.
This ligament under the tongue may either be naturally produced by humans or may appear as a result of healing from an injury.
The work involves opening the mouth of the patient and inserting a tool into their throat, then severing that nerve with the intention to release the tongue from its grip. This was done skillfully and meticulously as part of healing an injury where there had been a puncture wound and tearing by exposure until the ligament grew back and dissolved the knot.
Be cautious that cutting too deeply into the muscle may cut a vein there causing bleeding, then it will swell as a result of the incision with rose water or vinegar and cold water; therefore place a string under the tongue to be held by the patient every night.
If it happens to bleed a lot, apply powdered alum on the spot and use an eyeglass lens that has been warmed up for that purpose. Then he treats him with all the treatment until he recovers.
Chapter five and thirty.
In the outflow of the frog that is born under the tongue.
It may occur under the tongue with a small frog-like tumor preventing the tongue from performing its natural function, and possibly causing deformity until it fills the mouth; work so that the affected's mouth opens towards the sunlight and looks at the swelling.
I saw it as a color or black stiff mass that the patient does not feel, so if it is not cancerous and there is pus in it, scrape off with a gentle instrument and remove from all sides.
Your excess blood is while you are removing it with a crushed poultice until the bleeding stops, then continue your work until completion and let him soak in salt water.
Then treat with all the appropriate treatment until he recovers,.
Chapter six and thirty.
In treating lupus tumors.
What is growing on the throat from other tumors may show inside the throat glands resembling those that protrude called lupus, if treated as mentioned in section division it did not recover.
"Consider that a hard tumor, like dye with little feeling, should not be exposed to iron if it is red and its origin is thick; for there is no bleeding but leave it until it matures or bursts from itself.
"And if it is white and its origin is thin, this should be cut; assessment before operating in case the tumor has fully settled or some deficiencies.
"Then the patient sat in a sun chair with his head on your table and opened his mouth, taking hold of the dental instrument between your hands to press downward using this device as she depicted it:" (Please note that without an image or additional context, it is not possible to accurebuild a complete translation for "ØµÙØ±ØªÙØ§:").
"She makes it out of silver or a thin knife like a scalpel; if she pressed the tongue with it and showed you the tumor, you would take gauze and insert it into the throat to pull as much as possible outside without pulling any part of the tonsils." (The translation is speculative due to lack of context for 'she' or the process being described.)
"Then she cuts it with this device, which resembles scissors without a pivot point in the mouth where each blade is sharpened to an extremely fine edge and made from Indian iron or Damascus steel:" (The translation is speculative due to lack of context for 'she' or the process being described.)
Indeed, this device did not come to the scene; only cut it with this blade's image:.
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other; after cutting through the first piece with a single glance, it cuts through the next of this type of incision with ease, then washing off the surgical residue with cold water or vinegar-water solution.
He presents a bleeding wound that is cleansed with water enriched by the skins of pomegamo seeds or tamarind leaves, similar to such ligatures until it stops bleeding; sometimes other tumors may be found in the bowels, which should also be incised as was mentioned for the two incisions.
A woman treated for a tumor that had grown inside her bowels, which nearly occluded the colon and caused breathing difficulties through a narrow passage; she was unable to eat or drink.
The death was witnessed if only one or two days had passed, and the tumor had grown out branches until they emerged through her nostrils; hastily pressing on one of them, she inserted a pincers into it and pulled out a piece that was suitable for examination.
Then she cut it where she realized from the nose hole, and then did so with what protruded from another hole in the nose. She opened her mouth and pressed her tongue, then inserted a needle into the same bump. From this, she cut off some of it and blood flowed out.
The woman untied her robe and from that moment to the hour, she drank water but did not receive food. From there, a lump was cut for a long period of time until he passed away and it shriveled instead of being completely removed.
The lump inside the throat was opened, and it stopped increasing then traveled away from her location, but I did not know what Allah had done to her afterwards.
Chapter Seventeen and Thirty. (This appears to be a section title within the textbook.)
In cutting the lump of the lady. (This seems to be an image caption in Arabic regarding surgical treatment on a female patient's lump.)
The one called Pommel if it fell into the throat and swelled up, being a flat white pillar is called a column; if it were thick at the bottom and curved it would be called an apple, as we mentioned in sectioning, but the treatment did not succeed. (This excerpt explains different names for lumps based on their shape and position in relation to throat surgery.)
I saw a hot tumor from which it was appropriate to cut, and what came out of it was in the form of a circle, without length or color (reddish), blackness, or any sensation; it was proper not to touch it.
If the disease appeared with bloody discharge and a certain length, it was proper for the patient to sit in sunlight, clamp their tongue with the instrument as described by him, then expel the worm through an orange.
They are attracted downward and cut with one of the two instruments mentioned in the lute sections; it is proper not to cut more than necessary, as excessive cutting can damage speech and hearing without reason.
After the cutting as described in the lute sections, one should use a remedy from Kiha without fear or hesitation; in this context, it refers to using a strong medication and placing the affected area on your stone table.
Then clamp the tongue with the instrument as mentioned, then take the strong water that you described in section Kiha and knead a non-lit wax into it to make it neither thick nor brittle, filling the mold of this instrument here: (the description continues)
The part of the body where you place the medicine has a hollow like that of a spoon, and you put the apparatus with the drug on it directly onto the wound alongside to allow saliva from within its cavity to flow into the surrounding area.
Then you hold the medicine and squeeze it onto the wound for about half an hour until you see that it has darkened and settled, or if you wish to use a muslin cloth soaked in the drug on its edge.
And the tincture with the muslin cloth inserted into a tube until it sticks to the wound, do that repeatedly until you reach the desired amount of grapevine, then leave it to dry and precipitate after three or four days, and if necessary reapply the medicine.
After the person has mopped around the grapevine with a syringe soaked in olive oil and dried what surrounds it of medicine, then they are rinsed with cold water and treated from outside using compresses and inside using enemas until relieved; this type of treatment is calming and distracts from anxiety.
The nurses also treated it as gently as possible and made incisions according to this type, taking fenugreek, violets, sage, pepper, hellebore, cumin, and similar herbs, gathering them all or some of them in the required amount and soaking them in water.
The hole spreads and is lined with a piece of tin, as the mechanism enclosing it on this type is made from silver or copper.
The end which is inserted into the patient's mouth causes steam to rise into the funnel until it swells enough and then repeatedly expands, creating this treatment at the first occurrence of the tumor.
It is common for it to increase in the tumor and should be done when her scalding boil recedes, so that this device does not have a spoon-shaped handle with an eggshell attached that will burn the patient's mouth.
Because the eggshell prevents the steam from burning the mouth, it is a good treatment accompanied by its safety.
Chapter 80 and 32.
Regarding the extraction of stones from bile ducts and what arises in them other than that.
Often bone or fish scales or something else appears in the gallbladebut it should be extracted with a probe under sunlight after wrapping around the tongue.
To see what is in the gallbladder and that which did not appear to you but passed through it, prepare for the treatment before its food decomposes within its stomach, so that whatever passes from it with belching or obstructs the patient or a piece of cloth may be seen.
Or an adherent lump of hard bread or a piece from the fine sea-cotton is fastened with a thread then passed through if it reaches the location of the bile ducts, pulls the string quickly to do that several times.
Often stones or bone adhere and pass out, but if they do not exit as mentioned above then a metal instrument is used on this image:.
It is thicker than pyloric stenosis with a narrowing that the patient enters into his gallbladder gently and lifts up its head slightly, keeping it away from touching his larynx so as not to cause belching or push the stone or bone out with it; or the doctor inserts his hand into it.
For inserting the diseased part, it is best to know its location and move it down or pull it up with a device as much as possible until it comes out.
Chapter Nine and Thirty-Two.
From the exudation of the gallbladculed in the throat.
If the gallbladder is treated as we mentioned in section on incision, then consider medication treatment if it does not heal; however, when examining the patient's throat at sunset after tying his tongue with the device I described for you.
If your gaze is placed on the gallbladder, attract it with a small syringe or thin tube; if you cannot do so by these means only then take a hollow tube and insert it near the diseased throat close to the gallbladder and then insert into the hollow tube itself a sealed container heated with fire.
Do this repeatedly until the disease is relieved of water each day, then he takes a filled vessel with cold water and opens his mouth in it and pants into it without spitting out any drops and moves the water after that when done.
If the gallbladder is felt to water, it will not exit as we described; then dry out the throat with urine and cholesterol using the device I mentioned in the pipe cleaner do that repeatedly until it drops.
The procedure in the ear involves taking a bowl of hot charcoal and placing it with a cover on it having an attachment screwed into that hole, then the patient receives the treatment by putting something in their ear through the tube, and they close their mouth until no longer gas comes out to know that the ear treatment has reached its target.
The eardrop is falling on the ear, and if it doesn't fall then repeatedly pouring the treatment for thirst with vinegar, garlic, without drinking water should not be allowed to drain out, this is an image of a device that attracts the drop from the ear.
It is like clay but what you see here it has this attachment that enters the ear and its end resembles a bird's beak with a sharpened blade if pressed on something, it does not leave behind anything.
Another device that grabs the tongue and a wide ring of iron so it goes into the mouth, leaving the mouth open involuntarily for the patient who cannot remove it until driven off:.
Title of the Device that Opens the Mouth on This Scale with Its Eye.
Chapter Forty-Four.
He should make an incision in the cavity for removing and detaching the tumors.
The tumors have many kinds, deeply seated as mentioned one by one in this book; they differ from each other in their cavities and the method of excision. Two types among these are particularly like each other in nature but vary greatly in terms of depth and moisture content.
The second type pertains to body locations because the tumor occurring in the head is not like a benign tumor in the anus, nor is one found in a location near the thigh similar to a benign tumor in any joint; each case requires specific action.
Regarding tumors, they should only be excised after the wax has fully matured and completed its course; however, some must be detached before full maturation similar to those close to joints.
This is because if a tumor occurs near a joint and takes time to heal, it may cause damage to the ligaments or nerves of that joint, which could result in prolonged healing for the affected tissue or the presence of a tumor near another organ.
Because if you delay the cauterization until the wound heals, the main part becomes near-edged and only the tumor must be treated not completely matured to prevent infection from spreading into the cavity through pus excretion.
It is at most not healed, and you should know the time for treating tumors that have fully matured, which is when there is a lump, sweating fever, pallor, weakness, trembling of the head of the tumor, and other signs.
It should be expected that the cauterization is below the position of the tumor if possible, as it would facilitate draining to the lower part or in a deeper location from the tumor and more severe symptoms; the cauterisation should proceed along the body if the tumors are towards the hands and arms.
For the muscles, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels at all levels without exception, if they are cauterized according to this position; but if the tumor is in the meatier areas, leave it untreated.
Until it is fully matured, as we have mentioned before, if you cut open its scab too early, the pus will flow from it and be much foul-smelling and filthy, and perhaps the skin of the wound may adhere to it or become grayish, and some tumors may appear on the body at need.
You should use one incision for small tumors and a wide incision or multiple incisions as large as the size of the tumor, and it may be necessary to cut through some tumors that require cutting through the skin like an incised wound if it has become such.
It was necessary to cut like in many diseases and abscesses, some of which have an incision with three sides and others are cut into the shape of a sheepskin parchment.
There are those in which a cylindrical incision and crescentic incisions, similar to other types of cuts, are used, but if it does not have the head like flattened tumors, then only a simple incision should be made, especially if the tumor is large and has had extensive growth, so that no pus bursts out all at once.
But remove part of it and tighten the tumor to another day, then also remove some pus; do this repeatedly until all are removed.
Especially if the illness is weak or a woman who is pregnnant or a small child or an elderly man; often the animal spirits resolve with the removal of pus, although sometimes the patient may die and you should be very cautious about this matter.
After removing these tumors, it is necessary to cleanse the wound and if the tumor incision was small or the opening simple, use a linen bandage or silk thread; if the tumor was large with many openings.
It is necessary to insert into each incision until they meet, and if the tumor has been cut through or narrowed, cover it with non-moist silk thread or catgut from outside.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate bandages until healed, if there is bleeding during your work use cold water and vinegar after drinking them orally for a few times at the site of bleeding.
"Indeed, the treatment for hemorrhage should employ measures and remedcuies as we have described in numerous locations within this book, so at a time of winter, it was necessary to treat the tumor by using an alcoholic tincture and hot oil.
"She should be placed there, and if it is summer with areas of inflammation, she ought to take the tincture by drinking water or oil mixed together cold until the third day as we have mentioned required for the tumor to dissolve and cleanse.
"She should use what is required for healing until recovery, which includes knowing tumor treatment as outlined and the method of detailed instruction on how to bind each tumor treated in a summarized manner.
"Surgical Section Forty-Four.
"In the case of tumors that appear on the scalp.
"Small tumors appear on the scalp, known as types of lesions covered with protective capsules; they are comparable to hen's nests and their varieties are numerous including greasy ones and some that resemble fatty secretions.
From this, a moisture similar to resin and plaster arises, and from it comes a hardened mass that is entirely safe in its cavity and the discharge of which does not cause obstruction when passing through its channel.
The work in its cavity is first cleared with the tool that appears after this one, called the probe, until you determine what arises from it to be a moisture causing a longitudinal channel along the entire length of this image:.
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~, if the moisture drains it will empty the sac where that moisture was present and cut all of it off, leaving very little behind in case any remains.
Then, immerse the gauze in hot water if needed or in saltwater and fill with it the wound, leaving it for another day so that it will consume what remains of the sac; then reapply the gauze a second and third time if necessary.
Until it is understood that there is nothing left from the sac then treat the wound with dressings until cured, and if a tumor arises resembling fat tissue causing an opening in this image:.
A solid hole and the cannulas in the wound are extracted from all sides, and scrape it on one side where the abscess is located; if you encounter an obstinate vein, then do as I described for that, and likewise do so at the tumor if it is encapsulated.
Treat it as I mentioned, and make a hole in the encapsulated tumor easier because it has little blood and moisture, and some of these tumors located on the head are without any fluid in some people; thus, holes have not been made therein.
The head of an old woman had a hard, white tumor like a polished stone that could not be broken by hitting it with a fist; the other tumors occurrec in the head are different from this and appear in boys' heads.
When ear pus drains, simply make a hole in its lobes to facilitate the discharge of material downward and treat it as appropriate from available therapies.
Section Two and Forty. (This seems to be just a section title with no additional context, so translation remains unchanged.)
When making a hole in the tumors that appear on the neck, these tumors frequently occur also on the throat and under the breasts, between the nipples, throughout the body, with those appearing on the neck being one type that are numerous and arise from one another, some of which proliferate. (This appears to be a description of types or patterns of growth related to tumors in medical terminology.)
Every pig of these has a special place inside, as with the lesions and head tumors as we have described, and there are many types of these pigs that are stone-like or from which evaporation occurs, and some are treacherous and do not respond to treatment.
What I noticed was that it felt good upon touch and its appearance was close to the skin color, moving in all directions without being torn by the neck tendon or nail or vein, nor was there any fat. It was necessary to scrape it with a simple groove from top to bottom of the body in this shape from line ~j~ to line ~b~:.
Shave it from all sides and stretch the skin with a pin or two pins as much as necessary as we said in head tumors, slightly pulled out, slightly removed, on the back not to tear veins or nerves, so that the forceps are not too tightly closed.
Lest your hand do not overdo the cutting or concern about the injury leads to tearing what is not necessary, as it tears veins and nerves causing difficulty in working at the wound, a coagulum crushed or some poultices that stop the blood.
The wound was left until the tumor settled in and the injury rested, then it became concerned with healing; when the blood stops at that point, return to your work until it empties, then inspect with your spatula if it remains; if so, small pincers cut and cleanse.
Originally, the pig had a large scar which should not be cut from it but tied with a thick sinew and left until it fell off harmlessly; then cover the wn with melted cinnabar and have dipped in an Egyptian plaster. Then treat it accordingly.
And if the pig was cut entirely, it should gather wound's threads and tie them within an hour after realizing there is no residue of fat; but if you see that a piece has remained as part of the pig bone, then remove it.
It should be aimed to cut her off at the root, and wash and stitch as previously mentioned; for pigs that were exposed to moisture have been tied with a simple binding where you see signs of maturity, so make the bindings hang downwards as we said.
Then one uses the goat suckling with the Egyptian bandage in a similar manner so it can consume what remains of the rot, until one sees that the wound has been thoroughly cleansed by treatment with bandages imbued with cured meat until healing occurs.
Chapter Three and Forty-four.
Within the larynx, a tumor occurs internally in the esophagamoesophageal junction.
The ancients mentioned this fissure in the larynx and I have not seen it performed here in our land, nor does their methodology match what they claim. However, those skilled in animal slaughtering should avoid a cleft of the larynx when performing such tasks.
To make all the airways and lungs sick, or those with an inflamed tumor in the throat, esophagus, or trachea, if not due to a blockage within the duct, it is necessary to utilize the fissure of the larynx for escape from the obstruction that causes asphyxiation.
It was deemed that we should make the fissure of the larynx beneath three rings from the duct or four small slits across two circles to a distance wherein the slot in the sagittus is not on the edge but rather centralized, and this position agreebespoke for the incision.
Because he had no flesh and the blood vessels were distant, it was fitting for the surgeon to widen the esophagatal skin with a pumice stone and then scratch the skin until reaching the vessel; if he saw anything from it.
Then he would scratch the incision that we described, and infer from scratching the vessel with the bulge that comes out of it along with what throbs and where the sound cuts off, leaving the wound open for a while if the time in which constriction was feared had passed. Collected the skin over the wound.
And he cut it off by himself from the glandular, then used medications that cause meat to grow until cured, said who composed this book: the explanation of these words is only if they saw the disease as having closed its esophagus with one of these tumors that were mentioned.
And the disease appeared to them as if it would die, so they scratched the larynx for it to breathe on the site of the ward and take some breaths and be relieved from death; but rather ordered to leave the wound open until the period of the disease was completed which lasted about three days.
At that time, they ordered the stitching of the wound and its treatment until healed, which I observed was that her servant took a knife and sent it to her neck only to cut off part of her windpipe and bandaged it for his treatment. She was found eating as if she were choked and when the wound was revealed, it turned out to be so.
I found the blood flowing from the wound, running with a belief that she was not severed and bleeding only from her nose which came out of the ward. She promptly tended to close up and heal it until healed, showing nothing but a little cough to the servant.
And he improved to better conditions, from which it can be said that there was no danger in the laryngeal incision.
Chapter Four and Forty-Four.
In the incision on the tumor that is shown in the larynx from outside and called phlegm of the lateral wall.
This tumor called phlegm of the larder is a large tumor on the body and it occurs frequently in women, being of two types.
Whether it is natural or whether it is acquired, the natural one has no cure and the acquired one comes in two forms; one resembling fatty tissue and the other similar to a malignant tumor involving intricate blood vessels with incision risks. It is not fitting to expose it with raw iron except what has been extracted from it and searched with the probe, then hammered on anvil, resembling fatty tissue, and not attached to anything in the body was separated by tearing as when torn away from substances. It is taken out enclosed in a bag, if it was in one; otherwise, search all of them and treat the affected area as necessary.
The Fifth and Forty-Fourth Chapter.
On examining types of substances.
There are many types of substances, and all have been mentioned in the division; here we inform you of the difference between tissue and extraction when there is a problem - I say that the extracted matter has heat with it, burns, and fearsome pains until the fever subsides. The tincture completes the fever and pain, whereas the tissue does not have heat or burns or pangs; it is wrapped in a linen bag with its own vessel being of the body color, initially like lentils and becoming like poppy seeds before enlarging and shrinking.
He was on two types: one, fatty; or if it is a dewiness and the colors of the moisture are abundant as mentioned in the division above, then if it reaches treatment of the lesion it should first be examined and scrubbed with the instrument called scoop.
He measured the size of the tumor, then removed the scoop and looked at what came out from it; if clear moisture with a color similar to what was mentioned above in the previous tumors comes out, or if nothing came out after using the scoop, assume that it is fatty.
He extracted a firmer cut from this image, as I informed you; label it with the syringes and drainage of skin gently from all sides, preserving it in a bag if possible to extract it correctly through the lesion.
If the bag leaks during work and cannot sufficiently extract it, this is often shown by a piece-by-piece extraction until nothing remains; if anything remains, or more than usual, it suggests that there was an issue with the lesion treatment.
If the swelling persists, gently cleanse the wound at its edge with sharp scalpel incisions and tighten the wound while applying a substance to extingamoheal the abscess, treating it completely until healed; this case required significant stitching and was treated accordingly.
If you experience persistent or non-persistent bleeding, treat the affected area with a powdered ointment and leave it compressed for two to three days until the wound heals and blood clots form; then return if any remnants of sores are left.

In images of tools. (This could refer to an image caption indicating that there are illustrations or depictions of surgical instruments in that section of the book.)
Those that are in use and made from them, there are three types: large, medium, and small. (Here the translation is referring to surgical instruments or tools being described in a section of Albucasis's textbook.)
Image of a large instrument. (This would be an image caption directly describing a depiction of a large surgical tool, as it might appear within the context of an Arabic medical manuscript on surgery like that by Albucasis.)

Image of nails and there are many types because the simple ones have one head, while the large ones include three kinds: plain, round shanks, and small; blind nails with three kinds including those with heads and those that are curved with heads. There are three types and among them the nails with triple heads, and there are three kinds where all of these must be placed in their respective place; image of a simple large nail.

Images of lancets used to draw blood and there are three types because they are large, medium, and small. Image of a large lancet.
They are made either from iron or copper and slightly elongated as you see, they must be small and large types of lancets to draw blood quickly when necessary and without medication.
However, they are not used to draw blood from every part of the body but only in meat locations such as thighs and shanks, arms muscles and chest, and parts like them wet meaty organs.
Other small types of them, resembling pearl barley as in this image:.
He cuts the blood if it leaks from the site of fissure or when cutting veins, and a bulge is formed in this image:
The Seventh Section and Forty.
In treating the animals of men.
The one which resembles the animals of women may swell like the animals of some men when full until it looks as pale and weakened as the animal of a woman, so disliking this he should scrape on the skin with an upward stroke in this manner: (The text implies that Albucasis is describing a surgical procedure for treating conditions resembling female physiology or symptoms in male patients).
From line ~b~ to line ~c~: (This implies that Albucasis may be referring to a specific area on an image, diagram, or textual section within the surgical treatise). Then remove all the pus, then fill the wound with anointment ointment, then close the edges of the wound with a needle and treat it until healed; as long as the animal descends to below and rests its bones as shown for women. (This excerpt is most likely detailing Albucasis' methodology for treating certain conditions or performing surgery, involving pus removal, medication application, wound closure, and aftercare).
It was necessary to scrape along the upper edges with two scrapes resembling crescent shapes, each one connecting to the other at their end until the larger stroke encompasses the smaller on this image: (This suggests that Albucasto is describing a specific technique or pattern for surgical intervention, likely related to wound closure or contouring). From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then exfoliate the skin that is between the stitches and extract the fatty tissue; use what we mentioned regarding threading, needles, and sutures, along with anything else required for treatment until healed.
It was not possible to accommodate the appropriate portion for you from the concern of bleeding or by applying a tourniquet; it should be covered with compressed cotton in a conforming cast and left until consumed fat remains, then treat it until healed.
The eighth section and forty-fourth.
In the area of tumors that are under the abdomen.
These tumors under the abdomen are of a type known as hard sausages, enclosed in casings; from which some contain moisture that should be drained in this manner: make a slit-like incision on it like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~, if all the contents of the tumor have been drained over time and covered with flat cotton, leave it for another day then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the conforming cast until healed; if the tumor is of a type known as sausage nodes, made an incision on it like we mentioned for sausages, either expanding the wound to reach adipose tissue and apply what was described in that section.
Chapter 9 and 40.
In the channel where a tumor is presented by a vessel or vein, called aneurysm.
If a vessel or vein is injured and the adjacent skin swells frequently, it may present with a tumor as well as exhibiting an aneurysm in the vein.
The signs that are recognized as tumor and aneurysm if the vessel or vein were previously affected, it would be a long mass grouped within the body depth if it was from a vessel, and you can feel with your finger like there is a crack in it.
And those that are from a vein, the tumor would be rounded in appearance on the body surface; cutting these tumors is risky, especially if they are in the groin, breast, and neck areas and in many other body places where it was very severe to avoid treating them with iron.
Also, there were cases in the arms or head where it was very important to avoid; what occurred with this was that a swelling of a vessel's mouth broke open in the skin, creating a long crack then opening up with pores and spilling out the vessel.
Until it opens, then insert a needle underneath and pass it to the other side, squeezing the vessel with a threaded string at two points that you are familiar with in the arteries of the pulse on both sides until the blood flowing through is expelled.
The tumor is then resolved, and the treatment that produces pus is used until the sutures fall out; it is then treated with bandages agreed upon for this reason until healed.
The tumor was previously created by puncturing a vein, and it should be grasped with your hand as much as possible from the tumor with skin; then insert a needle below from the position you have held in your hand and pass a thread through until it is expelled on the other side. Then tie the tumor with a good knot as you mentioned for grapevine tying from both ends on the thread, I feared that the threads would slip so insert another needle with a different thread underneath the entire tumor at the intersection of the first needcuce.
Tightened your threads at four positions, then punctured the tumor in the center until it expelled what was inside; then cut off a strip of skin that remained attached and apply an ointment with oil to it. Then the treatment with bandages and plasters is applied until healed.
Chapter Fifty.
In the worm that shows from the spinal cord.
The tumor in the blood vessel and vein is also shown as the tumor in the nerve if it occurs due to a blow, excessive fatigue or something similar; more so at the lumbar levels and sacrum.
And in each location, the joints move and the tumor protrudes with a color similar to that of the skin surface; it is more often painless and if pressed hard, the patient feels a tingling sensation but the tumors are not grouped together deep within the body.
But it is under the skin and moves to all sides, neither forward nor backward; in joints it should not be exposed with iron as it may occur at a time and also what was found on the head or face.
Pulling the skin off, if the tumor was small it could be cut at its base with a knife and if large, tied with thread, slit open then removed and the wound stitched together and treated until healed.
Chapter on Surgical Operations and Their Application (Arabic text: Ø§ÙÙØµÙ Ø§ÙØ­Ø§Ø¯Ù ÙØ§ÙØ®ÙØ³Ùn)
In the section of the thigh presented in the abdamenon.
It is common for many people to have a type of worm called "al-fatr" similar to earthworms, with its origin being fine and head thick; its teeth may transform into small ones while the largest predominate.
I witnessed a man with two threads in his abdomen that resemble worms; their origin being fine, they may have transformed and shed their teeth while always secreting moisture. Cutting them weighed about eighty-eight pounds, the other sixteen.
The work of cutting it made one see that the affliction was moist, and the thread's color resembled a fine wet white origin; when cut with a flat blaerit often gushed out blood plentifully into your pot placed on fire.
If your blood flowed profusely, I saw the worm tremble and recoiled at being cut with an iron thread; it tightened on the thread described earlier, left for two days, then tightened the iron again without loosening.
Whenever the tumor is affected by the caustic until it breaks off from its base without support, the original tumor becomes less as some of it breaks and shrinks, especially in the abdangle but may only be reduced to half or part thereof.
Then the tumor is filled with linen soaked in wine, and then it is treated until the wound heals; beware that a slight touch may cause parts of the tumor to break off, for they are like cancerous lumps and come to mind as cancer after this mention.
The second chapter fifty.
In the treatment of aneurysms.
An aneurysm is due to a rupture of the intestinal wall that allows the blood or pus to escape, or from bleeding originating from a vessel or artery on its exterior surface, or by inflammation underneath it; or from blood escaping through a duct.
When it is a rupture and escape of blood, the tumor's color resembles that of body tissue and is soft without pain, presenting itself in various stages. And if it was a pus expulsion, the condition would be quite different from what we described; if you palpate it with your fingers, it disappears then reappears and may have an abscess with extensive swelling upon entering the bath or intense fatigue, but usually it is soft.
There is no absence if you bind it with your hand, nor excess nor deficiency; previously by blood, it showed the tumor turning to blackness, previously by liver fat, the tumor was solid and confirmed for a little while.
It was previously soft to touch, and in that case it appeared as a secretion from the blood vessels or veins or wind; it should be ceased from treatment for fear and delusion, as I have told you in the chapter where I mentioned tumors originating from blood vessels and veins.
It was previously a secretion from the bladvein or thrombosis; it should be stopped by binding itself and standing erect, then learn all around the secretion with a string. Then it is commanded to be lifted between your hands on its head, then scrape with a flat spatula around the secretion at the position you learned from the string; extend in the middle of the tumor towards above with a large cautery and tie the scraped point with a wire using strong iron binding.
The ligament ends are knots, then it opens in the middle of the hardened tumor over the ligament and your little finger enters into it. If you find that it has taken hold of the knots, push the pouch inside until you find a thorn, prick it with a needle.
Cut off its stem, if you encounter a blood vessel or lympertude, return to your work and insert two strong threads into the needles. The sutures enter where you created the swollen tumor; tighten them so that they pull in four places on the skin.
If you remove the suture and leave it in place until the swoln flesh rots and falls from itself, or if its edge frays and rots, then treat it with a bandage as necessary until healed; this was a secreted tumor within it.
Or if the tumor swells and needs to be punched as we said, and blood or fluid is found in it, then treat it with a bandage at the site.
The third section fifty. (This seems like a section title indicating "Section III" followed by the number "50".)
In the treatment of cancer.
We mentioned the classification of cancer types and how to treat them with medications, warning against treating with iron lest it leaks out, as well as mentioning uterine cancer and caution in its treatment.
The foremost mentioned that when cancer is in a position where it can be entirely removed, as with cancers of the limbs or lower extremities, from parts capable of exudation, and especially if small and initial; however, if large, one should not approach them.
Whoever managed to be cured of it, I have not seen anything like that before, and the work in such a case as we mentioned should progress from darkening at first to spreading if it is in the chest filling with fluid.
Then the disease presents a stage where one can work on it, then receives in the cancer of snails that heals for him and spreads from all sides with skin examination until nothing remains of its traces; blood is left to clot slowly without cutting quickly.
However, if the patient is in shock and bleeding profuseblock all blood flow using your hands or whatever means you haveat work induce a large loss of blood by cutting an artery or leaking blood from veins until it stops, then treat with all possible remedies until recovery.
Chapter Four and Fifty.
In the treatment of hernias.
We have been informed in the previous section about types of hydropathy, how to recognize signs for each type and treatment with medications; only iron treats the hemorrhagic type exclusively and not the sanguine or choleric types.
It's unfortunate if you treated the hemorrhagic type of hernia with medications and it did not improve; then there may be an underlying deficiency or another disease like cancer, which is present as well.
If you have diarrhea or constipamoority towards that, treat with iron; it's likely the illness has consumed strength and is not an other disease except hernia without being a boy or elderly, and do not let your work be in a state where you can examine the condition standing while holding it between your hands. The patient lies on his back and presses his hands to the abductors; he pushes water downward towards the affected side, then takes a hook-shaped instrument as shown in this picture:
The two forearm-long handles, apart from the hook-shaped instrument (except that it has some small flaws to prevent slippage during operation into the cavity), and if there is any discharge, expel it before inserting the plug through the intestines.
It was necessary to push the tube about three finger-lengths downward from the stomach above the anus, so that if there had been a plug before liver disease, you would make the incision easily from the anal area by three fingers, and if it came before typhoid fever, you would do the incision on the right side with about three fingers.
Also, the incision should be on the side that the patient desires to lie upon so as not to let curiosity slip onto such a weak spot, then puncture it with a skin hook and insert the instrument into that incision while raising your hand.
With the instrument between the skin and subcutaneous tissue as if you were sliding it, make an incision to the depth of a finger or slightly deeper, then puncture until the instrument reaches an empty spot where water is located, then remove it and insert into that hole using the instrument shown in this image.
He was a tube-like structure made from fine tubes, either of silver or brass or lead-tin soldered alloy with small holes at the bottom and three holes on its sides as you see.
He has placed a capillary tube on the pig bladder structure as seen in this illustration.
At the top end, there is a pump mechanism that if water reaches it, will drain from its reservoir onto the device; thus, in an average amount of time as you would empty it more than necessary at that moment because the animal may die due to disintegration of his spirit.
Or it shows him close to death, but empty out as much as its capacity and what indicates on the state of the animal from the strength of its pulse and color, then the device exits and contains water, that is, it captures from its reservoir.
Due to the skin that holds the hole on the animal it indicated should be attached in that manner, then the device returns another day if you see the patient possibly due to that.
Also, water will leach out slowly; do it for a few days, and you will be on your neck while preventing mistakes until only clear water remains. If the wound is still open, leave some of the water behind and bury it in hot sand to treat effectively.
It is heavily absorbed in the bath and sun, make it endure thirst, treat it with dried medicines until healed; let him rest on the gallbladder, liver, and intestines after water expulsion as described above.
Chapter Five Hundred.
In treating infants who produce and expel unstrained urine or have a small opening, or not in the right position.
Some boys may expel from the mother's womb and scrotum unstrained, it is best to be proactive in making a hole at birth hour.
With a very fine pin on this picture:.
Then place a fine needle in the hole, connect it with thread and hold for three days or four until urine passes through again; if the pin is lost, use that position for urination so that it does not close up.
As for those whose hole is narrow, they are treated with iron as we have mentioned for many days until it expands; and among them those whose hole is not in the usual place, from them comes what causes the pus at the end of convalescence so that one cannot stand to sit near.
Until the inflammation raises his hand above and no longer produces what was previously known as discharge, a condition so severe that he cannot reach the belly on foot in order to cure it by raising the disease onto its back.
Then his hernia is extended by your left hand greatly and the head of the inflamm ions is smeared with ointment or a sharp surgical pen as if you had cut out something in its place to be like a hernia, and the hole falls into the middle on time.
And by your work, blood may flow abundantly making it vulnerable for cutting and treating the wound until healing occurs,.
Chapter six hundred fifty.
In the pustule that presents in the skin and hernia and leprosy and putrefaction and adhesion of the skin to the hernia.
Often, this pustule appears in the sore and is a spot of red swelling, which can be either benign or malignant; if it's not malignamoinal, one should mark it with a gentle cauterizer.
It cuts until it cleans the entire thing, then applies a soaked cotton in Egyptian plaster, and subsequently treats it with lemonwood plaster until recovery; if the pustule is malignant, one should use this after cutting and scraping.
It was a pustule in an untreated wound, and some pustules were from inside the dressing while others were outside; one should first remove those originating from within, then treat those on the exterior if they expand.
Because you may have treated them together without securing the dressing, and they might also present in females as blackness or rot within the dresspertise all that which has turned black to cure it before decay sets in.
Then treat it with honey mixed with crushed pomegranate peel and cinnamon, then use all remedies until recovery; to address bleeding depicted in this image:...
Thus, the meat is beneficial for both cases of blood loss and wounds when they are infected; if put into a container made of lead and brought in through the channel at the time it should be introduced via a tube of glass to treat the illness, and as for the adhesion of the cover on the kidney.
This adhesion only occurs when it was properly covered and should not have been tied, and its attachment has previously been exposed to a wound or tumor that should be removed with tweezamoletto until the knot is loosened and the kidney freed from all sides.
The difficulty in distinguishing it during examination is that one should extract something from the kidney and its cover, as the cover may be thin if it has been pierced quickly; then separate the cover from the kidney with fine scars, which have been immersed in cold water so they do not adhere.
Then it is treated with a compressive beverage until healed.
Chapter Seven Hundred and Fifty.
In the purification of boys and treatment for what they exhibit as mistakes.
Binding is not something other than separating connections in surgical treatments except that it was done by our will and used with boys specifically, to depict the best work within it.
The easiest way to achieve safety, I say that the initials were not mentioned in any of their books because they were not used in their laws; it is only what we have obtained.
In the experiment, I found that the audience of craftsmen and barbers use disinfection with the cautery stick and scissors, and they also use the needle threaded with a string and cut with nail clippers. I tried all these methods.
I did not find a better method of disinfection with scissors and threaded needle than disinfection with cautery stick because the skin would often suffer from the caustic effect, as there are two layers to the skin; if one layer is cut, the lower layer remains.
I was forced to cut another and the patient complained of pain during disinfection with cautery stick because it did not agree with splitting the incision, as perhaps it entered into its hole; whereas disinfection with nail clippers may cause skin damage or spoil your work or the child's skin is naturally short.
They often produce such results without the need for disinfection, and I have seen that; however, the experiment with scissors and threaded needle proved to be preferable because the scissor cut is proportional to the incision required so as not to harm the hair above from what would be below.
At times, your hand has been sized for the two shears that were cut to one measure at once during the suspension of the rope thread resembling a wall for the unraveling of threads from all sides without any error in the mark. The purpose of the work is firstly to deceive the young ones.
Especially if someone only slightly understands that you are just binding the thread in unraveling and telling them to come back another day, then free it secretly with any method they can think of and whatever they accept mentally, then stop it between your hands while standing upright.
It should not be that you sit or hide the scissors in your pocket or under your foot so as to avoid eye contact with young people and no tools, then insert your hand into unraveling it and inflate the skin until the head of the thread comes out.
Then cleanse what has accumulated in it from dirt, then bind the position taught with a double thread and then attach below that slightly another knot, then grip with your thumb and index finger the lower tie firmly and cut between the two ties. Then raise the skin to the surface quickly and remove the puncture wound, allowing the blood to drain for a short while as it is better with less risk of infection; then dry it using a moistened sponge or dust it with burned pomegeen powder which has been found to be superior.
Then raise the skin to the surface quickly and remove the puncture wound, allowing the blood to drain for a short while as it is better with less risk of infection; then dry it using a moistened sponge or dust it with burned pomegeen powder which has been found to be superior. Then, apply a compress made from white bread soaked in rosewater mixed with the top layer of red rose oil and leave it on for another day before proceedestepping up the treatment to healing completely.
This is an image of the scalpel used for sterilization:.
The incision is made with a no-jerk sharp scalpel, the lengths of both blades are equal to the length of the handles; and during sterilization, if all or part of the skin fold is cut through, it should be extended by an inch using fingers before bleeding occurs.
It is cut at a forty-five degree angle, if it cannot be grasped by your finger, grab it with tweezebrushing it off, let it go for three days and the swelling under the puncture remains bloated and flabby until the hot tumor settles in.
Cut according to what suits you, and save a piece from the site of incision as that does not harm it; treat it by applying pressure on the wound with the methods we described in the article on suture techniques.
If cutting a piece of skin over the specified amount causes it to shrink, do not harm it too much; treat it as we mentioned until it heals.

Urinary retention in the bladder is due to a blockage from stones or dried blood or scum and suchlike; if treated as we described in the methods of wound care mentioned above.
And the urine has not passed, and it appears that a blockage from stones had previously occurred in the bladamoen; let the disease settle on its shanks while lying down then sit with your feet raised and extend your abdomen to your back and grasp the illness itself as much as possible.
Therefore, push the stone out of the bladermoen so that urine may pass as we mentioned; if it has not passed and the condition worsens in the disease, then use the device called Catharter depicted here:.
The excerpt translated into English is as follows: "Create from silver, fine delicate tube similar to a bird'amoeboid feather in length on the scale of half an inch, with a thin rim at its head and attracting the urine so that it takes two twisted strings attached at one end by wool or good quality cotton.
The translated excerpt reads as follows: "The end of the string enters at the bottom of the catheter and is pushed inside with a pump if necessary, until it goes into the tube and seals it like a plug, then the catheter is greased with oil or butter or egg white and the patient sits on a chair.
The excerpt, when translated into English, is as follows: "The catheter and the drain are soaked in wet resin or oil and water until they are saturated; then gently insert the catheter into the drain until it reaches its source, bend the drain upwards towards the secretion, and push the catheter inside.
The translated excerpt is: "Until the drain has been bent, and then push the catheter into it until nearing the seat; if a male draws downward, pull out the catheter from within and continue pulling until reaching the bladder so that the patient feels an empty sensation.
However, this level is made because the tube through which urine flows in it trembles, then the thread is stretched with a little wool, so that the urine follows the wool, then it comes out and drains the urine, and returns to the thimble.
Tofle still does this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Niney-Fifty.
How to insert the catheter into the bladard. (Note: I'm assuming "Ø§ÙØ²Ø±Ø§ÙØ©" is a typo and should be "Ø§ÙÙØ·Ø±Ø©".)
And the instruments that perform this are made from silver or ivory and have a long tube on paper-thin plate to channel water and medicines, known as a catheter, here is its image:. (Note: The translation assumes "Ø§ÙØ²Ø±Ø§ÙØ©" should be "Ø§ÙÙØ·Ø±Ø©".)
They are made from silver or ivory and have a long tube on paper-thin plate entirely closed with two holes at one end and one hole at the other, as seen here. (Note: "Ø§ÙÙÙÙ" is assumed to be a typo for "Ø§ÙØ±ÙØ§Ø¦Ù".)
The central position where the lever is placed to fill it without more until something attracts the moisture which then, if pushed with it, moves towards a distance as far as one would make cleanliness equipment that throws oil in naval battles. (Note: This translation assumes "Ø§ÙÙØ¯ÙØ¹ÙÙÙn" refers to lever-based mechanisms and may need contextual clarification.)
If you wish to drain moisture from the gallblader, insert one end of the catheter into the moisture and use a pump to draw it upwards; then the moisture will be drawn into the bottom of the catheter as described in the chapter on catheters, and then the moisture is pushed out using the pump.
This moisture reaches the gallbladder to a certain extent until it is felt by the illness, and this image also shows how it penetrates into the gallbladder:.
The catheter is made of silver or ivory, with a small flap at the top and a slit underneebelow where the tube goes; then it takes gallbladder bladders and places the moisture that one wants to inject into the gallbladder in them, then connects them between two compartments securely by a pig's bladder.
The moisture is heated slightly over the fire and then enters through the injection end into the gallbladder, gripping your hand on the gallbladder firmly with the moisture until you feel that the illness has sensed that the moisture has reached the gallbladder.
If you are not prepared, take a round piece of pith made from it and hollowed out completely on all sides, insert a tight cord into that hole as if turning it then gather the circle like closing a lid after placing in what you want of moistures, drops, or water.
Then secure it on the instrument and make something as you made from a bladder by hand until moisture reaches the bladaderubber's end, and fill with blood (from the patient). Cut small holes in its ends to allow air to escape while filling; tie off one end.
Chapter Sixty-two.
In the output of the scalpel.
We have mentioned that in the section on cutting different types of haemorrhoids and their treatment with medication, as well as distinguishing between those originating from the kidneys and those from the bladder along with their corresponding signs; we also discussed when to operate manually or by incision.
Those originating in the bladder are specific, and those developing at the urethra; I have described them with an explanation and summary.
I say that haemorrhoids originating in the bladder are more common among young people, and one of its signs is that urine exits from the bladder resembling water in appearance.
It shows sand and is described as causing discomfort, often it descends further, spreading and protruding with it the rectum in many cases; it facilitangs boys to conceal their occurrence until they reach fourteen years old but becomes more problematic in adulthood while for youngsters it falls somewhere in between.
The one whose size is greater has an easier treatment, and the smaller one is more difficult in comparison; if we proceed with the treatment by injecting the afflicted with a needle that expels all the pus within it, this may prevent the presence of abscesses upon examination.
Then the afflicted is lifted by their legs and lowered to let the abscess drain into the urethra or raised multiple times, then seated between your hands supported with feet hanging under their thighs so that all the bladder faces downwards, followed by examination.
If one feels the abscess in the surrounding area, then inform your supervisor immediately and do not attempt to squeeze it; if the patient is a boy or middle finger, use the left hand greased with oil to wipe the fingernails.
If a completely uncircumcised boy enters, examine the abscess until it slightly moves toward the urethral opening with your finger and then press on it, pushing it outwards towards the desired location for drainage.
The headmaster commanded one servant to squeeze the bladder with his right hand and another to stretch a female'cups' above her using her left hand, while extending the skin beneath them from the position where there is a hole, then the smooth instrument depicted this.
It is made by making a hole between the male and female (figures) on the left side, not in the middle, with the slit being on the same level as your finger at the seat, squeezing it outwards to make the opening wide from outside and narrow inside to its widest possible extent.
The largest finger at the seat of the slit, when squeezed outward, may exit without difficulty, but be aware that it might have angles and letters making its exit difficult.
Of them, there are ones shaped like walnurtures and easier to exit from the slit; if it had angles or letters increasing its difficulty to come out, then it should not be forced but rather caught by a tight fist with one side resembling a hatchet.
Adjust the leg to prevent it from slipping and if something enters undernecuff, do not widen the gap too much but cut out a sliver of blood instead.
If there were more than one large stone, first push the largest into the ureter and then widen it, afterwards pushing in the smaller ones as well; do likewise if there are greater than two, for they are very large so he must create a large incision since this exposes to disease.
Either they die or urinary incontinence always occurs to avoid blockage but try pushing it out until expelled, or convert into full closure with clips until it is released.
If your wound heals but does not close, and tightens up again with a crack covered in oil or wine or rosewater and cold water to cool down the inflamed tumor then the patient dries out on his bed without the stitches dissolving by the third day.
If the stitches of the incision come out with much water and oil then treat it with aloeswood ointment and sulphur paste until healed, as presenting a wound and an inflamed tumor indicating that blood has clotted in the bladera)nd urine retention.
Enter your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it may cause uterine putrefaction or infection, so then wash the ward with vinegar, water, and salt; whatever form of treatment is available to make it heal.
During treatment, it is necessary to tie and gather the thighs to ensure that the medication placed in position remains; a small pad was inserted into the canal and protruded from it, preventing urine leakage as described by me before the fissure occurs.
Often I depended on this treatment for the fissure, tried it and took iron filings as shown in this image:.
The triangle tip is pierced into the canal, then a string is tied and fastened to the shaft below the pad so that it does not return to the uterus; then iron filings are entered through the incision with care until they reach the same pad.
The iron filings are held by your hand in the same pad a little bit, and you enlarge its hole until it is pushed from the opposite side; then urine flows at the time of his release, so clamping your hand on what remains of the pad from outside the shaft causes it to shrink and exit with the uramra, curing the condition.
However, if this treatment does not prepare you to overcome the obstacles preventing you from doing so, tie a rope undernecups and another rope above the cups, then scrape on the cups at the same peg between the two knots and then extract it.
Then loosen the knots and cleanse the clotted blood that formed in the wound, but one must tie the rope under the cups so that it does not return to the bladder and another rope over the cups so that if the rope is untied after removing the cups, the skin returns to its place covering the wound.
Therefore, it is required that the upper rope raises the skin to its place and covers the wound as we said.
The surgical and orthopedic section.
In the case of uterine curettage for women.
When a few uterine cups are born in women, if one of them presents the cup, he may find it difficult to treat and many faces oppose its treatment because she may be pregnant or another woman does not allow herself to be treated by a doctor.
If a virgin or woman with incontinence is the case and you cannot find a woman to improve this craft, especially manual work, then for women the location of the hole on the cup is different from the position of the cup and requires a deeper cut.
"In such a case, necessity requires that a woman surgeon be sought out and if not found, ask for a pious physician or male assistant to summon a capable woman in the field of women's affairs or a female informant knowledgeable in this craft.
"She is instructed to prepare all that she has been commanded concerning the examination of the hymen or even so, if the woman is a virgin, it should be entered into her vagina and inspecting the h[e]nus then squeezing it with her finger.
"Then she is commanded to open up, if not a virgin and covered, instructs the eligible one to enter her finger into the vagina and inspect the hymen afterwards, placing her left hand on the vulva and squeezing firmly.
"If found, it is fitting to draw her finger down from the vulva towards the base of strength as far as to reach the origin of the labia then scratching at its halfway point near the origin of the labia from whichever side appears most suitable and feeling for the hymen in that area.
Her finger does not bypass the joint under pressure, and let there be a small gap first then allow the pus to enter that small gap so that she feels the joint in the gap as much as you know that the bone is coming out of it, and know that there are many types of fractures.
From them, small and large, flat and pointed, with hooks and spirals; know their types so that you can deduce what you want from it. When blood bursts at the joint gap, grasp it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the bone is extracted, work with the tools you mentioned for extracting bones from men to use in your own work; when blood bursts and bleeding occurs, know by the pulse of the blood that it comes from a severed vein at the location.
Wrap it tightly with a clean gauze and leave it; do not disturb or remove the dressing, let the bone remain until the inflammation is gone, then treat the wound if there has been bleeding for days and the area becomes less painful before returning to your work until the bebone comes out.
Chapter Two and Sixty-Two.
In the groove on the water device.
The water device is nothing but a collection of moisture in the white lining that is under the eggshell and called saffan, which may be within its own special envelope prepared naturally on one side of the egg.
Until he thinks that it is another egg and between the shell membrane and the white which we said earlier, but not except in the bending point; this device generates from weakness when presented to women who have childbirth contractions with this material and may present a slap on women.
This moisture has many colors either it is the color of yellow or it may be bloody red, or it may be black blisters or white watery and more than that it may have marks known by them.
Where the meeting of water is, it's if in the white membrane we said earlier is a small round shape like an egg and does not show pores because moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If the humidity is within a certain area, then the tumor will be spherical in relation to the egg.
For this, man anticipates that it is another egg, and if the humidabit lies between the corpse's skin and a white napkin then it falls under touching, as for knowing the color of the moisture, measure the tumor by using the square plate through which its image was presented, what appeared outside came to be judged by that within.
If we proceed with the treatment by iron, it is appropriate to sentence the patient for recovery if possible and I saw that his body was full then he recoiled onto his back on something high a little and placed underneath many tears then you sit on his left side.
And the steward commands him to sit on his right side extending his arm to one of the sides of the corpse's skin and towards the direction of the navel then take an open scalpel and shave the skin from the middle to close to the scarification.
And the incision is straight in line with the division of the skin's flesh to two halves until it reaches the white napkin that covers it, then extract without shaving and keep your slough as close to where you have attached more with the egg and inspect the sloughing to the extent possible.
Then the suturing bag filled with water is wide-mouthed and all the water is drained out, then you create a gap between the edges using forceps and extend the suturing bag to top without touching the shell's skin inside and cut the suture as much as possible either by pulling it through or making multiple cuts.
Especially the thinner side, if you do not cut it properly and ensure that water does not return, a blister will appear on its skin while working; when removing sutures, gather the edges of the skin together using thread.
Then treat it with the standard surgical treatment until cured, and if a blister has become infected due to another illness, connect the affected vessels in the affected area to prevent bleeding; then cut the sutures from the wound and remove the blister before treating it as previously mentioned.
The collected water in both sides indicates that each one caused the opposite side to separate as much as was done on the first, whether you deem it a single act or not; then cleanse the blood.
In the cuts, introduce cotton soaked in oil or rose water until it emerges from outside another piece of cotton that has been submerged in wine and oil; then smooth out on both sides of the skin, near the navel area, and place over a tightly wrapped incision. He connects it from above with the cord that has six edges on this image:.
Then, two incisions are made using the forceps shown here and the flap is stretched with cotton or damp wool wrapped around it, forming the edges to be stitched from silk thread and one of the edges is attached on the thigh.
The second one is taken towards the edge and two on each calf from below, while the other two edges are at the knees, gathering the tension all in silk thread, this device can also be made of wood instead of iron.
It is that the circumcision scissors should be used to cut through the skin and a bandage as described until the white foreskin covering the leg swells with water, another device shown on this image:.
It resembles the Greek eye, then it is tied with that foreskin and a bandage until all moisture comes out of them, then the prepuce is stretched with pliers and pulled through the cylinder, lifting the layer containing fluid and cutting as much as possible to reach all of it without burning anything white.
Know that this work calmed and moved away from bleeding, and is better than working with incisions; if you encounter a bile duct or gall bladeroÃ¹, or choleric swelling, or bleeding, or any other thing that needs to be addressed, treat it as appropriate according to the healing method suitable for each.
The illness was jaundice and did not improve with this procedure due to the obstinacy of its nature, so try another method as we have described if it is suitable for you from what we provided from indications.
The apparatus is aquatic and it should be positioned on a high chair with the tumor hanging below by an extended arm, make the tube run along the body to have a wide opening and ensure all water flows out before placing in the designated spot.
Leave it to expel the remaining water then treat until the wound heals, for if you remove the tube during its use and only remains because the white envelope obstructs in the mouth of the wound preventing the exit of water.
Then it should be inserted into the wound with an ivory stick or the device that extracts water as presented by its image, or slightly open the wound.
Know that the water has collected and coagulated after six months or so, if it gathered in its own dish and defends the patient for days on end.
Chapter Three and Sixty.
In the crack on the meat device and its treatment.
Know that the crack on this device from the flesh is brought to death in most cases, therefore we see it left and safe from it, and remembering working therein and types of tumors.
I say that many tumors have occurred in bodies where the composition is female, and this happens for several reasons: either due to a predisposition towards females or by hitting it so that there is no moisture found within it. And its color matches the body's color.
The tumor is hard and perhaps the tumor was calcified in coloration, without any sensation to it, and may be from tangle of vessels or swelling as described by Zeus, or from a burst of glands similar to grape swelling; when knowing that enlargement of vessels was understood to mean diffusion of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, and nothing should be revealed from pressure; but that which is a swelling of grapes does not diffuse by pressing with the fingers, this type may crack on it as well as adjacent meats.
It is that you scrape the skin of the dead, then extend it upwards and take it out from the white sack, relieve the vessel and join the vessels, cut the ligament after having released it on all sides from the eggshells, so that the egg was cooked with those detached meats.
It was necessary for the egg to be taken out and cut, if there were adhesions between something of sacks or vessels all such adhesions should have been released and cut into circular pieces.
It was the meat of the adhesion where it is stuck from behind that should have been cut and removed, as we said; if you did your surgery with a fluffy wool cloth soaked in rose oil and vinegurt then treat it with all therapies until healed.
The Fourth Chapter and Sixty-Second.
In the treatment of the instrument with a dialysis.
The dialysis was a twisted band of gauze, similar to strings, used for women's relaxation and difficulty with the patient having activity disorder, sports, walking, and in treatment of this case of weakness nearer than what is provided by male counterparts.
However, one should remember that this procedure follows what the ancients did. So I say it is proper for the patient to sit on a raised chair and then push down the straps of women's undergarments, then grasp the skin near the pole with your fingers along with the vessel close by.
He grasps it with his own hands and stretches it severely, then makes a wide cut that runs parallel to the blood vessel's bandage until the vessels are loosened, as I mentioned in Chapter on Vessels located in the Eyelids, and then inserts a threaded needle into it.
It is connected at the first spots where its function has shown, and also in the last ones; then it is cut longitudinamo, cutting a slit in the middle along the body, and excreting anything that has accumulated within the solidified secretions.
Then treat the varicose vein with a treatment as desired by most surgeons to cause blood loss, so that the function is shown in all vessels for one of the women without harm, it is necessary for one of the women to lose blood along with the vessels. Before cutting the vessel, it swells and does not contract with it.
Chapter Five to Six.
In the treatment of aneurysms.
These aneurysms arise from a shunt presenting in the extended abdominus towards the pelvis, draining into one of the venous channels connected to that tear.
This tear occurs either from the rupture of a shunt or its extension; these two causes often result from a blow, electrocution, loud noise, lifting heavy objects, etc., and such symptoms may occur occasionally over an extended period.
The swelling does not occur suddenly; the tumor remains consistent in depth prior to the seal of the shunt, and its symptoms indicate if it occurs from a ruptureâsevere pain onset with visible changes under the skin near the site.
This involves the exit of the shunt and its fate towards outside the fossa, possibly escaping with pus or discharge that may emit an odor; there might be a surgical procedure for draining such accumulation, wherein one could find signs of an underlying disease causing deterioration.
Because it causes a severe pain and rumbling, especially when coughing, the treatment of this type of abscess is dangerous and should be avoided, and the procedure requires that the patient inserts their hand into the cavity to push back the contents.
Then he lifts his head between your hands and raises his legs, stretching the skin from neck to bottom and scratches off all fat like a plow until tears come out of the furrow. Then he inserts spices into the crevice as needed to open it up.
The furrow will be as deep as the egg can be extracted from it, then you drain all secretions undernecued skin until a firm white membrane is revealed on all sides; then insert your fingertips into what remains of the egg.
Between the white membrane undernecued skin and between the second furrow, it releases adhesion from behind the egg; then bend your right hand towards within the cuirass and while doing this stretch the white membrane to top with your left hand and lift the egg along with the second furrough up.
The steward ordered the egg to be cracked open and released completely, then examined with your finger to ensure there was no remaining shell fragment in the hard white part; if so, something must be pushed into the abdesteem.
Then she takes a needle with a thick thread that has been tied with ten strands and inserts it at the far end of the incision under the skin flap; then she cuts off both ends of the string, leaving four strands. Then she ties one to the other firmly and secures the flap under the skin of the anus with a tight knot on both sides; also tie off the ends of the strings with a very strong knot so that nothing in the vessel can reach it. Thus, it would show a red swelling and form another tie outside the first one at least two fingers away from it; after these two ties she lifts up the skin flap of the anus to the level of the bone of the thumb.
Thus, it would show a red swelling and form another tie outside the first one at least two fingers away from it; after these two ties she lifts up the skin flap of the anus to the level of the bone of the thumb. She then cuts the remaining part off at an angle and removes it with a syringe, drawing out blood as described in what follows; then she uses mashed cotton soaked in oil and places it on the wound, using the ties we have mentioned.
The white cloth that we mentioned after cutting it must be carefully handled to avoid excessive bleeding, and the bandage should remain until it falls off by itself; if it is slow to fall, immerse it in hot water and hold it there until it stains with moisture.
Then treat the wound using all surgical methods until it heals.
Chapter Six and Seven.
In this respiratory device, I have not seen anyone proudly treated with iron therapy; the ancients mentioned that they would make what we described in the apparatus where a valve is connected after puncturing it gently downwards to connect the vessels.
Then make an incision in the middle and treat the tumor until the vessels burst, and treat the ward as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Seven and Eight.
At the incision that is in the ear.
The incision in the ear may present as we mentioned its position and does not descend to women, but if it descends, it will do so gradually and return at all times.
However, if time passes and the incision in the scrotum extends until it descends to the thighs, this would be an extension of the scrotal slit that is in the ear as we mentioned. That is, it extends the caruncle and then relaxes its position and contracts, and it is treated with the same as has been described.
It is treated with iron, whereby the disease is stretched out on its back between your hands; then prick a weak spot that arises to make an incision along the width equal to three fingers and tie the caruncles under the skin.
Until the white caruncle that follows takes off its exudate, place it on the freshest spot of the caruncle and press down to the depths of the abdomen; then twist the two spots around the sides of the exudate from the caruncle and sew them with a needle.
Then soak the edge of the exudate, do not cut off the caruncle, nor touch the egg white or anything else as I have taught you in treating a trapped arrow and then treat it with surgical treatment.
If the threads break and the wound heals, then the caruncle contracts and does not increase in size.
This is best at this place because it is closest to safety.
Chapter Eight and Sixteen.
In relaxation, skin from the armpit.
Frequently, skin from the armpit relaxes in some people not because of meats inside it and its appearance changes; therefore, one who wishes to treat it should let the patient sleep on their back.
Cut all the skin that has relaxed on thick skin and gather the edges, then if you wish to sew first a little bit of the relaxed skin with three or four stitches and record from the suture line; then cut between the stitches.
Then, treat it with a topical treatment for the surgeon to heal and let the stitches fall off.
The ninth and twelfth section.
In occlusion.
Occlusion in our custom is forbidden.
And thus, it was necessary for me not to mention this in my book and only mentioned twice: one to inform the physician if asked about it and how to treat an infected wound; and another that we often need to use occlusion on some animals for our benefit.
Regarding donkeys, dogs and cats or similar animals, I say that occlusion is effective in two ways: either by consent or forceful means. For the former, our method involves making the animal sit in hot water until their female parts relax, enlarge, and fall off.
Then hold it in your hand until it loosens and becomes apparent upon touch, and as for the closure of a wound or incision, it is to be held by the animal with its left paw while grasping the skin around it, then the stitches are tied and each cut is opened up one at a very time.
Until the two eggs hatch, cut them off after they have eaten and leave no remnants of the thin membrane that is on the vessel, this method of closure is better than the one that is with satisfaction.
Because satisfaction may have persisted in the females, then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter seventy.
Treatment of castration.
Castration in men is of two types, one that appears on the body as it does among females and has the form of a woman's penis with hair and secretion from the prepuce.
And as for women, there is one type and it appears above the vagina like small male nipples with secretion coming out of them as if they are a man' cups, and treatment of the three types.
Two types of men and one type of women should have the excessive meats removed until it is relieved, then treat with a general surgical remedy until healed; as for the second type of men from whom urine leaks into their perineum without being associated with an enema or fecal matter.
The section on surgeons and seventy [procedures].
Cutting the bone and extracting meat from women's private parts.
The bone may naturally increase to the extent that it distorts its appearance and swells in some women, spreading like men until reaching climax and ejaculation.
It is proper for the bone to be held by your hand or a catheter, and cut it without pushing into the incision, especially not deep in the root so as not to expose bleeding blood vessels.
Then treat with surgical remeder to heal, and as for the protruding flesh it is a meat that grows in the vagina until filled.
And perhaps exits outside like an anal example. Thus some early physicians name the anus disease as such, it is advisable to cut it like bone and treat until healed.
Chapter Two Hundred Seventy-Six.
In the treatment of hernias.
A hernia is when the woman's vaginal opening is not sealed or the hole is small, and it may be naturally occurr cued by birth or artificially caused, the latter often due to excessive straining.
Or a thin or thick one, located either in the depth of the vagina or on its sides, or above or below it; it prevents sexual intercourse and menstruation, and is detectable depending on accessibility.
If the seal appears to be visible, but isn't when checked with fingers or a speculum, then it is a thin membrane close to the labia majora; if torn, lubricate and insert two fingers fully before placing index fingers entirely.
The woman stands with legs apart, spreads the labia widely until the thin membrane is ruptured and the seal opens; she then takes wool, dips it in oil, places it on the site, and gathers herself daily to prevent resealing of the area.
It was a thick and dense abscess that needed to be lanced with a broad instrument resembling paper, the plug being made of goat's udder attached by needles and cut off so as to serve as an agent that blocks bleeding from non-coagulating sources such as quinces and chestnps and cheese.
Then a wide iron tube is used to irrigate the wound quickly, holding it by threads and using a candle made of animal fat, and all types of treatment for inflammation are applied until healing occurs; on the belly, another meat product should be cut in this manner.
If it is not a malignant tumor, then the cancerous tumor in the abdard does not present with iron casting.
The third chapter and seventy-sixth passage.
In treating hernias, varicose veins, and red protrusions that occur in the female genital area.
Regarding hernias, it is an abdominal bulge up to where blood leaks continuously if varicose veins occur; the types and signs of them were mentioned in the division and we will now mention these.
"What can be treated and what cannot, I say that cysts and abscesses if they are in the depth of the chest and do not show to touch, there is no treatment with iron wire, and whatever was from it within the mouth of the chasto (throat) touched it.
"It was necessary for the woman to enter a warm room, then extend the abscess with a probe or a coarse scalpel and cut it from its roots, then crush it when blood oozes from one of the stopping points.
"Like the bull and the sheep, etc., then raised her legs against the wall for an hour, then immersed them in cold water; if bleeding continues, she sat in pomegamill soup with quail eggs and almonds, etc., then took powdered barley and kneaded it with honey and vinegar.
"Bind it to her back and the hard mass that protrudes from without consent, then take a sponge soaked in trifolium sap or fennel syrup or elm bark juice with almond milk extract.
If the tumor resides, treat the location with compresses until it clears up, and as for the red pustule, which is similar to rough spines of an animal's back viewed from a distance, it should be cut off as much as appears on top according to what was mentioned in Theatrum. Treat it until it heals.
Chapter Four and Seventy.
In the pus that exudes in the groin.
There are many types of tumors that may appear in the groin, such as cancer, encapsulated tumor, ulcers, abscesses, tubercles, hernias, boils, fissures, thorns, and hot nodules. All these diseases and their varieties have been mentioned along with their signs.
In this chapter, it is important to mention the hot tumor that appears in the groin if it originates from a type of tumor whose base resembles iron filings; one should expect severe pain with twitching and inflammation as initial symptoms.
I saw it as red and if the patient feels pain, do not rush to compress or treat until these symptoms settle; then it is advised that the woman sits on a chair with back support.
Her legs are gathered to the lower part of the abdamen, her thighs are spread apart and her arms lie underneath her knees and they are joined by straps that have been adjusted.
So then the woman who is suitable sits on the right side and uses the device that opens with her vaginal opening, which she has brought forth in subsequent imagery; it should be such that if this device is used, it takes into account a deeper depth of the woman's vagina so that more than the depth of the vagina enters through the device.
In the case of a disease, it was found that the device should be placed higher on the lip of the vaginal opening to prevent the entire device from entering into the depth of the vagina and so that the sleeve which is inserted in the device comes from the upper side.
You hold the device and manage the sleeve until the vaginal opening opens, if the discharge appears and touches your hand and it is soft and fine then you should scrape it at its head with a wide spatula once the entire tube has emptied.
It was necessary that the wound be covered with a thin film soaked in rose oil or green ointment and to make sure the tape is on the outside of the incision at the vaginal opening and it should come out from beyond onto the skin around the genital area, with clean cotton soaked in boiled water that has been mixed with wheat germ.
Then treat it with the bandage that heals it, until it is cured.
And he washes the wound and stitches it with water, honey, then with boiled spring or pine resin water before returning to bandaging; the drainage has been constantly internal within the abdamoen.
It was necessary to refrain from treating it with iron but rather as we mentioned in the section on division.
The Fifth and Seventieth Section.
In the teaching of spices, on how to treat patients if they excrete abnormally.
The spice must first know the natural form of childbirth through its signs if a woman sees descending to below and longing to expel air and losing her contents.
And know that the childbirth is natural if there are signs of it descending to below and carrying with its umbilical cord, then you should press her belly for how quickly the baby is born.
If it descends to above and cleanses from the curiosity, then this birth is not natural but permissible as a baby comes out on its legs before its head and hands.
With one hand or a man's head, or the exiting of hands or the exiting of fists inwardly; perhaps it turned to its feet and something like that from evil forms. It was necessary for them to be skillful and gentle with all these things and to avoid slip-ups and errors.
I detail every form of it and how to navigate through them so that you can deduce from that and stand firm, if the child comes out on its head in a natural exit and intensifies towards the woman for that and her delivery becomes difficult and I saw that her strength has weakened and she sat down on a chair and women were ordered to adjust it.
And he soothed her with a cooked hellebore and moistened sponges, then the attendant inserted a small instrument between her fingers to push out the fetus or use her thigh until it expelled any fluids and pressed the woman's abdnentil.
If it did not come down, then the woman should inhale a hellebore draugeb extract with lubricating oil after being ordered to shake and urinate into the bedpan, clenching her mouth and nose, then the fetus will exit from its hourglass shape; firstly its hands should be gently pulled out.
Indeed, the woman did not enter through the outlet; she raised her legs onto a platform and then shook it to the ground while holding onto a rope that was attached to it. When this happened, the hands did not enter, only the fetus died so they cut off its body parts and pulled out what remained of the fetn.
Or he tied his hands with a rope and pulled them up, so that it came out; the fetus exited on its legs, if the fetus exited on its legs then you should push them up until they are slightly tilted, cover them briefly, and then one of the legs is gently stretched.
If they came out onto the thighs, she was commanded to shake and spray with lemon juice; it comes out, but not as we described, except for one fetus which is slightly tilted until it assumes its natural shape, then it exits gently, so do not deviate from what we described.
A mixture of lemon drops and breast milk, almond oil and melted soap is beaten well together, then poured into the woman's vagina with good strokes, followed by pouring it down her belly and sitting in a fur bath until the contractions stop.
If you see that he has fallen down, make a clay pipe from mud and have him hold it in his mouth; then sit him on the chair, let him spit into it, plug his nose and mouth, and gently squeeze his lower abdomen; then the fetus will come out after an hour, leaving the baby exiting his thighs and hands.
If the baby is born this way, take his hands and pull them gently; then lift the woman onto her feet, let her slide down to the ground, place her on a bed, and hold her arms; then lightly press over her abdomen. Then remove everything under her legs, the placenta, until she is fully expelled; if not all of it comes out with her feet, pull them vigorively and press slightly over the vulva to help the fetus ascend above, then gently enter your hand and guide the fetus a little bit.
Order the woman to dance until the fetus is born; if the baby comes out slightly pressed against one of her hands, grasp it with his hand; but if she can't respond or walk afterward, make her sit down.
Her bed shook her legs violently, then she used the lubricant described as spermicide so that when it was released he sat on a chair and treated in response with his hand and arranged the fetus back to its natural form and urged the woman to dance until she left.
The child was removed from his hands, facing the mother's chest, and it should be held by its eligible hand then gently turned until it is ready as described with fat and spermicide.
Then she is made to move slightly, if so she sat on the chair and urged her towards the right side then dance until he was expelled with a cone, the child exited perpendicularly.
If it falls on the nipple with milk, use your foot to extract the milk until it is dried out and then suspend the child's head and neck so that its umbilical cord is cut cleanly without bleeding then push the fetus in completely until he settles as should be.
The order for the woman is to squat multiple times, as she will have an easy childbirth or a large separation of twins. Be aware that often twins are born and they can be three or four; otherwise, only in rarity do they survive, while five births at once are something beyond nature and they never live.
They are surrounded, each with their own membrane and separated by a clear barrier attached to each of them; one may exit naturally and easily like a single childbirth, as we described before.
Their difficulty in childbirth has turned into the forms we mentioned as abnormal, and be gentle so that you can do what you need to do easily, willingly, and adapt to any form it makes sense for her to use a method leading to safety, as described before.
He mentioned being imagined in the womb by a woman who is miscarrying; it may be one, two, three, four, five, six, more than ten at once and has been verified that a woman had fallen with seven and another fifteen all of them preformed (in her mind).
"The appreciation of the esteemed learned, all this should be in knowledge suitable for when it encounerters such a day as one ought to approach.
Chapter Six Hundred and Seventy-Four.
In the output of a deceased fetus.
If a deceased fetus as mentioned in the section is treated, if it does not exit and forces the matter to work with hands then it was appropriate that the woman had sufficient strength and did not have any of those symptoms that one fears harm from them. The woman should be lifted onto a bed placed on her back.
Her head should be tilted downwards, her legs raised and supported from both sides or attached to the bed so that her body does not gravitate towards the fetus at the time of its delivery.
Then, wet her nipples with moistened pads, milk extractor and papillae of the teat, then she should lubricate herself using these materials and gently insert them into her womb, followed by a place for the expulsion of fluids from the fetus, where positions are agreed upon.

It may contain typographical errors or incomplete segments of text. Please ensure that the correct and complete Arabic text is provided for accurate translation into English.
Note: This excerpt is also in Arabic and seems to be referring to a procedure involving the insertion of arrow shafts (ØµÙÙØ§Ø±Ø©) into specific parts of the body, possibly as part of medical treatment or anatomical study. However, without proper context or reference to Albucasis's textbook on surgery, it is challenging to provide a translation that accuramoors with known historical texts. It may be prudent to verify the authenticity and accuracy of this excerpt before proceeding with translation.
Note: This Arabic excerpt seems to describe a process where multiple arrow shafts are inserted into the body until no more can be accommodated, ensuring even distribution throughout all directions without bias toward any one direction and with equal spacing between them. However, as this is a fragment of text lacking context or reference to specific practices in Albucasis's work, verifying its authenticity and historical accuracy would be advisable before attempting translation.
Note: This excerpt appears to describe a procedure involving the removal of an object (possibly a tumor or foreign body) from the jaw, suggesting that it should be done with care similar to extracting teeth, and ensuring minimal disturbance in the surrounding area. The text then advises greasing some fingers with oil for lubrication during the process and guiding them to manage the extraction carefully. However, without further context or confirmation of its alignment with Albucasis's medical treatments as detailed in his surgical texts, translation accuracy may be compromised. Verification against authoritative sources is recommended before proceeding with a translation attempt.
He slightly raised it and did this until the entire fetus was expelled; her hand came out before the rest, and she could not be pulled back due to the tension so it was necessary to tear a hole in her and then pull her through completely after all had been expelled.
Either in the palm or the pinky finger, so it should be done with the other hand and both feet; since the baby's head was large and exerted pressure during delivery, or there was fluid in its head, it was necessary to insert a pointed stick between the fingers.
And the head was pierced to allow the water to be expelled or shaken out using the tool called the forceps, which is depicted with images of other tools in the door next to this one.
Similarly, if the fetus had a large head, it should be lanced or extracted with forceps as we mentioned before, and then all the bones are expelled; when the head is squeezed during contractions, it should tear to release the moisture in the chest.
In that case, if the chest does not join and nothing comes out for exiting, it should be cut to an extent you can; there was pain in the lower abdomen or a boil on it, so it was necessary to tear until moisture drained from it.
Indeed, when the fetus was on his thighs, it was easy to draw it toward the womb with a cord that had been wrapped around your hand and inserted into his abdard or chest until he expelled what was inside them.
Indeed, the entire body was taken out and the head reemerged. When his left hand was found to be accessible, the mouth of the womb was open so that her hand entered into its neck and pulled on the head with it, then drew it towards the mouth with her fingers; afterwards, she inserted a syringe or two syringes and drew them with it.
Indeed, the mouth of the womb had formed a red swelling that should not be irritated but rather treated by using moistened solid items and wraps and sitting in water that has been allowed to settle and humidify.
And if the fetus was on its side, then it might be possible to do what we mentioned for an intact fetal case; however, if that is not feasabÙe, cut and remove a piece, and ensure no tissue remains inside the placenta; should your treatment fail, then apply what we've discussed regarding treatment for hot tumors presenting in the womb.
In the case of blood leakage, it descends into a constricting vessel and uses the upper treatment, and I have seen a woman who had tied off an embryo in her womb then re-tied it again.
Then the other embryo also showed symptoms to her after a long time, swelling occurred in what covered it and it expanded until it burst, allowing pus from its cavity to be drawn out for treatment. She treated it over a long period of time; she did not allow the wound to heal using some strong attracting bandages.
He moved from the first position, and then another bone emerged in her for days; when that happened again, her belly had a place without any bones, she realized it was due to dead embryo bones. She searched the wound and came out with many bones of the baby's head.
I did not cease until many bones emerged, and the woman was in her best condition, living like this for a prolonged period; pus kept flowing from it, and now we are here with this rare case.
Because there is knowledge and compassion as the physician tries to achieve treatment with his hand.
Chapter Seventy and Seventeen.
In it are images of the tools that he needs during childbirth extraction.
Image of a loup with an opening for the womb.
This clamp used by the books, whether with two loupps on both ends, but this loup should be softer than a clamp and it should be made of boxwood or ashwood and each plank's width at finger-span.
And their hooks toward the finger and length of them a span, half a span in between the two planks made from the same wood species they may have fastened on it with lengths up to a span or slightly more and widths towards fingers or slightly more.
They are the ones that enter into the womb to open with them during your management of the two loupps, image of another tool for similar softness and delicateness.
It is made of boxwood or ashwood in the shape of grips, except that it has on both ends projecting pieces as you see each piece's length towards a span and widths towards fingers if you want to open the womb with them.
She sat on a bed with her legs spread apart, then she inserted the two instruments into the vagina and held one of them at the bottom between her thighs, then you opened your hand with the instrument as if opening the labia to the desired degree. Until you create the opening as desired, a figure of Leupold mentioned by the ancients.
The image depicting the device that expels the fetus.
An illustration of the forceps used to extract the baby's head.
The scissors resemble having teeth at the ends as you see, and it seems to create a rectangle like labia with this image where it has incisors that cut through just as they do with saws.
An additional illustration of a forceps device.
A depiction of a catheter.
This catheter has a slightly thinner edge so that it does not break when pulled towards the fetus, an image of a catheter with two prongs.
An illustration of wide forceps for cutting the fetus.
These tools, all of which were numerous types and allowed the operator to work faster, raised awe among people due to their effectiveness; no device can match these instruments for there was never any need for them where they are not essential.
Chapter Eighty-Seven.
In the discharge of phlegm.
Then it is necessary to suture the wound so that it seals itself, and spit with a stick into it and press your fingers on its mouth and constrict its orifices. If this happens, then you may remove some amount of dressing.
Make a hole in the dressing and place opened herbs such as fennel, sage, chicory, poppy, chamomile, aloe, or cumin in it; all these herbs are optional. Soak them in water and heat over fire then place a silver tube on the wound hole of the dressing and the other end in the vagina.
It will adhere until the steam reaches the vaginal cavity, and then it should spit as we said, so that the herbal mixture exits quickly; if this treatment persists, and nothing is discharged, one may instruct to dip his left hand in oil or eyelashes.
Then she should insert it into the vagina and inspect with it if any swelling or protrusion is present, slightly pulling it out until it exits; if it was attached in depth of the vagina, one should enter his hand as we instructed until he feels some attraction on the tentacle.
Unless the uterus falls during intense attraction, it should be gently moved to the left and right sides, then its pulling force increases; at this point, it responds and breaks free from adhesions. Thus, we have described treatment with rolling, traction therapy, and herbs.
However, it did not exit as we described; instead of punishing her for that failure to attract again and should be attached to the uterus along the woman's thigh then smeared with a quadruple ointment which soaks into it after days.
And it is relieved and exits only if it has soaked, emitting an unpleasant smell to the abdamen and head, in which case one should use consenting smoke (tobacco).
So some have tried smoking with tobacco and dried grapes, an apparatus from which the woman emits during menstrual arrest and vaginal bleeding:. (Note: This is a continuation of the Arabic text and does not directly translate into English; it appears to be referring back to previous content.)
An instrument made of lead-like material or one made from a needle, inserting the tip into the vagina and widening it; heating on fire and inhaled over hot coals will cause them to cling until they pass away, then return again: (Note: This appears to describe another method for treating menstrual issues using metal instruments or smoke therapy. It seems incomplete and potentially a part of historical medical practices.)
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
In the Treatment of Non-Surgically Placed Piles.
Many boys may produce and have non-surgically placed piles, the thin saffron should be applied to allow it to be pierced by its finger; otherwise, securely fasten with a sharp instrument and caution against touching the muscle.
Then place it with a damp cloth in the wine and oil, then treat with leeches until he recovers; beware that piles may block the opening of a glass tube for many days, and withdraw when the child wishes to defecate.
Similarly, blockage of the pile may also result from a surgical wound or ulcer; thus, it is advised to remove the congestion and then treat as previously mentioned in healing and binding measures.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
In the Treatment of Hernias Occurring in the Lower Area.
Hernias occurring in the lower area is a complex and dense occurrence near or outside the pudendum from one of its sides, where there is one hernia or more.
If that complex becomes open and fluid seeps out from it, of a clear or clotted watery consistency; if these hernias are directed towards the fire and into the abdomen and do not become deflected, they can be recognized by what comes out during purging: gas and feces.
Sometimes the worms may exit, and if they are in space directed to the bladaster and into the shaft of a penis, or from there to the leg joint and to the anus. Also known as worms extending toward the seat (anus) by non-extension.
Enter your finger into the anus and insert a fine needle in the worm from copper or iron, if it is not in the worm then there was one inserted with a thin wire or hair of horsehair.
Until you feel with the needle or hair on your finger, if it is not a puncture and nothing comes out of the hole, nor steam nor worms as we said, then know that it is non-penetrating to treatment.
If the worm is extending to the bladaster or into the urine duct, a sign of its exit and abstaining from defecation with drugs should be observed; but if it extends to the leg joint or anus, mark the entry of the needle there.
If there is no fracture to the bone and the pain is located towards one side, with pus always coming out of it and treatment does not help, nor do poultices, all these enchanted remedies are without any effectiveness.
If it is treated futilely by those who attempt to treat her, the unenchanted and non-permanent remedangs have effectiveness as if coated with iron, according to what I described and may have tried on others. This is so that you can feel relief in your hand over its swelling.
The leg swells up and bends toward the abdomen, then enters a copper or iron nail if it is located in the thigh fracture until you realize where the nail ends; feeling as though the illness moves towards your hip socket, hence using your thumb to insert into the socket.
You feel as though the nail has been driven through your thumb, making a gap or flesh between your thumb and it; then you know for certain that it is enchanted because it does not tire if touched in this way.
They said that it cures some people in cases of shortage and the treatment is beneficial if a fine sponge is inserted into the urethra according to the size of the vessel, with the help of an instrument introduced into the vessel until it reaches near the seat, then taken out twice or thrice.
Until you know that it has been charred everywhere of the excessive meats resembling a pheasant's throat, then treat them with salt-soaked leather until they are removed and those meats that have been charred, then treat them with tight straps.
Otherwise, it does not cure without that treatment, and if the probe is inserted, do not reach your finger to the seat with a thick barrier of meat or sausage between them, and you see the vessel coming out on the surface of the skin, then the skin separates from the first vessel. You pass through the hole with the probe in it until you reach the end of the hole where the end of the probe ends and the probe slips out, then wash away those meats resembling a pheasant's throat, leaving nothing behind.
Then he treats it with violent bandages until he recovers, as the excess blood and his condition between him and his work are cut away from that meat; this is best what one can make and quickest benefit by fire or sharp drugs, because the flesh gathers two good conditions when burned.
Then he cuts the blood and dries up the moisture, then treats it with lard or powdered sulfur mixed with oil until the wound is dry and those burned meats are removed; then at that time treat the injury with violent bandages made from hardened ham.
The medicines that are absorbed and dried, if it becomes free from pain and does not cause a relapse upon returning; the serpent has reached the depth of the hip socket and after the surface of the body enters your finger into the socket and examines with it.
I felt the sting and between him and his veil or ham, it was close to exhaustion; there is little work in it but on the path of greed and hope, so use one of the three approaches as we have mentioned for wrapping it up.
If the hole is deepened until its base allows for inserting a pessary and treating near it, without stretching further so that the surrounding muscle tissue does not tear and cause an unintentional discharge of blood or fluid from the wound as described in our previous statement, then it should be treated as we have previously mentioned.
If this screen is executed and pierced after being deepened near the socket as we have stated, either with a pessary or another sharp instrument on one side, then cleanse all meats that are hanging in the incision to where they can be reached by probing.
Then fill the wound and upper cavity completely with the incision, leaving only the nasal orifice open inside the socket, which will be less visible on the illness, and this orifice may burst in such cases.
If the pessary is inserted into the nasal orifice and towards one side of the socket near the skin overlying the bony orbit, then a tapered pessader should be used like an eskaph needle on this image.
Insert a pliable string of five or so threads and then insert the pessary with the thread until its base, which will be more deeply placed in the area around the socket from within close to it.
He brought the thread out of that hole so that your finger enters the socket and bring out one end of the thread, then gather both ends together and hold them firmly for a day or two; whenever you cut the thread in the meat tighten it well until that piece of meat between the ends of the threads is dropped, then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the crocodile's mouth was not a slit that you could open, then it must be deep so do not attempt to reach for its muscles lest you cut them; make one as we mentioned until recovery and relief of symptoms.
The image of the hooked instrument with which crocodiles tear is a sharp edge and the other side not sharp so that it does not cut anything unnecessarily as you see:.
Chapter Ninety-Eight.
In hematoma from which blood oozes, cut it and treat the gap:.
The boils are either inside the socket resembling red blisters or like grapes and have both small and large ones with blood constantly oozing from them:.
There is one that is numerous and outside the anus, with its sides being those from outside the anus which are more dry than others; it should be moistened by yellow water or a small amount of constant blood, and always on a body color.
Treatment for one that is inside the anus, causing inflammation to erupt and protrude until it exits the anus and reveals a thread; accelerate its attachment with tweezers or grasp it with your fingers then cut it off upon reaching the end of it, without using tweezers to prevent moisture and relaxation.
Cut it off with a sharp incision or a piece of sterilized leather or pull it out using your fingers then cut it and sprinkle strong antiseptics on the wound so that the edges heal or apply ointment as needed for what is presented at the exit.
Then treat it with all necessary care until healed, as not allowing the anus to exit for a long time due to infection requires injecting into it to wash out what is inside and cleanse for quick excretion when the thread erupts; if the external thread away from the anus commands it then this is easy.
He should take it with forceps or suspend it with a hook and cut it, then treat it as we have mentioned until cured; those who dislike cutting with iron should use their fingers to do so for this type by inserting a tied cord into the wound.
Then pull the thread upward and insert it with a needle at its origin from the opposite side, tearing the thread's ends below the needle and leaving them attached; tighten the thread firmly then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this for all threads, but leave one that does not fray.
To extract blood clots, then apply an oil-soaked gauze on the seat and place it there with a bandage or compress; command rest for the inflammation and leave it until the threads fall off, if they do; treat them with plasters and all other treatment methods until cured.
As for the frequent treatment of fissures, they often show signs from tar accumulation and stool retention if it becomes chronic; when medication does not help, one should cleanse with a paddle or forceps until moistened and softened to allow passage.
Then treat it until it closes as it should, if it does not close immediately more severe than the first, until it heals and leaks out; then treat it, and it will recover.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
In the treatment of inverted and non-invertculed fistulas, as well as stone bile ducts and gallstones.
The fistula is indeed a swelling resembling the head of the penis, found throughout the body and particularly in the ankles and fingers, presenting with pain when walking.
It is proper to scrape around the fistula and grasp it with a knife or scalpel, then extract its root; then treat it as deemed appropriate based on what presents at its opening, while one of the hardened stones resembles a small rough nodule protruding from the body's surface.
Often, treatment of the calculus involves stretching it out and breaking or removing it with a piece of thread or hair until it falls off; then treat as necessary based on what is presented at its exit through fire or medicine.
A device that I remembered for treating the scorpion has been dismantled, both inverted and non-invertamo d ones. The scorpion itself is also a small, thick case on the body's surface going deep into it; if it were cold, one would feel as though struck by a snake's bite.
The entire body and more would be in the arm, to treat it one should take a feather from an ostrich or eagle's wing, position that tube around the scorpion until encircling its surroundings, then handle the tube with your hand until cutting around the scorpion.
The scorpion would reach the depth of muscle, and rise from its source; if one did this with a metal or bronze tube on this picture:.
The top of the tube should be tightly sealed and easily turned by fingers, if one were to bring a scorpion out using this device shown in its hole:.

Images of the devices used for injections into the anus, proctitis and colon.
A drill may be made of silver, tin, copper, or gold alloy; and these tools can be crafted for both small and large users according to the practitioner's needs. The one used in treating small boys, with narrow or bent seats and deeply drilled holes. Image of a large drill.
The one with a wide top that tightly holds the nail features a barrier where the nail is attached as seen, and the lower edge that enters into the seat is extremely tapered down to an extreme thinness on either side of two holes, and single hole on the other side.
The hole's capacity on the marrowbone or slightly thicker is such that the nail used, made from animal bladder or parchment in the form of a small boat, has a diameter of palms.
A hole drilled abundantly, as it rotates and has a length of approximately the span between each two holes is deepened, then enters into that hole with a thick twine made from about ten threads or so, which gather around the ncuh to form the boat-like structure. If the drug is placed where it clings firmly in between the two bones, and then injected with it; this is an image of a circular hole and puncture:.
How to fill the sack or bladder with the drug so that it is likely inflicted and be careful whether it is too hot or too cold then the infection rises up on its back and spills onto both legs:.
He places something underneath or a sling, then he oils the extremity of the puncture with oil, egg white, or malted milk-like substances, and gently inserts it into the socket; then he takes hold of the circular hole handle in his hands together and shakes vigorcuously until everything inside the punctured wound spills out:.
Then the punctured person exits and spills out infection onto his legs up to the wall, stimulated by the drug to exit as much as possible; if he sleeps through all night with it, it was reported that at dawn he vomited everything inside the puncture until cured:.
It has been in the socket that there are lumps or painful tumors, so the punctured should be very gently pulled away by those who perform the puncture on boys; this is an image of a gentle and tense puncture with his skin stretched tightly:.
Chapter Four and Eight.
In Surgery Treatments.
I have mentioned in the separation of treatments for something called kyat and I remember treating it with hands and medicines on completion, so I say that surgerangs differ according to what kind of surgery is being done and according to where the wound is located.
The things that involve surgery are many like stones, knives or swords and knives or spearheads or rods or arrows and similar items.
And regarding the locations according to the body, there are surgeries like head wounds or neck wounds or chest wounds or abdomen wounds or liver injuries and so on with other parts of the body.
And I describe treatments for some surgeries to make them a measure and rule for other surgerangs, and I begin with simple head surgeries because the one who wrote about it in sections three and eight of this book will come later.
I say that whenever a simple head wound occurs and it is not a skull fracture or something similar, but the skin was just scratched only, and the wound is large, fearing onset of a hot abscess, urge to excise the cyst promptly. Do not delay and remove as much blood as its strength allows, if it prevents haemorrhage; especially if the blood from the wound flows easily, to prevent further bleeding in the injured area.
Beware of excessive illness, drinks, and coarse food; preventing further bleeding involves reducing the quantity of food intake, moving closer to meat consumption, avoiding bevercups, applying a hot compress on the wound if needed, or using rose petals soaked in oil alone or with an infusion containing vinegar.
If the hot tumor is applied to the wound and blood flow remains steady without changes after a short while as described, apply some bandages if there are any modifications in breathing observed.
The swelling should extend until the patient recovers; if the wound is large and appears to be from a sword or similar weapon, without the edges meeting naturally, stitch it as I described in my surgery technique for abdominal injuries.
The skin was akin to scalp and clung tightly, except where it ran loosely; cut it then treat the wound with medicines that compel firm meat within, replace the skin, and instruct the patient to nourish on sturdy foods like bones and marrow.
Indeed, if a purulent matter occurs on the skin without adhering to the bone, cut out all of it and apply something upon it then treat it; in these surgerebans there was either an artery or blood vessel from which blood flowed out and did not stop with medication. Check the vessels.
Indeed, if it does not heal with the bandage and binding as we mentioned, try until the blood stops; these were minor simple operations that would be easy to stop by treating them so that they cease bleeding.
Before it is altered by the air, describe the ointment to take a part of milk and two parts sheep suet or fat, three parts of melted beef or lard and mix them all together well and spread on the wound as a good binding until it adheres firmly.
If it bleeds, press up with lint and leave it without washing until it is healed; the fat alone may do this if milk and suet are not added.
This action is also performed with both eyes in many major surgeries if he knows how to place it on him, tighten it, and the surgery wounds are easily closed by his blood unless air changes them; but as for if they have been changed by air, some alteration occurs, especially during summer.
In this position, the treatment is not as effective as we mentioned that it carries on its back some ripe leeches or carries a swarm of barley powder made of water and honey until cheese thickens then treat with all kinds of treatment until he recovers.
As for if the wound is a skull fracture and he is walking with swelling, it was mentioned to treat head bone fractures in what follows, in throat surgery, an injury to the neck does not differ in treatment from head fractures if they are simple.
And if a nerve from the throat has been cut or severed, then there is no way to avoid treating it with methods that tightly clamp like a pincer, strangulation, and so on because they damage the nerve and tense it.
He does not put anything cold on the wound, for the essence of nerves is cold and connected to the brain which governs all body parts, so treating it with a gentle medicine like lukewam water diluted by boiling several times or rose oil or violet oil is appropriate.
If also washed with lukewarm water and metal objects, in case the wound is large, use a needle or sew up the edges with silk thread then treat until healed.
If the wound was deep and a pus accumulated in it at its lowest part, causing an artery to break within the wound, leading to bleeding, then it should be tied off or connected or cauterized if necessary.
If the wound had torn some parts of the esophagus or all of it, then the surgeon tied up the skin edges with a needle on the esophagus tube and covered it not directly but around its natural shape then tightened it firmly and left for days.
Then he was treated with the bandage in which it clung and dried until he recovered; if the wound had affected the bone, when examined there were bone fragments to be attracted or what could be (removed) and not all that could be removed until the wound healed and healed and facilitated its discharge.
The wound was healed after we described the methods which we said would be applied to treat bone fractures; it became a successful treatment in the chest and between the shoulders, where mentioned in its chapter on thoracic surgery.
It was a cut made with a spear or knife and I saw it had bleeding, if the patient breathes out there would be wind coming from it; knowing that it is an incisive webel wound, without pus and healing by its blood, so not to make any incision at first and let it clot on its own.
He was brought to the heart after dying but made it attractive with a bandage and healed during daylight twice; if no dressing is brought, make a paste in the mouth of the wanderer to absorb what oozes out from the moisture and facilitate the patient's sleep on the wound.
Not all that is gathered in it, even if the wound has been for three days or more and no complications such as spasms, palpitations, shortness of breath, or other conditions have occurred; after observing his overall condition to be satisfactory, one can deduce that the wound is healing well with bandaging and all treatment until fully recovered.
The patient's condition is always worsening, and I believe he has become a lion to be treated from the outside; treating the chest or back wound that does not gather in it by progressing through suturing.
If the patient is large or pregnant, it may have affected the bone and a fragment of it was removed during wound exploration; if those fragments were uncontaminated, they should be removed until they are sterile. Otherwise, treat them as necessary.
If the wound heals easily, allowing for its drainage; as for surgeries in various parts of the body, their treatment is determined by what we have mentioned previously.
The Fifth and Eighty Chapter.
In abdominal surgery, exiting the wound and suturing it.
The rupture which is presented to the abdanguage may be large or small or medium; if it is large, exiting from it will be a sac or several sacks that should be inserted and sewn up more tightly and closely.
Small ruptures may also be tight from another side, and their closure should be tighter; if the sac does not appear upon its introduction to its place within an hour, it has become inflated and thickened, making insertion difficult in this case becomes better than medium rupture because it does not tighten with the return of the sac as in these two types.
Note that the two incision techniques in surgery are called "open" and belong to abdominal surgeries, while the other two specialize in external body part surgerebut are only applicable to non-abdominal surgeries.
I will explain one by one, so if the rupture is small and something from the sac exits, making its return difficult on either side (either as we mentioned or because the sac has been pre-inflated with air), this corresponds to one of the two types we discussed earlier: a small rupture or due to an inflated sac.
If that is the case, it should be warmed by immersing a sponge or cloth soaked in water only or boiled with onions, lentils, and leeks, then placed into a vessel until the swelling subsides.
The drink that contains grapes is better than water alone for relieving swelling; if you see the swelling has subsided and soaked in a vessel with boiled egg or baker's yeast, then it should be ingested by inserting into the left ear canal.
It is difficult to remove after this treatment if a slight crack has occurred with the tool that cracks using it, such as needles and pins; the first course of action should be best for cracking, but resorting to cracking may become necessary in cases of necessity or failure of tricks, here is an image of the device:.
The exposed side is limited, the other side is unlimited and the thin end is not sharp but slightly toothed like a small pincers as you see if the wound expands into the vessel so that its healing response should be in its natural form.
It was his practice if possible to do so, and as for when the tear was wide and located in the lower abdamen it should be tilted on its back with legs raised from the head and if it was in the upper abdomen then he would raise the head and chest above the pelvis.
Similarly, if the tear was on one of the sides of the abdomen, you should always make your intention and aim in surgery to elevate from the opposite side, so it is proper to operate during major surgeries and medium ones.
As for minor surgeries, place him as is possible according to you, then prepare between your hands a servant who holds the tear completely with his hands and gathers his hairs, then he reveals it to someone else for suturing afterwards.
This is the general suturing method where you take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound then leave from one end of the tear as much thread as possible and insert one needle without entering it with a thread on its edges of skin. With the instrument that is inserted under the skin from within until it is pushed through, and then the edge of the skin and the suture edges were four pieces, then tightened with a two-threaded string around the needle multiple times until all the edges of the wound met firmly.
Then leave a thickness of the fingertip as well and insert another needle then knot it with the thread as done with the first needn, until no further sutures are needed in that wound and all parts of the incision fill up and the suture is evenly positioned between the skin surface and its underside.
Because the thinner needle cuts through the flesh quickly and also makes it difficult to enter the skin, therefore it should be positioned evenly between the undersurface of the skin and its surface, and it is not advisable for the needle to penetrate close to the edge of the skin.
Otherwise, the flesh will be cut too quickly and the wound will open before healing, and suturing should not also delay so that the wound doeseclips from healing; then the needle edges will tear leading to harm to the patient while sleeping and causing a significant risk of infection with each edge attached to the needle.
She leaves it until she knows that the wound has healed, and this type of suturing with a needle is thus suitable for small surgeramoons because it may be exhausted in its sewing by one or two or so needles.
The second type of suturing in English is to bring together the skin edges with the needle on each side of the body and surrounding the lip once using a needle threaded onto a medium thickness, soft-ended string then if these four skins are done with this needle they repeat it from where it began.
The twisted string falls from the top of the wound to be sutured as per the threading technique by which the surgeon tightens it and makes between each stitch and next stitch with a slightly hardened edge of the finger, this type of sewing is known by all people.
With this type of suturing, a surgery exposure was done for a man in his abdomen who had been cut with a scalpel and the incision widened more than an inch and exited from near him towards two inches from the middle opening.
He was separated from his instrument four and twenty hours after the surgery, and in about fifteen days healed; it was treated until recovered and lived afterwards many years, behaving well in all aspects; and doctors ruled that he would not have been cured without using the tool.
It was amazing that I did not treat him with medicine, because there was nothing suitable for treatment; I put honey on the wound twice during the day and committed to washing it with honeysuckle water until he recovered.
One of the two types of special stitches is mentioned in Galen's words, which means to start stitching from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside; if the neednun punctures the skin and goes into the advancing muscle along the length of the abdard.
The edge from the side where the needle was inserted and passed through, punctured it on the other side; if it came out of the other edge from inside to outside in the other edge from the muscle tissue, then she punctured a second time in this same edge from the muscle tissue from outside to inside.
Let the incision on this side and insert the needle into its opposite counterpart from inside to outside, and execute a drainage similar to yours in the fistula until it reaches the rectum's incision line, where all of it is expelled.
Also, initiate from this side with the incision and its border corresponding to that of the fistula on the opposite side, extracting the needle through the skin nearest to it, then return it to that skin along with the edge of the fistula on the other side.
Then extract it from the skin of that side, do so again and then once more until the surgery is entirely covered like in this example, and describe this suturing as emulating the sewing technique of barber-surgeons for closing wounds.
Suturing the fistula once from one side with the skin edge and leaving it open on the other until fully drainage; also, this second type of suturing mentioned by Galeno in his words: [quote].
And it is that they should suture as instructed by medical professionals to gather all parts into a corresponding trouble spot inherently, connecting the fistula edge to its opposite and the rectum's edge to its other, just as you have described.
It is necessary to insert the needle into a nearby tissue border, and execute it within only that one and call its borders, then pull out the neednose and execute it from outside to inside in both of them and also return it back.
He performs it from inside to outside in another tissue border located on the opposite side, this double stitching is better than simple easy stitching and that which provides its introduction; these are words of Galeno, as part of his text, and some have said they may correct abdominal surgery with two needles. That is to insert one thread and start by inserting the needle from your side and executing it to the other side, then the other needle enters from the opposite side as per stitching of corsets either way.
Note that if the rupture is in the middle of the abdamint, then its stitching is harder than most parts of the belly, and what about suturing a wound is judged by its suture as common for surgeries, that is if you realize the wound is bleeding without alteration from blood flow before air changes it and inflames the cavity and sealed and controlled with ligatures.
Indeed, the wound had been altered by the hot air filled with some medicated pledgets which warmed it and caused the threads to fall out; also steaming vapors of saffron and marigold were applied before treating as usual for such surgeramoons.
Indeed, you should not have medicated the wound with hot air since I informed you to apply cold melted tin twice a day; if your surgeries are simple, there's no need for further treatment in most cases unless the wound involves vital organs and is causing pain.
It was recommended to cover the area with soothing ointment in lukewarm oil or rose-oil and apply it around the spots between the armpit and groin, as often I feel a lot of pain or pus near that region being covered by a dark, thick drink.
Especially if the pus has reached into the cavity of the wound, know that what was from the intestines was easier to heal and what came from it being thin is harder to cure.
As for the wound known as the fasting sore, it does not accept healing from surgery if there is a tumor present because of its high content of intestines and bones with membranes and close to the nature of nerves; if what protrudes from the fistula wound has burst and you recognized it as cleanly separated, then according to your pus, so be it.
He has a duration and has turned green or black, so it should be pulled out with a string from the place where it is black to avoid bleeding; in the throbings of veins and capillaries, then cut off what remains below that knot.
They make the ends of the string attached from below the surgical wound outside, making it easier to pull and remove when the throb drops and heal the wound; mentioning the wound that is exposed in the cavity, also if there was a rupture in the cavity and it was small.
He may be forced to do so because I did not see a person who had stuck in his abd([om) with a fork and the wound was on the right of the intestine, causing an abscess to form and became like a snake that exits from it and expels pus and foul-smelling gas; so I treated him as if there were no ulcer. I did not let the wound heal and close; when I saw that the place had healed, I feared something bad might happen inside him, so I did not expose it to any mishap or anything from that category, and remained in better conditions. Indeed, he eats and drinkebs, gathers himself and enters the bathhouse for service, and some have reported that when presenting a case of a wound in a bowl, it was small enough to be touched upon this quality.
It is that he takes large ants, gathers their heads and places an ant on the wound with its mouth open if it grabs it and closes its mouth, then fastens by sticking to it and does not let go, then puts another ant nearby the first one.
He continues to do this with several anangs on the wound, then removes them and stitches the wound so that those heads remain stuck in the bowl until the bowl runs off and hears clear without any signs of pain or irritation; it may also be sewn with a fine thread.
That which pulls the animal firmly after entering a needle and takes one end of this thread of silk then ties it to a fine thin string and enters that string into the piercing. In it, the silk thread is tied to the bowl and then emptied into the cavity; this method of sewing with ants and silk is purely for deceit and not advised.
As for a large and wide rupture, especially if it is in one of the narrow channels, there is no remedy or cure by suturing.
Chapter Six Hundred and Eighty.
In the treatment of diphtheria and nasal congestion.
Know that any wound or ulcer, if it becomes infected and swollen and has not been sutured but continuously produces pus, is always not healing on its own in any part of the body, whether as diphtheria or a nasal condition, we call them both "zukam.
It is indeed a tightly-packed, solid white mass with no pain associated with it, like the hollow of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some of them called it a "feather," and sometimes in certain instances, it would be moist and continuously produce pus which may have occasionally stopped but when present is usually abundant, thick, and fine.
In the division recorded by surgical accounts, it has been suggested that any wound does not heal and new tissue does not grow within because of one of nine possible reasons: either due to a lack of blood in the body or rejection, or perhaps there is solid meat inside which prevents healthy tissue regeneration. Whether it is abundant in dirt and filth, or because the sore itself is infected, or the material used to dress it of inferior quality, or perhaps the medicine employed is unsuitable for treatment, or due to a decay that has set in from tuberculosis type, or some internal issue within the body.
Whether it is abundant in dirt and filth, or because the sore itself is infected, or the material used to dress it of inferior quality, or perhaps the medicine employed is unsuitable for treatment, or due to a decay that has set in from tuberculosis type, or some internal issue within the body. As seen in the city of Serres, where diseases mature and tumors naturally slow down; whether due to one or several bones being fractured. All these causes, signs, and treatments with medicines have been clarified in categorization.
It is necessary for me to inform you about the treatment of scurvy and rheumatism which can be done by hand, know that naviculars may occur in all body parts including significant arteries or nerves.
Or to the phalanges or metacarpus, or to the kidneys, or to a side of the ribs, or to a vertebra from spinal vertebrae, or to a joint among complex joints such as hands and feet, extending near vital organs like that.
From these kinds with this condition, it was the severe and contagious diseases that could not be treated or lived in them after being afflicted, from those kinds for which I did not reach to the positions mentioned above, which I prayed for and hoped to treat them.
I desired to understand this, so you take a file from steel or brass if the Nasor is running along its course, inspect it and then in the Nasor there will be a channel which is inspected with a fine file of silver since silver softens the body.
During entry and turning towards filing, the Nasor had many mouths which could not be deduced from the channel behind it with one of its mouths; the moisture that enters it flows towards the other orifices and escapes.
From there, you could then examine which face is possible for you to recognize if there was a bone or nerve and whether the Nasor's hollow was far or near or it was one Nasor with many mouths and stopped on all that depending on your diligence in inquiring about the sickness and their pain when palpated by your hand at the spot.
In such cases of ulcers, if all this is confirmed to be true in two instances, then proceed with the treatment based on confidence and experience.
The nasal structure appears near or in a healthy position away from the joint, nerve, blood vessel, or vein mentioned earlier. If the nasal bone has moved and grabbed something within it, such as foreign bodies, spoiled meats, or excessive fats, proceed accordingly based on your description.
If something grows in its mouth from meat or sausage, treat it accordingly until relief is achieved; if the nasal structure was protruded and stable, you should extract as deeply as possible and cleanse all spoiled meats within.
Then use the powdered medicine in potent drugs and apply it to the nasal structure that you notice with steel; do so repeatedly until the strong drug consumes all remnants of decay within the nasal cavity.
Then force him to wear the bandages that grew meat correctly until he is relieved; if not, seek further advice on what caused it and remove it thoroughly as advised, ensuring no impediments prevent you from doing so.
"If there is a vein, artery, or organ, as we have said before, then the bone swelling contains some putrefaction and darkness; it goes away with the decay of this filth, which is then treated by beating it until healed, but if not cured, apply pitch like previously done.
"Know that you have not fully eradicated the decay, reveal all on it secondarily, inspect and purify its exterior thoroughly by exerting great effort, then compel it to heal; if healed, know that the decay is elsewhere far from this decay, reveal everything about it secondarily.
"Inspect and purify its exterior thoroughly by exerting great effort, the decayed bone was a small piece that you can attract with fine chisels leading to healing.
"The bones were many, attract all of them with effort and do not leave anything; if you resist something from the ties without it, there is no risk in cutting those ties and meats if they are present to complete the bones.
"The bone extraction has not reached you from your time, wear it on the wound and leave it days until what surrounds that bone dries of meats and ties, then secure the incision so that no blood seeps where you were carving during your work.
Indeed, if you feared that, place a soaked cotton in powdered sulfur mixed with oil or in an Egyptian ointment potion or any of the green plasters; then if it was painted over those ligatures and cracked the bones, it would be easy to remove them.
There was a large bone, similar to the shin or calf bone, and its shape, which had become corrupted; only its surface appeared discolored and decayed. Eventcuetly, the blackness and rot spread, forcing the wound to be cleaned thoroughly before it could be healed because a large part of it had rotten, and the infection reached up to the eye socket, necessitating its removal.
He cut it all off to where the rot ended, then he treated it until it healed, and I inform you that a case was presented of a man with a condition in his leg which served as an example and guidance for your treatment; this man had been suffering from gout.
Around the threescore years old, he presented with pain in his leg due to an internal body movement affecting him until it reached his leg and swelled up significantly, causing no issues from outside initially, but over time it worsened along with a mistake by physicians.
From it flowed abundant and poor materials for its treatment, until the leg swelled up and in it numerous breaths all extended to froth, while body sweats were effectively treated by a group of physicians over two years, none of whom were skilled in handicraft.
Until his intention was fulfilled, I saw the leg and abundant materials emerged from those immense breaths, the man's body healed and turned yellow; it entered a pipe through one of those breaths until the tube reached the bone then all the breaths were examined.
It was found to extend into some of all the leg parts, bursting occurred on one of those breaths until it revealed part of the bone which was corroded, darkened and had rotted and penetrated until the hole reached the brain and spread what emerged from it.
It allowed the corroded bone and I thought it wasn't in any other decay that spread out and scattered, and didn't reabsorb, then made the wound require an extended use of hemostatic drugs for a longer period until no signs appeared then revealed another part of the bone.
"She discovered the infection was connected to the bone, and pierced it so that part also showed signs of the same decay. She then forced it out, but did not force it completely nor cauterize it, but exposed it again so she could gradually remove a piece of the bone at a time until cutting through the bone.
"She extracted it with a sharp instrument, then treated the wound swiftly and thoroughly with medicine for cauterization. Yet this process had to be repeated several times in her work of opening and cutting until the illness reached a severely weakened stage with low chances of success and fears of death due to excessive bleeding.
"It grew at the site of the bone into a solid lump, and its condition in his body improved; it weakened in strength and changed behaviorally, and was not afflicted while walking with an attack that would harm him suddenly, as the bone had been fractured at another location in the body.
"It was necessary to spread it over this type and to tie a tight bandage around the affected bone, and to stretch it high and form another bandage from thicker cloth than the first.
Then you attach it to the muscle under the bone and extend its end so that the muscle is pulled downward, and you expose the place where you want to implant it without letting the saw hurt the meat and put a board or table underneamber of the bone from below.
If you do this and the saw does not stop cutting the diseased bone, the implant should be slightly above the spot of decay to prevent infection from being inside the bone so it doesn't show on the surface for touching; if this happens, you must reimplant it again.
The bone is rotten and does not connect with another, but the decay is inside or between them; you expose all parts of the muscle from each one, then put a board underneath it, and implant it on top where the decay starts.
If you reimplant it from another side and the implant is slightly further along the decay than we said, then the infection was within the broken joint itself, so implanted the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the decay is not in a non-healing joint, but rather in a hand or foot web and it's extremely difficult to treat, still you must uncover the decay as much as possible and remove and cleanse it thoroughly at any cost.
In the event that you need to straighten a bone when it is not infected or gangrenous, be aware that fractures and splints for cutting these bones are numerous depending on the position of the bone, its insertion, thickness, length, width, hardness, and intricacy. Therefore, you should have a device for each type of work related to that issue.
Know that the work itself may be learned from the type of device you need if it is your profession and you are knowledgeable in this trade, as a person skilled in the craft will observe various diseases through it. He may infer for himself devices that are pertinent to each disease and I am versed in this matter as well, with several devices outlined herein.

It was necessary to cut that part where the corruption of the illness had reached, either by death or a major affliction greater than losing the limb itself, and this would indicate that the part has turned black as if the flesh were being burnt by fire.
Or it has turned into decay after the blackness, and that putrefaction would reach the limb to draw it up in the body until one decides to cut it off, and so on if the corruption was due to a growth such as sea urchins or starfish or barnacles.
The corruption or putrefaction in the tip of the finger is only to amputate the finger, and do not delay the decay from reaching the hand likewise if it has taken hold in the hand, then cut off the arm at the elbow, and do not delay the decay from reaching the arm.
Likewise, if it has taken hold in the arm at a joint itself, do not delay amputating near the elbow as the decay approaches towards the shoulder, otherwise if that illness causes death or there is no other possible treatment with energy left.
Also, with the man if putrefaction has taken hold in the finger, amputate the finger at a joint, and if it takes hold on the arm hairs cut off the leg bending at the knee joint.
If the infection has reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to amputate and cauterize the wound; if you wish to cut a limb or spread it, tie knots at the lower location where you want to cut, and tie another knot on top of that position.
The thread of one knot is pulled down, and the thread of another knot on top is pulled up; remove the meat between the two knots with a broad edge until all the flesh has been exposed, then cut or spread it out, ensnaring (the tissue) from every angle.
To ensure the scalpel does not expose too much of the wound causing excess pain and inflammation, if bleeding occurs during your incision procedure quickly stem it or apply some clotting agents before proceeding with treatment until emptied.
Then tie the affected limb with a suitable knot and treat it until healed, for example, I present to you an illustration of a man in his leg portrayed with his eye detailing this case wherein blackness occurred similar to fire burns.
This infection first occurred on his hand until the man took everything, he then sought help from him as soon as he saw the infection spread to the limb with great pain and burns, only to cut it off at the joint.
When a considerable amount of time had passed, he exhibited this corruption through his finger on the claw which was used for amputations. To prevent such contamination from occurramoisture and medication that remained on his body after cleansing, he would not allow these residues to remain in his hand. Instead, he would wipe them off with another finger.
Until the corruption spread to his hand, and he feared it would continue in his left one after amputation; so he prayed for strength during this operation on a dying limb as its power was fading, but when Manna passed away, he withdrew to his country.
He told me that he had only amputated his hand with a pair of scissors, but I recounted this story to serve as assistance in cases of this disease and as evidence from which one might deduce actionable insights.
The Eighth and Eighty Chapter. (This is a title, so the translation would remain unchanged.)
In treating abscesses and how to administer medication for them. (This is also a title, so the translation would remain unchanged.)
If a tumor occurs in some muscular parts and the duration of the tumor continues until it has fully formed then bursts or deflates, resulting in all its contents exiting from the period, leaving the location empty as if in a vessel. (This is a description and not a title; however, since no further guidance was provided on handling descriptions, we'll keep to direct translation.)
The skin which has become like a perforation and is not severe in decay, does not affect the bone, nerve, or sinew, and from here it deserves to be called encapsulated; Nasir did not name anything except for when the decay reaches one of these parts.
At that time, Nasir names it either as an abscess or a ziqqum and treats the skin to be removed entirely while turning, especially if it has become perforated and is confirmed not to adhere to its original position due to decay.
The skin adhered and the decay did not reach that extent, and it was in a hardening of fatty tissue; treating it involved injection, and upon examining the abscess, it was found to be large with cream extending from it giving off an odor treated with Egyptian medicine.
It is a mixture of oil, honey, and vinegard parts which gather in a vessel heated until the medicine dries and comes to caramelization, then take it with your pot, dilute it with water and huge, inject into the abscess, press its mouth, and leave the medicine inside for two hours.
Then let him be taken out during the setting and perform this for days until the abscess is cleansed and pus comes out, and he may inject with red lead water if this medicine does not reach him, and indeed take red lead powder from grapes or oak leaves mixed with water.
Then stand him up and inject it until the abscess is sure to have been cleaned, if not in the illness there will be no need for Egyptian medicine or red lead water after having mixed something with honey and wax.
Or inject it with honey and wine, as the honey will cleanse and wash away while the wine will stick to the abscess, especially if the wine is thickened; do this several times until it's sure that the pus has gone out of him by putting meat in it.
As if you take the rose syrup and dissolve it with red wine vinegar or inject him with some of the drugs and dressings that we have proven their properties in the article on dressings, then the abscess's mouth was narrowed and not wide enough for the syringe.
Widen it slightly with iron or place a well-melted wax thread in the Egyptian padlock or Seriquon clamp until it expands. Likewise, if the mouth is also wide, join its edges with suturing and leave it open as much as necessary for the inserted instrument to enter.
Also, if the mouth which is filled with wax extends too high, open it in a lower place to insert more wcuws from below; this prevents meat in the storage container from growing within.
It is not possible to open the container towards below as you desire; form an opening through which wax may be easily inserted according to your preference, ensebring no residual wax remains in it.
As for the drugs placed on top of the container, how to position them so that one takes from one of the clamps is to take up an issue and lengthen it using a strip of leather such that it covers the entire container. Then file a hole slightly larger than the mouth of the container and lengthen another strip of leather to cover it as far as possible, placing them separately at intervals from the mouth of the container so that the wax can easily come out but only removing large strips afterward.
For several days, and as for the one on a hidden mouth, it is the one that removes it at each time so that whatever accumulamo in it may come out; to recognize what flows from it: whether much or little, stinky or not stinky.
With this, also inspect the position of the abscess itself: does its owner feel pain or not; is there pus or not? If treatment continues in this way and you see material flowing from the mouth of the abscess.
Know that if the abscess has adhered or stuck together, then leave it for two days or on the third day; when examining the wound replace the torn part with another and apply a dressing: after a long period, effluent from the abscess will come out in a thin consistency without foulness.
It is close to the case of people who delay healing their wounds, and on the contrary those from whom it does not adhere: after many days effluent comes out from the abscess that is not ripe; know that if the abscess has not adhered then its delayed pus.
His time will be prolonged by a drying ointment and the medicine to be in its composition humid yet solid like natrum: if it has increased therein, add an increase of powder; and from those who report he is treated with taking natrum.
He softens the skin with rose oil and rubs it with aged, moderate wine in its texture. Then he kneads it with this and utilizes it, doing such a thing if the balm of henna is not present when he boils it until foamy or uses it or takes lard, asafoetida, cinnamon and crushes all together and grinds it on honey. And it is on fire. Then he wraps it in a cloth and presses it onto the pack or pours on the honey that was boiled until foamy, grinds over it with spices, places the cloth, and tightens it.
He may utilize long sutures, Ammangon root, curcuma poudre and saffron in one or multiple to crush it, extract from them essence, grind on honey as described and use this mixture; if the packing is not healed despite a considerable time, then be aware that there may be an underlying disease.
It has affected the bones or solid cranial nerves or tendons, treating Nasopharyngitis with this remedy is effective for what presents.
The ninth and eighty-eighth chapter.
In the treatment of ankle, a swoln toe and finger, cutting off extra fingers, and separating fused digits.
The dach is a large piece of meat that grows under the tip of the thumb or toe and sometimes it appears on all the fingers; if neglected and untreated, swelling and redness can occur.
Or it can rot until the root of the finger is eaten away, and maybe it corrupts entirely with decay, possibly reaching to the bone causing a foul odor and becoming wide at the end of the finger resembling rotting meat, if treated as we previously mentioned by division but did not heal.
It was recommended to cut off all the excess growing from the finger and then scrape the wound afterward, as this is highly beneficial; if the bone is intact and the finger too.
The angle of the finger's hollow has trapped the meat inside, causing swelling and pain; it was advised to place a fine poultice underneculed area of the finger where the meat is lodged and elevate it above then cut that meat gently.
Apply a heated ointment to the remaining meat until all of it dissolves, then treat with bandages until recovery; if decay has affected the bone, it is advised to cut out and remove that bone as it will not recover due to the severely infected bone.
You have seen the eating and decaying, strive to cut it off in one of the limbs when he refers to something that appears, then treat it until cured; if the toe is struck or satisfied, a severe pain occurs, so the disease should first be removed.
Then the toe is cut with a sharp instrument making an oblique incision from top to bottom, and care must be taken not to extend the incision into the meat beneath the toenail; this leads to severe pain in the illness, causing swelling of flesh at that site, then treat the position by residing there.
As for the swollen fingertips that occur in some people, where all of them are meaty or maybe one has bones and maybe there is a nail, so it may have been originated from a joint between some fingers.
Or its source is in some finger limbs that do not move and are grown from finger joints, perhaps they moved so it was only meaty; then it is easy to cut them off completely or separate by cutting at the root with a sharp instrument.
Regarding the plant whose root is at the origin of the joint, its treatment is difficult and involves cutting it off entirely, whereas for those that grow on a finger near one of the phalanges, it should first be cut in a rounded manner towards the bone, then spread the bangs using one of those suitable tweezers.
Then treat it until he recovers, and as for the fusion that frequently exposes the fingers to each other, if this is what causes bony growths in humans and occurs during joint injury or burning of a similar nature, then cutting into such fusions should be performed.
Until the fingers return to their natural position, then place a wick or compress soaked in rose oil between them so that they do not rub against each other quickly and separate them or make a thin sheet of metal barrier until the joint heals properly as it should.
Likewise, if the fusion is exposed to fingers by hand, cut into that fusion as deemed appropriate and restore it with bone grafting.
Section Nine.
Cut the tumor. (Assuming "Ø§ÙØ¯ÙØ§ÙÙ" is a typo for "Ø§ÙØ£ÙÙØ±Ø©" which means 'tumor' in Arabic)
The veins are congested, dark and curiously blackish; they occur more frequently in certain body parts and most notably in the legs, particularly in the calves, ankles, and heels. It is adviseb to initially employ vigorous leg massages.
Next, drain the pustule with a lancet, and if treated with iron, one of them should be scraped to release dark blood and let the other bleed until it drips out thickly. If scraping is done on this kind, warm water will initially soften the leg.
Until the thick blood clot dissolves, tighten the leg from above to below its bandage and scrape the sweat at one or two points or three wide scrapes.
Then, the black blood is drained from your hand from below the leg upwards and vice versa until enough blood is expelled or as much as the condition permits, then bind it and apply a compress avoiding foods that cause constipation after the dark period and defecate again.
When the veins are filled and cause a disease, if it is of this nature, let the leg'hem be removed if there is much hair on it; then enter the bath and soak its foot in hot water until it turns red and starts to sweat or a strong exercise occurs.
If it has not yet been to the bath and heated up the limb, then scrape off the skin along with the sweat either at its end near the ankle or below near the knee; then open the skin with a needle and let the sweat flow out from each side until it is visible.
When it appears red and swoln, if the skin has come off as well, then apply a poultice underneath until it rises and exits through the skin; wrap it with an opaque bandage, then make another incision near that cut by about three fingers' breadth.
Then remove the skin over the sweat until it appears; then lift it with a poultice as before and wrap with another bandage, then make another or several more incisions if needed.
Then he soaks and cuts it in the last gap near the knee, then draws it out until it exits from the second gap, then pulls it to the gap above, making this happen until pulled from the third gap higher up all of them until they have all exited, then cut off.
It is not necessary for you to draw and tie a double-strength cord in the vein, connect it, pull, insert something undernecuffolding above, and grip all around until he exits without breaking; if broken then it becomes difficult for him as much as possible to hold onto.
If it is infected, if all of him has been bandaged, place on a surgical location with melted wool in wine and grease or red or oil and treat until healed, the function was trembling with convulsions towards his limbs.
It was not as we have stated that you should pull at all parts of its convulsions and placements, then suspend it with pincers until pulled out completely, keeping your cuts from bleeding or wounding; if he becomes difficult to hold onto then preserve the effort.
Image of a cleft that the dentist cuts with it:
Picture of an amputated hornless ram:
It does not resemble the usual appearance of ram horns, nor is its edge sharp enough to pierce the skin or thick in bend as if it were a soft carving that has been cut with scissors so that it possesses a hardness similar to what we have said.
The surgical section and the ninth.
In the vein of moderation:
This vein is produced in the ankles of hot countries like Hajaz, Arab lands, and places with little fertile soil; perhaps it also originates from other parts of the body that are not feet, and its production occurs due to a skin disease:
As it occurs in the living abdomen and tapeworm, carrot worm, and meat tapeworm that is produced between skin and muscle, a sign of this vein occurr. It starts to happen in the ankle with severe heat then heals at the site before secreting blood from that place:
If it comes out of its end in the form of a plant or animal, then if any small piece of lead is tied on it with wire ranging from one to two drachms, it should be twisted and left hanging from the leg:
Whenever something is removed outside through a hole in the metal and its joints are severely twisted, cut off part of it and wrap the remainder without cutting from the root until it all comes out because if you cut it, it will shrink and enter into the flesh causing inflammamoation and infection at the site.
Therefore, it should be allowed to slowly drain and squeeze a little until all of it comes out leaving nothing in the body, and from this pus may come out in some people measuring five fingers' widths long.
It has reached a point where it exited from a man measuring twenty finger breadths long, so when treating him you should insert a rod in the hole and plug with a long piece of wood attached to the body until everything comes out leaving nothing behind, then attempt healing the site using medication for several days.
Then treat it with tumor therapy, and if this pus has many branches especially if it appeared in the man's joint or within the body itself causing numerous symptoms resulting from each mouth discharging its content as we mentioned before regarding treatment by division and what follows.
Chapter II and IX.
In the case of a snakebite occurramoled under the fingernail, called cattle pox.
This disease is called cattle pox in some countries because it often affects cows and is caused by a small snake that breeds between the skin and muscle, causing an upward and downward discharge throughout the body.
It becomes evident when it spreads from one limb to another until it breaks through where the skin was previously breached, and exits while becoming a type of infection consisting of various mixtures as seen in worms, animals, and apples within the abdomen.
However, it is expected to affect if it spreads through the body and rises up to the head reaching the eyes, potentially causing them to open and exit, thus saving the eyes greatly; however, if one desires treatment and expulsion, that would only occur upon its discharge and manifestation for touch.
It should be tightly wrapped above and below with strong bandages, then it should be punctured and removed; if it has sunk into the muscle, it may not be found on its original location until set ablaze, and the greatest expected spread of it to the eyes as we have said.
Indeed, it has become in the head near the eye and was tied under the chin with a good knot then untied and removed from it. The patient should agree to purify their body with suitable medicines for bad moldy mixtures and prevent foods that cause infection.
Chapter Three and Nine.
In the incision for a condition known as scrofula.
This condition called scrofula in our country, which is a pain that begins in one organ and then moves to another, is as you have described it to me.
I advised a woman with an illness in one of her limbs, and she uncovered her arm; after blowing gently on the wrist bandage connected to the arm for an hour, when it remained I saw this air movement rising up towards the elbow as fast as possible, similar to how a snake arches its back.
If the pain were to move from one place to another, it would cease at that spot and remain in the elbow; after an hour, I observed a glow spreading throughout her body until it reached the other arm, then she told me that her entire body was spinning as I had seen.
What astonished me was the speed of his transition from limb to limps and I had never seen this disease in such a manner except that I saw a group of people with pain who underwent a similar transition from limb to limp as I witnessed herein this woman.
I could not but think that this was for the purpose of the woman being from a tribe with stiff bodies, exposed to the heart, and showing such breathlessness therefrom as would not appear on this scale among those who are fat and well-fleshed internally.
If you wish to treat him and he feels the pain, then raise his leg quickly and open it until that retained breath escapes out.
It was not that you saw him treat his body by expelling the winds and promoting their excretion as do ginger, sesame, and herbs of similar nature with medicines.
Chapter Fourteenth and Nineteen.
In the expulsion of the arrow shafts.
The arrows may differ according to their types and the locations they are found in the body, and as for their differences by type thereof: some of them are large, some small; some hollow glasses, some opaque; some have three angles, others with four angles.
From them, those with teeth and cusps; as for the parts that have organs in it, they are on two sides: either these organs are principal hollowed-out ones such as the brain and heart and liver and lungs and intestines and bladamo and spleen. When the arrow fell into one of these organs, signs of death appeared to you as I have described them that it should be avoided letting out that arrow from there and death then takes its owner in most cases. And when these signs do not appear and the arrow does not fall out of the organ, treat the wound; from signs of the brain if the arrow penetrates it and exits through the bone and the fissure on the brain, then it exhibits severe headache and dizziness.
And when these signs do not appear and the arrow does not fall out of the organ, treat the wound; from signs of the brain if the arrow penetrates it and exits through the bone and the fissure on the brain, then it exhibits severe headache and dizziness. Red in the eyes and tongue, convulsions, confusion, throwing up once, and perhaps blood exits from the nostrils or ears, and perhaps speech stops and voice goes out and moisture leaves the wound site resembling a pus-like discharge and watering occurs from it.
Indeed, these signs have appeared to you in treating the illness and extracting the thorn if it has not yet been extracted; as for thorn marks if the heart is affected and is close to the left side, feel that it seems to have protruded into something solid rather than empty space.
Perhaps the thorn moved like a heartbeat, and blood leaked from the wound was black, followed by cold extremities and pale sweating; be aware that death is irreversible in this case, as indicated by thorn marks if the lung is punctured with oily blood seeping from the wound.
The veins that reach the neck become inflamed, and the color of the illness changes, with high breathing, and they request cold air inhalation; if the thorn puncture occurs at a membrane in the chest, it is close to small ribs with severe breathing and intense pain.
All abdominal organs tremble and move, and if the thorn punctures the liver, it follows with intense pain and blood leaking from the wound resembling liver color in its redness; if the thorn punctures the intestine, perhaps undigested food oozes out of the wound.
His order is apparent, and if the sword perforates the abdamnity or lodges therein, causing something to leak from the wound, tumor, or a ruptured pouch that cannot be healed by treatment nor through the discharge of the sword, then the sword enters the gallbladder and expels bile.
Among them, something leaks outside and the pain intensifies for the patient, knowing it is a hernia; as for the other parts such as the head, eyes, neck, arms, shoulders, ribs, back, thighs, legs, etc., they have been transferred on command.
If the sword did not encounter a vessel or nerve and was not poisoned, I will inform you of something that has been seen from these swords so as to deduce your treatment; namely, that the sword may have penetrated into a man's eyebrow at its origin.
It was expelled from the other side under his eyebrow skin, and he is well without any eye injury; another sword exited a Jew who had been perforated in the eyelid skin below the lashes, and the sword slanted away without causing anything but its small tip that attaches to bone.
"Two large spears from the Jewish surgical instruments were square iron blades without ears and did not cause an accident in its eye, and another arrow was released from a pair of scissors-like implements, and the arrow was Arabian.
"He who had ears punched through his glasses, and it seemed to have slipped in its loop until the Crusaders released him unharmed, and another arrow was released for a man who appeared to be wounded in his abdestein and we estimated that he would die from it.
"After a period of thirty or so days, nothing changed in his condition; the arrow was removed from him with some difficulty and healed completely without any mishap occurring to him, and I saw a man who had an arrow injury on his back that had been infected.
"When the arrow exited its entry point after seven years, I saw a woman who had an arrow injury in her abdomen with an infected wound, and the arrow remained without any change in her condition, nor did she find any harm from her natural actions.
I saw another man who had an arrow in his face, with the wound bandaged and he experienced little pain, this is a similar case, two arrows were extracted from a man serving under the Sultan; one that entered into his nose reaching towards the right side slightly.
The arrow was completely removed and treated after three days from the impact of the arrow; I examined the wound closely with a fine needle, and did not feel anything, but found it painful under his right ear through a narrow opening.
I found that the initial pain from the arrow was sutured at the location with a dressing, it has healed and attracted granulation; I foresaw signs of inflammation around the site becoming more prominent, no incident occurred in the location indicating that the arrowhead reached its full depth.
The dressing was applied for many days without any incident, the illness ended being completely healed after it was removed; a few days later I felt the arrow in his nose and informed him that an antibiotic ointment had been applied to the wound repeatedly over several days.
Until I opened it and examined it, I felt the gentle pin attached to the wood, then I applied that precise medication through the wound by which Elyon appeared before us with a gaze from one side of the arrowhead and passed away some time afterwards.
Then, as the wound expanded and allowed access to the channels within it, attracting and moving them, no longer able to exit, I stopped and relied on an assortment of instruments until one day he was captured with tightly closed channels which had appeared in a previous vision.
The physicians ruled that the growth in his nose must not be forcibebrated, nor should the wound be sutured and the patient's health fully healed without being afflicted by any illness at all; I inform you of how to extract some arrows to make this a measure and guide as to what I have not mentioned.
Because these aspects of the craft and its details are not described in a description, nor is there any mention of it at all; only the skilled maker measures little about much and as he has on what is lacking he deduces new work and a new device when encountering an unusual situation.
If the projectiles fall from this craft, then I say that the arrows only exit from the limbs in which they were inserted either by the attraction of the position they came from or against the opposite side, and those that exit from where they entered.
Either the arrow is prominent in a muscle position, attracting and exiting, or it should not leave from the time it was inserted until the surrounding muscle around it has become easier to attract and exit, including if it becomes lodged in a bone.
You should also not leave the arrow for days and return it attracting and moving every day as it exits, you should not exit after days that it was appropriate to pierce around the arrow in the same bullseye from every side with a gentle needle until it expands allowing for attraction and exit.
The embedded arrow in the skull bone had penetrated into one of the brain cavities and showed signs of illness with some of the symptoms you mentioned, seizing on attracting the arrow and leaving it until its matter is relieved after days.
If the spear is deeply embedded and cannot be pulled, do not use forceps to remove it as I described for you; instead, treat the location until he recovers. And if the spear has slipped into another part of the body. And when he lost sensation while probing with a probe, I felt it being attracted by some instruments that work for its removal; but it could not pass through the wound and around the spear in the thigh, without bone or nerve or vein.
He was able to extract the spear once the wound had enlarged and it could pass through; there were two ends that grabbed onto the nail in them from all sides with any trick possible, and take it if you cannot remove the flesh around the ears after breaking.
And if you tried to extract the spear from any place, then you worked with your fingers all around until it was extracted and accompany very gentle handling so that the spear does not break easily; but it could not be pulled out when attempting its attraction and extraction.
Until the meat has rotted, then when you return it will be easier; prevent excessive bleeding by doing what we mentioned in its section regarding treatment. Preserve your effort with a leech or ligature or tourniquet and use the method.
Completely simplify the instrument and do so gently, as you described, securing it properly; when attracted by a magnet, the disease should appear on its original form upon the incidence of the prong.
You cannot do so, use what you can from the forms; if the prong protrudes from the opposite side either something has emerged outside or find the end of the prander feeler on the skin near to it.
Extract as much of the gallbladps on it as possible then attract it, and it will be easier to remove; hold a scalpel from your fingertip in rotation until the prong affects the bone and expands within itself before extracting.
Otherwise, leave it for days until expelled; if the prong is reinserted in it, then it has been pushed with a rod and the pin dropped so insert a pushing device into its cavity along the axis of the peg and push it outwardly.
Then the arrow was hollowed, and it was pushed through using an instrument that entered into that cavity; thus, the arrow is eased out of its exit. If the arrow was poisoned within (the body), one should ensure that all the flesh in which the poison remains has been consumed, then treat accordingly if possible.
The arrow that was located in the chest, abdabdom, or kidney, or side, and was almost as if it were pinched by a needle; you can tear out and preserve parts like blood vessels or nerves while extracting.
Then the wound would need to be sutured, and then treated until it heals; image of the threads that attract arrows:.
Its ends resemble the beak of a bird, as if it were a pincers capturing an arrow or something similar; from these could originate large and small types and medium ones all depending on the thickness of the arrowhead and its size along with the extent and narrowness of the wound.

Chapter Five and Nine.
In the abdominal cavity.
The abdomina cavity in which the usual veins are drained from the body, thirteen veins into the head, sixteen arteries known as the pulse points behind both ears and the eyebrows, two veins found at each inner corner of the eyes called the nasals.
And the vein located in the middle of the forehead, and the vein found at the side of the nose, and the vessels within the neck, and the veins on the upper lip from the mouth, and the veins on the lower lip - these veins are known as the jugulars and labial arteries.
As for the veins that drain from the arm and hand, there are five: one is called the cephalic vein which comes from the wolf side, commonly known as the head's vein; another is the basilic vein or middle vein, formed by a confluence of trunks from the palmar branch and part of the antecubital fossa.
And the palmar branch, from the human side, also known as the antecumvental vein and commonly called the abdominal vein; the arm's trunk, located along the forearm, is a confluence of branches above the elbow with clear visible signs; the ulnar vein or humeral branch - it attaches to it, known as the humeral vein.
This is the vein that between khuná¹£ir and baná¹£ar has two branches, on the leg are three veins one of which under the thigh band from the wild side and the second narrow and its place near the knee on the human side and the vein of women and its place behind the bend on the wild side.
On the other leg there are three veins like that, as for the two veins behind the ears benefit from them draining chronic drips and the twin sister and scrofula and severe head sores.
It is that the swelling of the head heals and its posterior drains well, so it hangs from a vein in place with sores and then strangles the disease by wrapping it tightly until the veins appear and their positions behind the ears are low on the head; examine them with your finger where you feel pulsing under your finger there you determined it with wax.
Then you take a surgical knife known as the scalpel then you enter it under the vein in the skin until reaching the bone then raise your hand with the vein and skin above and cut the vein along with the skin into a neat incision of about two fingers wide.
He proceeds and sends blood as much as one desires, then restrains them with a ligature and leaves until they are unconscious; in the first book he makes an incision and ties their vessels, and for the two veins that lie on the temples, it is beneficial to sever them from the sister who has chronic pain, severe headache, and constant swelling reaching the eyes.
By tying them with a band until the perspiration appears, indicating their clear presence; by feeling under your finger and noting their pulsation, you learn how to tie it properly and raise the skin from the top of the perspiration above the joint using your thumb.
The non-inflated catheter is inserted from below and raised, as it was done in the other two veins; send blood according to your need then unblock the blockage, place your thumb on the perspiration for an hour.
Then place a silk and ligature on it, tie them tightly, and leave until they are unconscious; the veins have been mentioned in the first book as being cut and tied off, and after severing the temporal vessels, it is beneficial for chronic facial swelling, such as rosacea, pustules, and blushing.
How to perform a ligature on what I have described to you that will strangle the illness and tighten its neck with an envelope until blood is seen, then take the instrument which is called the saw, and this is her appearance: [image or description of the instrument]
The nail-tipped saw is placed on the same vein as with a sponge or something similar, and blood flows into the container you want to use; then it cures the illness by tightening until relief is felt.
It should only be opened by a broad blade, not sharp on the edge like most scalpels, but rather slightly broader; it is used to correct a deviation because if done near a bone and the blade is too delicate, it may break into pieces.
The veins behind the eyes are effective for treating eye ailments such as swelling, redness, tearing, and facial diseeback of the illness by tightening its neck with an envelope until blood is seen, then cut them off while standing on your head to correct any deviation slightly along their length using a small broad blade.
If the spot is not too close to a bone, then if the blade is delicate it may break; send blood to your container and cover them with cotton wool, tighten overnight and cure them, while nasal veins are beneficial for severe fevers.
Severe headaches and face diseases such as red sores that appear on the nose, especially if chronic; how to alleviate it by pulling on the affected area until your left hand grabs the nose and takes a fine long pincers.
It protrudes from the center of the rabbit itself between the nose joints upright, as there is no pulsation to be felt here because blood emerges from its veins; you should pinch it slightly with your forceps and send some blood back into the vessel, then tie it off at night so that it quickly subsides.
Removing cysts is beneficial; at the beginning of sores and black diseases that appear on the skin, such as black patches, ulcers, and rotten sores and bites; how to alleviate it by pulling under them in their neck with forceps while the surgeon stands over their head.
The patient lies on a chair; the vein is cut along its length to drain widely and slightly, then it shrinks with moderate blood or as much you need from there; do the same with another vee
The secretion of the two veins is moderately tightened so that it does not suffocate the disease, and by morning he recovers from the wound; as for the vein at Jarkh, its removal is beneficial after the excision of the quifa because it helps against tooth cavities in the mouth, gum decay, bad ulcers, splitting of the nails, and bad ulcers.
When near the nose, and at about that level, remove them so that the disease is pressed in front of you, your neck tightens under a cloak, then his nails change and he looks at the two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left. You cauterize them with their pus.
That also, their veins are small and dark and you should cut them off at the edge, what form will show up on you, do not let it grow or become larger, but create them in the lower lips as well.
As for the two veins under the tongue, their removal is beneficial after excision of the quifa which are in the throat from diseases of coughing and mouth ailments; remove them so that they sit between your hands like sun glasses, raise his jaw and look beneath it, one side with a vein and the other side with a vein, their color turns to blackness.
They dissected them and preserved such that they did not touch the sections, for underneebottom there were vessels, and blood would leak from these vessels; as for the three veins in the annexation, those which usually cause the bleeding were separated and also the ones that are on both sides.
If they inserted a broad rehna leaf or olive onto the incision, or if they cut it with a surgical knife and left it hanging [and this is an image of him]: Image of the broad rehna leaf insertion.
The incision as you see will suffice to open the prominent, bulging filled veins that leak thick blood, and this is an image of the olive insertion.
This insertion is narrower and longer at the end to stop veins that leak yellowish thin blood, and this is an image of the surgical knife insertion.
This surgical knife is used to cut and is of types and thinness according to the size and narrowness of the veins; one may deduce from this about others as well, which are known at the workshop.
As one of these three veins is beneficial to stop, it attracts blood from the channels that are under the throat and neck which drain into the chest and abdomen; when stopping this vein, one should be cautious and have a ligature on the same side so as not to make an error and increase the risk of inserting the insertion into that vessel.
In the event of a blood leakage, it is preferable that it not be stopped with an arterial ligature but rather released through a slit using a needle; if a clear sign does not appear, one should avoid and alter to something else or take part of it.
If it is separated from its place, use the sling of the arm and clarify by slitting with a needle as we said that you wanted to stop (the bleeding) visually; before tightening the arm, ensure the position until you recognize the pulse location then learn about it using thread.
Then secure the arm and slit the vein obliquely with a needle as we said, so that it bleeds from a distance from the blood vessel's position; when you tighten the bandage, if you see pulsation in the place where you learned with thread, then that pulsation is arterial pulse and avoid it.
The blood stopped as expected, and the blood appeared thin red, recognizing that it is arterial blood; then you pressed for a long time with your finger on it before removing it, so that the blood stops frequently when the arm is tightened.
Leave him, and prevent the patient from neglecting himself; let him lie down and not move for several days until he recovers. If no bloodletting has occurred yet, it will happen now. And if you have not given him an emetic drug during your visit, when his fingers start to shrink back, bleeding will occur at the extremities.
Take a grape skin and tear it, then take half of it to bind firmly at the site of the pulsation with cotton or bandages until the next day; bleeding will occur and if you treat him as he has described from the technique of compressing veins, cutting off blood is not difficult in most cases.
For a small wound, ensure that the bandage is applied to the arm; for the bright vein, it is beneficial if it draws blood from above the head and below the body so that it becomes congested by capillary and artery branches as we have said.
The emetic should be on the arm after purging, if under it there is a nerve then it increases in the local of injection and injures the nerve causing confusion in breathing and perhaps not recovering at all; this nerve often shows many sensations.
Indeed, some people hide it and is a fine that does not become apparent what you should make of your wound by making an incision with tweezeback and avoiding the nerve so that when there was blood between two nerves extended the blood lengthwise, but as for the suture bleeding it is beneficial to close it because it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases and should be sutured in this vein, but if you want to tie it: use a fig or bay leaf ligature because it closes the veins as all of them have no artery and nerve.
However, it should be avoided to use the ligature on muscle tissue only and require a loose positioning, not harm if by the first strike does not touch again for suturing repeatedly except that perhaps it swells in some people if not sutured properly at first.
However, this swelling does not harm it in any way, and as for the suturing technique and its features what should progress in healing it firstly one should learn that suturing is either to preserve health only.
If in the case of diseases and those that are used to preserve health, sustain it, and prevent diseases from occurratur, then there should be a discharge in one of the three veins located at the joint known as the carotid artery, the jugular vein, or the vertebral vein. It should occur at the beginning of spring if swelling signs appear.
The discharge should occur on Saturday or Tuesday after the day has passed for three hours, while in the case of diseases there is no fixed time but when necessity and urgency arise from night or day.
In every hour and at every moment, it is not permissible for boys to discharge until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years do so under any circumstance.
It was necessary to purge the pouch before discharging with a gentle incision if there is an abundant abscess that will attract towards the veins when the pus from the sore drains out, harming vital organs. Diabetic and obese individuals should not discharge until they have stopped these conditions.
Be wary as well of diarrheoa, vomiting, and dysentery, and the most of fever, fatigue, exercise, staying up late, fasting, and anything that weakens either body or soul; then examine for concoction before it if the blood is thick.
By food and drink, if possible, then enter the bathing room if nothing prevents it or some exercise helps to clear his blood and causes him to evacuate in the morning as we said, and make sure he voids that morning of all bad mental influences.
As frenzy, anger and fear, among all physical defects like fatigue, excessive sitting, diarrhoea, etc., gather his things in the way people use them for pleasant scents and breezes and amusements of that kind as far as each person can manage.
Then the patient lies on a bed higher than the one he usually lies on, then moves his arm and massages it in his hand twice or thrice; then tightens the ligature with the stick and removes it twice or thrice and makes sure to pull gently.
Because the grip, when not moderate, either by excess in the grip prevents blood flow or if it is too relaxed also prevents bleeding; then after the grip one should massage all fingers together with pressure.
Until the chest swells and becomes palpable to touch; then the surgical needle should be wiped with aged olive oil, after which the little finger of the left hand is placed on the same area under the spot where it intends to stop the bleeding slightly so that the blood does not flow from the incision. Because when the chest is gripped during cessation, it may be filled with air and whenever the needle is placed on it descends undernelevating the neednose which deceives the surgeon and does not allow blood to flow through the incision; if it opens then it will only open slightly.
Therefore, the surgeon should secure and be at ease in all matters; then lower the needle so that blood flows from the incision after a few moments or return to slightly below or above that spot quickly if it does not settle.
If the inflammamo onion or the suture of a wound is not healed in one or two days, and if the bandage does not loosen, it may bring about an intense swelling and will not enter the bath, then if it returns to normal by love, the sponge was inserted and the opening was small and bleeding ran thinly.
I fear that he does not leave the amount of blood you want, so take out the sponge from the wound itself and put it back on at intervals, squeeze a little more into the opening and do this quickly before the place swells again as in many people a small incision can become inflamed.
I saw that it had become inflamed and was not cured, so you should apply something to it; ointment is best as blood flows easily from there, better than the oil itself or any other salves.
Work with ointment on all your sutures in the abd groin when bleeding occurs and it will do so for terebinth resin or wax-emollient if placed on the spot, then blood flows thinly and dissolves if one of them is applied to thicken.
Indeed, a large abscess and tumor often occur, especially in those who have not been treated or where the pus discharge has been minimal. One should apply poultice on the swelling with soaked cloths in boiled water and salt heated slightly, and it will dissolve after an hour.
It should be done after the blood has completely drained from the pus or from another discharge; if it remains in place for a few days, turning black or green, then apply something mixed with honey and vinegar dissolved in water to treat it.
Or something similar to aloe extract, and often a tumor or abscess occurs when applying the poultice with your hand; if you find it spreading, beware as this is a sign of error. Be sure to use something we mentioned earlier on it.
It may start bleeding due to small blood vessels, but bandage it with a pressure dressing to firm up the area and then treat it using all remedies until healed. Each person should let out as much blood as they can handle, usually showing most commonly in red color from the blood.
He who has black blood, let it flow until it turns red; if you see it thick, send it until it liquefies; and likewise for very dense blood until the clot is removed; this applies to someone with strong, powerful urges to bleed all at once.
It is adviser for someone who has a small scrotum to have the epididymis be wider and if he was weak, it's better in that regard; and they should bleed in multiple sessions with a narrow puncture; using an oblique incision with a wide slit without tearing is preferred.
This method of bleeding is suitable for draining and cutting nerves, performed by Ahmed and Aslam with the correct width and length; if it's a case of suffocated bleeding, it was advised to feed him something from leavened bread soaked in pomegranate juice or plums before hemorrhaging.
If the condition is moist and bleeds three times or four, one with a disturbed mood should take leavened bread soaked in mead, honey-sweetened wine, or good quality raisin wine before hemorrhaging.
Indeed, when a person experiences hemorrhage following surgery and the cause is excessive blood loss, it should be treated with meat broth, delicate myrrh-based wine, and heavily concentrated perfumes; one must inflate their chest and expel through the affected area as previously mentioned in our section on treating an effusion.
For one who wishes to relieve their arm and quicken the blood, if it has been excessively purged with weakened force, they should allow some blood to flow slightly over a few days.
For one who wishes to relieve their arm and quicken the blood, if they are strong-bodied, do so for seven or nine hours after the initial evacuation; if one desires to draw the blood toward a body part where it has previously been directed, on the second or third day.
For one who has an abundance of blood that is hot and congested, causing fever, it should be expelled all at once in a large amount and widen the opening so that the effusion can be examined thoroughly after evacuation. Place your hand on the pulse during bleeding to avoid death occurring at the site of concealment, as this is often revealed if the deceiver fails and neglect occurs; it should not be too late to uncover the sleight and stop the bleeding.
The egress of blood has caused the skin to tighten severely or swell significantly, which is very uncomamoor; either leave it until it becomes a fatal condition or use an incision to drain any clotted blood in the vein.
Or if something with salt in water or a bitter purgative is applied and gently rubbed until the blood drains, it may have caused the vein to become swollen.
Do not touch until the swelling subsides, as necessity dictates that you should stop the bleeding immediately and either release it above or drain from another arm or vein.
If the armband is to be released with ointment and sulphur, use either if they are concealed together, or how to release it so that when the case enters the hot water until the tip turns red and clear veins appear clearly; then tighten slightly above it using a bandage.
Then, the bleeding is stopped by a slight displacement and it has no width or length; let the opening be wide and your incision should slightly exceed the joint of the hand, so that blood cannot flow out again when you place the hand in hot water, but allows the blood to drain into the water.
Until you realize that during summer days, if your hand is placed in hot water again and more so it allows blood to flow into the hot water in winter, this bleeding stops from all veins. Because there is no artery or nerve below it, and the incision of Asymm from the right hand is beneficial for hepatitis causes and how to stop it so that your finger joints are held together by bandaging or your hand after entering it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no artery or nerve below it, and the incision of Asymm from the right hand is beneficial for hepatitis causes and how to stop it so that your finger joints are held together by bandaging or your hand after entering it in hot water until the vein swells. It becomes clearly felt then, the incision is made with a slight displacement in all and it does not harm you at all, and your hand is preserved by wearing gloves so that below it are nerves of the fingers and the area is reddened from muscles, then return your hand to hot water.
And if the blood flows into it, then if you do not place your hand in hot water again clots form within the vein and stop bleeding if a lot of blood comes out from the vein apply oil and salt to it so that it does not heal quickly.
Also, in all narrow parts, and as for the removal of the left hand, it is beneficial for fistula cases, likewise perform the same with the scissors as you did with the second one, and the sickle was useful for diseases located below the body such as those related to the genitals.
Retention of menstrual flow, kidney diseeback and chronic leg sores, along with related illnesses, how to remove them so that the patient enters hot water and carries it until the veins burst then press over the joints of the foot using a sponge or cloth at the ankle level resembling the thumb.
It branches out on the man's face in many parts, remove it further to a wider area or near the ankle where it is better and smoother; removing it from the man's face preserves the nerves underneath his skin.
Make your removal slightly off as if you want to slip, so the sponge is slippery; the blood should be drained by making the man's foot enter hot water and leave until it empties out, which is a mistake in removing blood with removal on the first try.
Proceed slightly upward, the position is safe and does not cause herniation if you have preserved the nerve as we mentioned, and likewise do with the suture in a man other than this. As for the female'pressure, it can be done as we mentioned at the bend on the wild side.
It is beneficial to treat the ankle if it has been caused by hot blood, and how to remove so that pus enters the wound and accelerates and tightens the leg from below the ankle upwards with four long fine stitches as it does not appear except through this.
If this fistula appears, it may be either on a bend which is better or to close it with a thread or scratch a slit and its position is safe as seen in most people who disappear greatly since they did not find it.
The spontaneous fistula did not show any of its branches that appeared on the top part of the foot towards the pinkie and thumb, preserving nerves, and sending as much blood as you want.
Then remove the tightness and place a catgut on the fistula site, press it firmly as quickly healed.
Chapter Six and Nine.
In terms of size and how to use them.
The syringe may be made of horn, wood, copper or glass; one type is graduated and used for blood extraction while the other is unmeasured and not used for withdrawing fluids.
This non-graduated syringe is of two types.
The syringes for the throat from both sides, the ones for the jaw which are below the lower jaw, the ones for both shoulders under the armpits and the ones for the two arms in the middle of each arm. There are also syringes for the buttocks and those for both legs.
The syringe only attracts blood from the dilated veins in the muscles for this purpose it should not be dropped with force or used without fire when there are diseases of swelling until the body is completely emptied.
Indeed, the necessity of measurement arose from illness or beforehand; we used it at any time in the beginning of the month and later, as well as at mid-month and whenever necessary.
That is, there are those who, when blood abounds in their body to the point that they need to expel it by measurement, find heaviness and headache; some from them feel fullness and redness on their face, forehead, neck, chest, and arms, and some from them have pimples on their face and cheeks, darkening, and aversion in their eyes.
And there are some who laugh a lot, and others from them find the taste of blood in their mouths and throats swelling, bleeding gums; while others experience excessive sleepiness, seeing blood and redness during sleep along with wounds, surgeries, or something similar that we have seen.
Especially, in the middle third of the month regarding that issue by measurement after two hours or three have passed since noon, and as for the effectiveness of measuring pinpricks, it relieves heaviness in the head and water accumulation in the eyes.
However, it should be after cleaning the body; this size may serve as a substitute for gauze and he warns that if used by one with cold extremities or who has fainted, it can cause great harm.
Therefore, the elders should not use it if they have head ailments and are infirm or suffer from senility.
Therefore, the surgeon should instruct them to gently lower their hand a little downwards for fear of inducing amnesia; and gauze from the calf can serve as an alternative to thread or silk.
Therefore, it benefits from asthma and shortness of breath, obstruction of the respiratory apparatus, sneezing, and vomiting; gauze from the calf should be raised slightly if lowered as it can lead to weakening in the heart and stomach.
As for the gauze from the squid, it benefits from accidental head injuries and punctures, hernia, stroke, toothache in the roots of teeth; it can serve as an alternative to silk thread and the surgeon should instruct him not to deepen his grip with the clamp so that no vessel is cut.
As for the swelling under the chin, it is relieved by ear-piercing in the mouth and gum decay, as well as other diseases of the mouth; while the ganglion that is in the eyelids may be removed. And as for the size of the two jaws, they are relieved from swelling due to accumulation and heat.
As for the swelling of both sides of the sternum, it is relieved by removing the three slender veins and arteries because they draw blood from all those thin vessels in the muscles and attract those thin vessels from other thicker vessels until reaching the gravitational pull of the three main veins.
The swelling should not be punctured in the joint because it is red from the muscles and nerves underneath, while a single swelling on the elbow may benefit from draining abscesses and lower sores.
The swelling should be large and made of steel because the position requires strong forces, perhaps the glass syringe broke and tightened a lot, and there are deficiencies in both calf contractures.
Because it draws blood from the entire body and is beneficial for chronic ailments in the kidneys, testicles, bladamo, helps induce menstruation, treats hemorrhages and vomiting of blood, it completes the expulsion of pus from abscesses. However, it severely depletes the body and causes swelling in most people; confronting large amounts of these can be helpful near to the benefit derived from the quantity of two cups.
How to put on the compress: first, ensure that the compress is empty and fill it with lukewarm water. Do not overfill or extend beyond the edge of the compress; instead, apply it quickly and remove it swiftly so it can absorb into a level position. Repeat this process until you see that the location has turned red and opened up completely.
Redness of blood appeared at that time, intermittently reapply the compress quickly and then examine the skin; for those with swolebed meat in their pores, it should be compressed once without exception to make the spot ooze.
The nurse is instructed to widen the compress slightly, deepen it a bit, adjust it gently and move slowly; if the blood has thickened, it should be compressed twice - in the first instance to open up a passage for easy-flowing blood and fluid, and in the.
Indeed, the blood was greatly obstructed in reaching its endpoint for the third time, and to sum up, if we wish to remove a little bit of blood, then one incision suffices; but if we desire to remove much blood, two incisions are sufficient, and if we estimate that the blood is thick.
It was necessary to make a deep and moderate incision on the skin only, using either cauterization or water at the time of setting up an ambush, while cautioning the assailant; if his skin is thick, hardened, and has narrow pores.
It was necessary to cauterize the ambush positions with hot melted wax, or if in summer, use pine resin wax, amber wax, sweet almond oil wax, or castor oil wax.
And if in winter, use pitch wax, saffron wax, beeswax or lacquer; then the residue was thick and cold, so let it be pitch wax or mastic wax or pine resin wax or amber wax, etc.
Indeed, the accused with wide wounds should refrain from fat and they ought to wash themselves after defecation with red rose water or cold water or grape juice or cabbage water or barley water in a similar manner. As for one whose blood is abundant in moisture.
Wash the accused with barley water or asafetida and saffron in a similar manner, and if his lustfulness is profound wash him with aged wine or marjoram tea or boiled chickpeas or pomegnolia juice and so on, and he should be careful during defecation in the toilet and under its influence.
But it is proper to use after leaving the bathroom for an hour or two and one should not sleep after defecation, what should be used by the accused and guarded before and after defecation.
He should initially be assessed as lemon-colored and mostly blood rash, it is proper for the accused or guardian to take purgatives such as pomegranate and carob seeds with barley water and chickpeas and jalap and so on, and he should make his diarrheic foods like raisins and lamb kidneys porridge and liver meats in a similar manner.
He should have been given honey wine or maibuett, and moderate-aged aromatic wine between old and new, along with small portions of food such as larks' tongues, quail, chicken gizzards, and partridge, with the drink being more than the food on days of purging and defecation.
In some cases, it is appropriate to give certain individuals a laxative or antimony or chylothymia before purging and defecation or afterward to strengthen the main organs and thin the blood; however, they should not be given by charlatans.
For the organs that are unconditionally affected, such as the liver, gallbladder, and glands, as well as on the abdam and spleen and kidney points to bring blood from one part of the body to another; these parts do not have conditions but intend only to attract blood from one organ to another.
Placing the laxative on the glands or using it to dispel cold from an organ; if placed on the abdomen and spleen, it disperses the organ, warms it, and leads to painful dissolution of that coldness.
He placed it on the bladder if there is a stone or gravel, perhaps opening the stone or removing the gravel from its place; similarly, he did so with the liver and gall when they flutter in the wind - these attacks may be carried out empty-handed only using cotton.
He may have used fire or filled with soaked cotton in the anus; that to fill the cavity and become large by hot water alone, or by boiling water mixed with some herbs that work for this purpose.
Then he placed the plug at the spot and held, pulling repeatedly as needed; this is a picture of a cavity operated with fire.
Her mouth is shown as having two open fingers, about half a barleycorn deep and beside her there's a small hole on the order of allowing a needle to pass through it made from Chinese or yellow copper sheeting thickened at the edges.
A cloak with a lining of silk is irritating the part where it's placed and has a tube in its middle made from copper or iron for lighting up, and this cavity can be made larger than what we described, smaller according to diseases.
"The method of their reusable instruments is that the clubs for boys and eunuchs are not those for men, nor do livestprise. How to place this club on a limb with fire involves holding a lit fuse from a tube or a small piece of wax candle and placing it in the middle of the stiffened stick inside the club.
"The flame should rise up towards the bottom of the club so that it does not burn the body of the patient, then place on the bone and finger on the hole we mentioned until you can grip the club.
"The steam came out of that hole and loosened the club, then you lighted the fuse on its surface and returned it to you if you pulled at it, but there is no stiffened stick or hole in the club used for headache treatment with water.
"However, it is used to be filled with water and placed only on the bone, this is its image:" (followed by an image or illustration).
"This club was considered better when it was large enough to hold much water," (this would typically be followed by an image or illustration).
"The seventh and nineteenth section." This indicates the respective sections in a textbook on surgery, possibly referring to specific techniques or instruments discussed within those sections. (Again, this is typically followed by an image or illustration).
In the note on the vein.
However, the vein is mainly used in most cases for parts where it is not possible to place compresses, either because they are too small like the lips and gums or similar ones, or because the part is reddened by flesh as fingers, nose and suchlike.
The purpose of using the vein is from those that are in clear and pure water free of infecuity, then to leave it for a day and night in the freshwater until you drink and nothing remains inside it. Then the body is emptied first either by vomiting or by purging, and then the affected part is cleaned.
Until it turns red, and if the pustule is fallen then placed on it; If possible to compress with a compress it will be more benefcuous, otherwise wash the place with rose water then soak in plenty of water diluted with soft soap until foam forms, as bleeding continues after the fall of the vein like spraying from broken jugs into cold water.
Place it until the spray breaks, as blood has spread like a crushed material or abscesses similar to those from quills until bleeding stops or is placed on the spot with equal quantities of ground ointment.
Until the ligature reaches its place, the blood stops flowing; it is recommended to replace the ligature if possible and not use that one, so that a stopped ligature does not adhere, instead, cover the spot with spongy blood.
When the needle is inserted into place until blood comes out, then it should be placed if felt that something of the blood has adhered to the site; if desired to drop something on it, sprinkle with powder or salt or red ochre so that it falls onto the spot.

In surgery.
This section also treats what is needed in the field of medicine, including bone fractures and accidental amputations.
Be aware, O Son, that this section may be called absurd by physicians and laymen who have not skimmed or read a page of it from the surgeons.
Therefore, this science has become obsolete in our country and no one casts a thoughtful glance into it as long as I have not illuminated with it the learned man. Nevertheless, I have used it for as long as I have read and understood the ancient books and sought to comprehend them until I extracted that knowledge from them; then experience and practice were required over a lifetime.
"He drew for you in this section everything that I have written on the subject. "My experiences have been passed on to you after I brought them closer, condensed them from the populace, summarized them in a nutshell, made clear statements, and depicted for you many images of the tools used.
"So it is with increasing clarity as I have done in the previous sections, and no strength except for the great Allah.
The first section.
"In this section, I shall summarize and categorize the matter of breaking bones and present them before we start discussamofthe brokenanddisplaced parts, one by one. It is appropriate to mention here at the beginning with general statements and chapters. "You must first understand and stand on the truth of it, that you were eager to learn this noble profession.
"I say that when anyone breaks or dislocates or misplaces or falls, they should first hasten to set it right and relieve pain. "It is not that something like a weakness of strength or an event has prevented such as a boy, elder, extremely hot weather, or extreme cold.
Then he restricts himself to cold beverages, roasted meat and birds, avoiding alcohol, fatty meats, and overeating. All food that fills the veins with blood until the tumor is assured not to spread any further.
Then the patient should return to his initial treatment, if a broken bone is still in place, it was advised that the patient be fed foods rich and thick with substantial ingredients such as liver, rice, brains, kidneys, and ox tripe. And eggs, fatty fish and thick liquors such as these provisions will hasten the healing process to be faster and better, know that broken bones if they are in elderly men or old women may not reconnect or fuse as quickly as before.
For the fragility of their bones and if they have been connected or fused, it is as though from broken bones in young children but the nature of a healing process has emerged on all sides of the broken bone resembling something like thorny skin that clings to and tightens until some parts are forced together.
He binds one to another until it reaches the utmost strength and reliability, as it was originally intended, so that nothing hinders its actions.
For this reason, it is necessary to make the patient's food nutritious, robust, and dense as we have mentioned; be aware that different types of fractures vary according to the affected parts since a fracture of the leg bone differs from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone differs from a fracture of the backbone.
Likewise, all body parts differ from each other; hence we shall mention each type of fracture in its own detailed section separate from others, and the nature of a bone fracture may also vary within itself.
Because it may be a fragmented fracture not causing any splintering, or the fracture might run along the length of the bone with fragments and spikes present; alternatively, there could be fragments that are free (not attached) or non-free (still connected), as well as abrasions and lacerations to the skin in conjunction with a linear crack.
And for each type of fracture, its specific characteristics will be mentioned in detail at the point it is referenced; this identifies a bent bone fracture by its distortion and deformity visible to touch as well as its creaking sound when moved with fingers.
When there is no deformity or tumor, and the bone at the joint does not vibrate due to disturbance, and the disease is rarely painful with a fracture absent here but it may be a contusion, crack, or sprain that should not be moved excessively or massaged.
Carry a load on it after taking the medicine mentioned thereafter, once the position is agreed upon; gently restrain (the limb) with a light bandage and know that if the bone splits or diverges two inches apart without causing any cracks, then each part has entirely separated from its owner.
You should quickly proceed to set and bandage it from your side before an infection occurs; if the infection sets, plaster it for a few days until the hot swelling settles, then treat it with any appropriate remedies you deem suitable.
Know that fixing and bandaging this is easier than a bone where there are cracks, then gently restrain whatever has been mentioned to come; the bone was from two hands or two feet without any distortion of the broken part.
Either with your hand if the bone is small, or with two cords, or with a cord and your hand, place the bone in its natural position as far as possible until the fractured end of the bone extends again; then gently adjust those fragments to their places from all sides.
Ensure that your efforts do not cause pain or discomfort to the injured person, and ensure no bone touches another without you feeling quite sure it is in its best position; at this time, you should feel and assess them with your hand as much as possible, and correct any abnormality you may find within your capabilities.
Be very cautious and gentle with your efforts, as many inexperienced individuals often do incorrectly and cause severe damage or burns to the bone due to their actions. In some cases, you may have seen such injuries occur by mistake before.
After the realignment and immobilization, ensure that bone remains still and motionless; advise the patient not to move it during alertness or sleep and during any transition, disturbance, or coughing episodes, making sure all movements are minimal so as not to compromise the stability of the bone.
That is, when I feel that a limb has pain or discomfort, it transfers to another limb where there is no sensation of pain and hurts along with that so that the positioning remains straight.
Without causing distortion in the limb if broken, and how a broken limb is strained as I have described to you, know that fractured parts differ depending on whether they are small like arms or fingers, and their thicknesses from those of a young person such as elbows.
It was required that the flaps of a tear and hinge be as smooth as skin, with thicknesses such as thighs, backs, and chests being firm so that the flat edges require stiffness because loose tissue requires the large limb to contract from all sides equally without any imbalance.
Then begin after your rest period with the agreed-up cupping treatment. Start with a gentle massage on the fracture site, then begin wrapping the suture at the same fracture site in three or four wraps depending on what the limb deserves and slightly tighten your hand with the thread thereafter, proceeding to the upper side of the fracture site.
Apply less tension than the fracture site, then gently separate it from the edge of the break slightly and ease off on the pressure a little until you take hold of the correct position with something suitable, then use another set to twist it as well at the broken place.
Roll and go to the lower side of the fracture, then in rolling you make it with the tension we mentioned at the first upper roll; then put between the rolled leaves a flexible splint or bandage as much as needed for the displacement of the break.
If there is displacement, do not make anything in it, then use another set to twist it and then smooth out on these rolls from your hour if the bone does not swell or become red-hot.
If there is swelling or a hot spot, feel it and then let the inflammation for days, then tighten with the rolls when it's time; and that the rolls are one-quarter of the thickness of cut pine logs skillfully prepared or made from ravenwood.
Those who are made from willow, or reed leaves, or flax fiber, and similar forms to those depicted here and this style with his eyes.
Except that the stitches placed on the wound itself are slightly thicker and more prominent than those of the others, and as for making a stitch, it should be according to what fits the broken piece from the largest to the smallest part, image of the stitch:.
Then hold the stitches with another bundle according to his first tension in his eyes, then tie them up on top of the tightened threads as we have mentioned from the tension and that his tension be greater than the location of the fracture. And after speaking about the wound, its tension was lesser.
The threads should be of medium thickness and fineness so that they are from the wet wool, because if the threads were like what is seen in unskilled work making their threads from folded cloth strips, it would be a great mistake.
Because it is tensioned too far from balance and the thin threads also do not hold well because you do not achieve the desired tension, nor should there be less between stitches than fingers' width.
In cases where a wound is caused by thorns after proper pressure, make it with a flexible bandage or stretched cloth so that nothing further injures from there onwards; and if the break occurred with a cut skin causing a rupture in the skin, we will address this separately.
Be aware that not every broken bone should be bound with bandages from the first day and if it is a large one, it should not be placed under bandages except after five or seven days or more depending on your assessment of heat causing inflammation.
This is the general term for bandages that oblige broken bones, fractures, and swellings to be placed on top of them; this type of bandage should heal more quickly and especially suits boys and girls as it does not get too hot or cold.
It is to take flour dust and apply it on the creases of the knees during grinding movement, as if you were not to cover with egg white so that it does not become too thick or fine but moderately roughened.
Title: Dressing for Laceration, Chip and Impact Wounds Using Materials such as Sheep's Gut, Silk Thread, Cockle Shell Paste, Catgut, Linen, and Other Substances, Including Twelve Drams of Plaster from Each Item, Five Drams Mixed with Ointment per Unit for Layers, and Twenty-Two Drams of Clay or Roman Clay. All are mixed and kneaded with white of egg or milk if the condition is tender, then this dressing is used as it has excellent adhesion to quickly mend broken bones and heal for more people.
Another dressing that also works for fractures and lacerations, takes catgut, sheep gut, and white thread from each item, with twelve drams mixed with ointment per unit, five drams of cockle shell paste per one, twenty-two drams of Roman clay; all are kneaded gently, strained, processed with water or egg whites.
Dressing for joints and bones out of place that soothes their pain, unlocks misaligned bones, and fractures; it takes boiled cotton and strained oil and is applied to the location; this dresser does not have a forceful adhesive.
However, it is superior in soothing the inflamed tumor and relieving ailments, another kind of plaster that forces the broken bone must take mute vine leaves and pure flaxseed and pound them all together and apply with both wet. Another brief plaster used when setting a fractured bbean
To analyze the remainder of the tumor, take from each original mummy: musk, frankincense, myrrh powder and gum arabic in equal parts grind them all together and apply with plaster if not naturally detached then force it off using azarcon or vinegar water.
Another stronger plaster used in this analysis, when a solid tumor occurs upon fracturing the bone: take from each original mummy musk, almonds, honey and saffron, myrrh, gum arabic - one part of each.
Grind them all together and apply with vinegar water or distilled water, or use plaster according to the temperature and movement of the bone; as for the thickening which is not mentioned in his book, he does not put it on the broken bone when setting it.
The only keryatas that are made from wax and oil, which have not been described as being between pliable and soft; Galen saw [to be applied] on the broken bone when things like a substance with heat similar to pitch, resin, and milk were used.
A poultice that is effective for thinness and pain, takes camphor, soapwort, human hair or bird feather, eggshells, and equal parts of crushed, leached, kneaded, and applied with it; and the amount that should remain tied together.
Then it is considered that if the illness, pain, and displacement of the bone did not occur at its place for many days but occurred in its position then there was an intense spasm or severe pain or bloating.
In the case of his falcon and there is no delay with that time, remove the poultcuge from it; then take a soft pumice or cotton soaked in wet oil and wash the place until the inflammation settles and the pain subsides, then leave the bone to rest for an hour.
Then, the patient carries a soaked wool in vinegar or rose oil and ties it overnight to secure the hot tumor and allow the limb to rest and cool down. The bandage is then gently returned to its original position with a running compress that should not be tightened too much.
Then, gently remove it until healed; I observed that the tumor, redness, pain, swelling, and all symptoms had gone away and returned to the bandage and pressure dressing as done originally, nothing unusual occurred in the limb except what we mentioned earlier.
It should not be removed except after three or four or five days, or seven at most, based on what you see with the condition of the limb as we mentioned until it is necessary to break and cut away the scar tissue if accumulated.
It was also tighter than the initial pressure and increased the patient's diet based on what is provided; I saw that the location of the cut had dried out and shrunk more than it should, so be aware that the food intake has been restricted.
"Dissolve Fontanelle with water regularly, do this for three days and reduce the tightness a bit; by doing so, the bone receives nourishment and heals quickly. As for what is created by foolish forceps from breaking the bone again.
"If they do not act as they should and instead force a bend, it is their fault and greatly misguided; even if the ancients wrote about it and practiced it, I saw someone's work on this be affected negatively. "And indeed, it is true that it does not work with him," [Arabic]
"Chapter Two." [Audience Response: This could be the title of a section or chapter in the textbook.]
"In cases of false swelling on the head," [Audience Response: This appears to be an indication that the following content pertains to handling issues related to a false bulge or abnormal growth in the skull region.]
"There are many types of false fractures in the head, with various forms and complex causes; it may result from a sword blow where all the bone heals to form an ossified union beneath the bone." [Audience Response: This segment elaborates on different kinds of deceptive skull fractures, their appearances, etiologies, and specific outcomes like complete bone healing underneath.] "As a splint does in wood," [Audience Response: This is likely a metaphor comparing the process described for skull fractures to how a splint supports and guides the healing of wood, implying structural support.]
Therefore, this type of fracture is called Comminuted and it may be a cut in the sword or bone fragments only with its face not further divided and they call this type of fracture a complete dislocation, and these two types of fractures are either large or small.
And it is a fracture that may be hollow or accepted, and the reason for it is being hit by a stone or falling on a stone or near it, and this faster may either have broken through the membrane underneath the bone or may be in the face of the bone.
And these two types of fractures are also either large or small, and it is a fracture that may be hidden in the bone at the hair layer which is an extension crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called Hairline, and it is a cut that from falling or hitting a stone near to enter the bone layer into and settle at a weakened spot as if copper is shown exposed if hit by an ingress entering part of it inside.
And more, it is in the wet bone of children's skulls as pebbles and all these types of fractures may have detached or non-detached shards and we will come to mention treating all that in its place, and we identify all these types by uncovering them.
Her examination with palpation and removal of putrefied meat from it, and as for the type that is known by reaching the bone and wiping and staining it with dye, the fracture appears black; and as for treating the fracture, first look at the symptoms of the illness.
I saw from its symptoms an indication of a condition suggestive of fear such as sweating, swelling, fainting, loss of voice, paralysis, severe nausea, eye watering and redness, similar to these symptps the disease cannot be approached or treated, only death will occur with this condition.
And if I see symptoms that do not worry or frighten me then take it in treatment and that is that the injured one was injured at first during winter days.
It was necessary to remove the bone fragment before the fourteenth day in all cases, and if it was during summer days then hasten removing the bebone fragment before the seventeenth day so that what is underneath the bone does not become infected presenting those symptoms which we described.
Indeed, the fracture of the bone reached the covered membrane over the brain, and it was with a hematoma that it should be cut where the bruised part is pressed upon as I described to you before: that the head of the injured party curls upward.
The bone is exposed on the face or as per the shape of the wound and depending on what is hidden in the injured, your display when the bangle exposes blood flow or a hot abscess as appropriate.
It is to cover the place of incision with a bandage, oil and ointment so that the abscess can settle and contain the bleeding; then you take it out by breaking and extracting the bone, which would be on one of two sides of the face.
As for the one face, it is to cut the bone with a narrow slit incision like this:.
Then another incision is used after this one, slightly exposing it as follows:.
Then another incision is used, which also exposes it from the secondary one and should have several different incisions with some being exposed from each other and others shorter than each other and to be at most of their ends made of good steel or copper.
He used his assistant in the strike to ensure that nothing would shake the head, as the bone was strong and solid; it should be drilled around it before using your trepan with non-serrated drills that had serrations.
Because it does not exceed the skull bone beyond to allow the drill to have a curved edge on what is below without its pointed end, resembling a hook or small circle that prevents it from sinking and exceeding the jawbone.
You should have multiple of these drills repaired to the extent of that jawbone until it reaches each trepan, one with a sharp edge in length and shortness corresponding to that of the jnail bone; this is an image of three types. From large, medium, and small drills:.
And how to trepan around the broken bone is for you to make a hole in the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bnail has gone, then move the drill to another position and create space as close to its density or towards it.
Then cut out the segments between each of the two holes and do so as much as you can with your hands, as we have said, until you remove the bone either by hand or another tool that has been made for this purpose.
Like a pouch and fine threads, be sure to handle the stitch and cut very carefully so as not to damage any of the sutures if you have to break or remove the bone that is attached by them, it should then be extracted cleanly.
And smooth any rough parts of the bone left using a tool similar to an osteotome, but it should be slimmer and finer than other cutters; small pieces and splinters should then be gently taken with whatever tools are available to you.
Then treat the wound with stitches and dressings as indicated, while the other aspect of work is easily done away from the furrow mentioned by Galen, whom he praised greatly - that's what was said. First, you should start by exposing the part of the bone where the break is most severe and old until that piece has revealed the side through which the osteotome passed, here are its images:.
The convex part of it is uncut and the sharp part is on the edges in length, as seen to be convex for the section to resemble a saqafa (scaffold) and the cut edge on the bone then strike on the cut from one side.
With a small mallet until all bones are cut neatly as they rotate and you within the safety of an enclosure where no mishap occurs from fear or ignorance, even if the handler is unknown to them, but he obeps them yes, even if it were Nausicaa.
It remains that something must be removed from the bone in certain positions of the bangs, scrape it off by the convex part itself and dispose of it gently as it releases without harm or fear.
And if the bone crack did not reach into the enclosure and what broke off from the bone is exposed, with remaining fragments still being sharp and thin edges, one should scrape away that sharpness and remove those fine shards with a splinter gauge which has taken several different sizes so you can use them in any position or fix it as required by your work.
With the same broken bone and its shape, one should first use it in the outer layer for that fracture before using a finer one; continue doing so until you reach the most refined and softest version of all.
As for the small scalp cuts and the gentle fracture, each should be treated individually according to what leads to its effectiveness; this is something that cannot be hidden from someone skilled in this craft as we have written and stated in our section on major fractures.
When the membrane is exposed after your bone removal, it should take two cuts up to the level of the wound and immerse them in red lead oil before placing them on the face of the wound; then take another pair or triangular cuts. Immerse them in wine and red lead oil, place them on the first cuts, then cover them as thinly as possible so that it does not burden the gap at all; from there, use flat or broad strips but only to a degree that just holds the wound.
Keep it with this treatment for a day or two until the abscess heals, then dissolve and use after that the drugs which accompany it like ivy stems and almond flour, quince seeds, candied ginger, etc., making the mentioned drug as best as you can.
The excerpt has been translated as follows: "Applied to the wound as it was dry, and in essence, a medicine used so that it heals without causing pain. Scrub with effort when treating the wound to ensure cleanliness, free from grease, filth, and preventing any accumulation of pus.
"If a swelling accumulangs on the scalp, it will destroy and infect it leading to a severe illness; this can be seen at the forehead when the bone is exposed or especially if its treatment is neglected.
"The rash seen on its surface suggests the symptoms of the illness we have mentioned, and it is certain that there is no cure for them; the pigmentation only occurred due to a medicine being placed upon it and by the potency of that drug causing such pigmentation.
"It is advisable to take a part of honey and one-third of rose oil, beat them well together, dab the mixture on gauze then apply it to the scalp and treat with the types of remedies that should be used until healed.
"The third lesson.
In cases where the nose is broken.
It should be known that the nose does not break except from its upper part, all of it or one of them, because they are bones and below it is cartilage which cannot break but only shows redness, swelling, and blistering.
In case one of the breaks enters, it is proper to insert a small finger into the nostril hole and smooth that broken piece from inside with your little finger until the nose returns to its natural shape; do this gently so as not to cause further damage or pain to the patient.
If the break is in the upper part of the nose and cannot be reached by a finger, it should be treated similarly to such breaks; one must address fractures on both sides immediately after they occur.
If not possible within the seventh or tenth day of an abscess heating, then insert two threads into the nostril hole if there is a break on one side or thread pieces from both sides if breaks are present on both sides.
Make the thread thick enough to fill the nostril hole, and some of the ancients advise soaking the thread in fat and changing it daily; however, I do not suggest this but rather recommend immersing the thread in lamb's marrow.
Then the pus is left until the bone is confirmed and the fibrous tissue solidifies, and pipes made of ivory are inserted into its place in the nose after a slight puncture, which prevents further nasal ruptures and helps prevent breathing problems due to the illness.
This is not necessary if you have made or concocted the ointment, but during your work and inflammaturin of the nose, apply it with cotton soaked in rose oil or a lump submerged in an oil-filled vial or some other substance from the balm.
Rubbing warming innajah (a type of ointment) should not be applied from outside mead and powdered quince that have been kneaded with egg white, then place a soft thread on it without tying the nose to anything, as nasal bones may crack into small fractures.
Or it may be that she needs to be scraped and extracted using the appropriate instrument for healing, then suture the wound and treat with ointments as prescribed by compatible liniments, causing an internal nose injury should be treated with pus and use metal pipes. Until he is cured.
Section Four.
The nail below should be fractured.
If the nail below is fractured but not torn with a visible wound, it was only chipped and did not break into two pieces; if it has become brittle inside then its condition needs to be examined closely.
It is advisabel for the right thumb to enter the mouth of the ailment on the right side and also if the break is on the left side then the little finger from the right hand should go in, raising the broken piece from inside out.
The other hand from outside the bone should control its setting, if the fracture of the jaw has broken into two then both ends must be used to stabilize until it can be set properly, as a displacement in the teeth may have occurred.
Or if the splint does not want to stay with a gold or silver wire, then place it on the broken nail using a string and put a double ligature over it, followed by placing an elongated needle underneath and securing another piece of skin-tight leather equal in length to the nail. Then it is fastened on top, according to what you consider suitable for its binding and consent; ensure it remains intact until ordered by the illness to abstain from eating and keep calm, making the food porridge soft. I thought that something might have changed in appearance, specifically related to facial features, as he resolved it on the third day.
Then it is fastened on top, according to what you consider suitable for its binding and consent; ensure it remains intact until ordered by the illness to abstain from eating and keep calm, making the food porridge soft. I thought that something might have changed in appearance, specifically related to facial features, as he resolved it on the third day. Then, what you dress it with sheep's fat or wheat starch paste after removing the old bandage, place a soft padding on the dressing, and let that bandage remain applied without any change in swelling of the bone.
Do not remove it until the wound is healed and this sore becomes firm within three weeks, during which period a warm spice mixture that we mentioned should be used for soothing until that tumor goes away.
And if the sore is accompanied by an exposed bone shard or fragments protruding out, you should remove them with a tool as agreed upon; then enlarge the wound opening enough to accommodate your fistula plug.
Then if those splinters are removed and there is nothing left from the wound, it should be considered wide, otherwise one of the leather gloves must be worn so that it can heal for this reason. The wound shall be filled until it is clear.
Chapter Five.
It should strengthen the sutures if they are broken.
More than what breaks the sutures from three quarters of the incision edge and breaks it on one side, either they break or divide into two without causing splinters, which is easier to mend.
Or if it is with a cut causing splinters, then the work in that case where the cut is not from the wound involves two pegs to adjust the broken sutures and one to extend the incision towards the other side.
Then adjust the cut with your fingers until it takes the right shape without cracks or flaws, and apply more padding under the bandage as needed using a piece of gauze or fabric.
The bone should be adjusted to the extent needed and stretch and raise the sutures, pressing the pad with your hand until the cut heals properly; if you cannot pull one end of the suture outward for it to sink deep enough that the wound can drain by itself, then please continue.
He placed under the tip a medium-sized cushion in the bone, and the assistant pressed down on the base until the fracture extending to the deeper part was lifted upwards. Then he fixed the break with your fingers.
I felt that the fracture from the condyle had moved and it was necessary to scratch at it so as to remove that chip, but since the chip was embedded in the bone, he removed a piece of it with precision by one of its segments, which had multiple divisions therefor. After the condyle apparatus that saves the joint was invented, it was a device made of wood or iron and appeared as follows:
It resembles a spoon without any rim, and its size is according to how much bone you need from larger or smaller ones, and as for the length of it, it depends also on what work can be done with it, so that each end appears wider or narrower as seen in one end being wider or the other.
It was a cut in the wound that I had removed for the bone chip being wide, and the hot boil intensified gathering your suture with stitches, if it were to advance slowly or fear of the hot boerhaavia increasingly invading the wound through laceration.
In the case of a suppurating furuncle that bursts through the skin into olive oil, vineger, or wine, and a splinter is embedded in it if there is no wound or opening, then it should be applied to the bone with an adhesive plaster made from the dust of caterpillar's dung mixed with chalk. The flexible bandage is then applied over it, and a large roller gauze is placed with the length exposing slightly to the incision if necessary, followed by carrying two adhesive plasters on the strain and the dressing. Then take a needle from silk thread. It has three fingers in length and is likewise inserted into the slit, then inserted that slit with the needle, and place it alongside the gauze with the needle at the position of the adhesive plaster where the incision lies; then wrap the bandage around the incision as you would wind. And the veil on his neck and undernee proper incision, as well as under the patient's nipple; repeat this several times in all directions so that you see tightening of the incision to firmly secure it.
And ensure that the needle does not slip off the broken bone. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the patient every day. Once the ligature has rested and you have seen that the roots are gone, tighten the ligature and make the wound on top of its head, then at night undernecuce tighten a small bandage.
His sinew grew up on either side, as did the fracture healing above the forearm, and do not loosen the ligature if no accident occurred from an incision or ulcer in twelve days.
Then change the bandage if you see it is for that reason. He returned to the strain and left it until the fracture consolidated, then became more pronounced in eighty-two days than that. And it may be less in some people.
The sixth chapter.
A fracture of the mandible occurs. Do not say that it has cracked from an exposed place, but only from its joints, whenever a tooth or middle region is fractured and this is known by touching according to the shape of the frozne.
Fix it in its natural shape using all possible means, then place it on the spot with flour from egg whites and thin strips of linen, and put a plate made of two joined plates above it.
Gently stretch it to the length of its whole arm or slightly longer, then slowly pull the thin strips of linen from underneath until the bandage reaches a level position and tie it with a long wrap.
Tighten the bandage securepressure and document it from underneath the bandage until its position is lost, inspect the wrap daily when relaxed and tighten it again if it comes off its place, and press the wound on both sides of the bone if fractured in 20.
If after five and twenty days the bandaging is completed and you are sure that there is no fracture in the bone, then a small piece of bone may protrude and sink under the skin; pull it out gently from beneath the skin. And create what has been mentioned in the previous section regarding extracting a hot tumor, if such occurs.
Section Seven.
Surgery of the chest cut.
The chest may rupture in the middle and slightly show this, while its edges are more likely to rupture and bleed; as for its symptoms if it ruptures in the middle, it leans downward and shows a severe pain and difficulty breathing.
And sometimes it may be found with bleeding and the fracture is obvious to the touch; he must lift the illness onto its back and become between his shoulders, then encircle the nipple on both sides with his hands and bring together the arms and tighten around it as much as possible.
And it should be left until the bone returns to its shape, then carry a pad and splint on it, or use linen strips or bandages in line with it over the skin after having injured it through perforation. Then tighten the bandage on the broken bone so that it does not slip, and keep the tensioned bandage turning toward his back several times, then check the bandage at each time, and as soon as he rests a little harder.
If necessity requires solving it when a wound is exposed, or painful, or swoleby performing the closure and removing the suture and repairing what was caused by this in order to treat it then replacing the suture if you deem necessary. The method must be applied until it is completely healed.
The eighth section.
The bones must be fixed if they are broken, as the fracture is only in them at the sites of protection and their backs and edges which have healed for it to become a callus so that knowledge of this does not escape by touch upon examination.
They must be fixed so that the fracture is aligned using fingers until it takes the proper shape, then bandage and splint the broken bone if necessary; as a fractured bone tends to incline inward which presents with severe pain.
The eighth is like the first one presented by those for the bone to incline in order that it may be protected and also present with difficulty breathing, sneezing, frequent bleeding which complicates treatment; as the extremities have often turned severe.
"One of them said that it is necessary to make the food of the patient cause expansion through heat and wind, so that the abdomen expands and contracts, pushing the defect outward; we call this an indication for occurring a suppurative tumor if it did not happen then it has happened.
"Some of them said that after placing the tumor and squeezeing it strongly, except for measuring, as they fear that the swelling would be drawn towards the position due to weakness of the place; some of them said that it should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
"If the abscess forms between the limbs and fills up to level of the joint, then treat the ailment with dietary therapy and medicines after binding it around; if you exhaust the patient, this is an extremely difficult matter not to endure. "The bone is the least damaged and we fear for the ailment to be opened at the place, then revealed the broken limb and replaced by an apparatus that preserves the membrane as described, with gentle care of removing the bone.
Then we gather the lobe of the wound if large, using sutures and treat it with a bandage until healed; during this time, apply hot compresses, bind with bulrush leaves in rose oil on the fat, place at the location, and treat the illness by removing the tumor from inside.
He is covered on the side he sleeps until healed.
Chapter Nine.
It's necessary to puncture the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck if fractured and dislocated, present it to someone who can recognize whether he has recovered or not, as well as spinal injuries if that is presented to anyone. I observed that his hands appeared to have fallen asleep and become numb, and died, unable to move them or bend their fingers and grab with them; if pierced or pricked with a needle he did not feel it, nor found pain in them, so I understand that he is very likely not recovered.
If they can move them and feel the pricking and piercing, I know that the bone marrow has healed and the illness is recovering; if it's a back fracture similar to this, I want to know whether he also recovers or not.
Note: Considering the man, I noticed that both of them had relaxed and what happened in their hands occurred; then if he lay on his back, the wind and sweat escaped involuntarily, and if it fell on his abdomen, urine escaped involuntarily. If it fell on his back and he wanted to urinate but couldn't, understand that this is due to no treatment; nothing from the previous step was enough, so the matter became worse, treat what happened as a means of calming down the abscessed sore.
Place olive oil on the affected joint alone or with boiled egg whites, apply it three times a day until the hot abscess cools down and take one of the strong compresses (dry), wrap it around and bind it tightly, instruct him to rest and calm down.
He should not sleep unless pain-free, as there may have been a fracture in the bone or something that might need to be dislodged; it would then require him to scrape off the skin and extract the affected bone. Then, the surgeon collects a large wound with suture and treats it with tourniquangs to stop bleeding until healed; the other part of the humerus shaft breaks and is fractured, which requires inserting the hyomandibular from the left hand into the notch.
And the fractured bone is set by the other hand as best as possible, then supported with a splint and plaster if necessary, then tightened.
I felt a slightly fractured bone in it, which was dislocated and removed, and treated the wound with medication as needed until healed,.
Chapter X.
Surgical treatment of femur fractures.
It is said that femur fractures can occur as a result of being broken, and the severity may cause them to flake off at the ends, crack along their length, tend towards infection, show signs of inflammation, and radiate pain down to the shin where the break occurred.
And to treat him, he must pass his hand over the fracture until it is aligned as close as possible according to what you consider appropriate for setting; make it resemble its original shape.
Indeed, the fracture is in length or has pierced to the inside of the ailment on its belly until it appears ripe for treatment; if closed, then cover with bandages and apply pressure using wooden or leather splints.
Do not fear the displacement of the fracture or the loss of splints; let the depression heal until it can bear weight and instruct the injury to rest, either on its back or on its correct side, with a hot compressor presented.
Release the bandage and splints until the hot compressor cools down, then place on it what provides warmth; return to the splinting and tighten as necessary, presenting bone fragments or edges that should not be removed.
And do not exceed as we said, but leave it tightened until healed.
The Surgical Section Ten.
In the treatment of bone fracture.
The clavicle is a bone connecting to the head of the shoulder; if fractured at either end, it will take on an arched and concave shape as depicted in this image:.
He connects two straps on its sides and hangs it from a high place, then the patient sits on a chair with the broken arm placed upon it until the cast is fixed in the middle of the bend, then it is hung again from above.
He extends it to the patient downwards, then the physician aligns the fractured hands together until he sets them correctly; and the other way is for the patient to be lifted by his feet so that their arms hang from their neck with straps.
Then two attendants are ordered to adjust one above the fracture with their hands and the other below, each extending in opposite directions; if they wish for a stronger pull under the fracture, they strap it from below and extend each attendant towards themselves.
It was necessary for the strap underne.
Then the fracture was brought together gently until it sat properly and formed a good union, then it is bandaged if no redness appears, but if there is hot swelling put it in a tightly bound compress with vinegar soaked wool until the seventh day, when apply ointment.
Until the tumor has penetrated, then extract it, and apply a dressing on the wound, then apply a new gauze over the dresspressure bandage, then gather your arm around itself and place an open hand upon its bend.
Carry the bandage and pressure on your arm, so that you may set the joints if it has not prevented you from doing so or changed in terms of broken bones, but if there is a change due to this condition then proceed with setting the fracture.
It is to place on the wound itself, joints that are more prominent and stronger than other joints in the body, making sure there is a finger's width between each joint so that the length of the fractures corresponds to the size of the wound with an increase by three fingers from both sides.
Then apply a pressure on the fractures with the bandage mentioned in the first chapter.
And your bandage should be tighter than the position of the wound.
And after the fracture has healed, and if your bandage is less tight as we stated earlier, you can set the joints in your limb for an hour or so.
If you fear the heated tumor has spread, tighten the bandage and use ligatures for seven days as we previously mentioned. Then examine the suture daily for three days to ensure there is no swelling or inflammamoents at the site; if the patient refrains from eating for this period, it will all be healed accordingly.
I am confident that nothing of the sort will occur; therefore, do not remove the bandage until after many days and place a filled gauze on the bulge on his head, back, and below the joint.
Check at all times, day or night, to ensure the shape of the injured limb does not loosen again or that the bandage becomes loose; resolve it entirely with your efforts. Place the patient's food on the tray we provided so that initially it is mild until their bones strengthen.
It should be gradually increased, as the hump and thigh usually harden in forty days; at that time it is appropriate to remove the bandage, use soap, and treat with the pads provided until completely healed, so that the fissure was a closed one.
Do not tie the bandage for fifty days or two months,
Section Twelve.
In cases of arm fractures.
The forearm is fractured in two bones, called the radius and ulna; one of them being small (ulna) which extends to the wrist, while the other is larger (radius) situated underneath the smaller from below. If only the large breaks, or if only the small does so, it may also break simultaneously.
If the small bone breaks at its upper part, the fracture is easy to set and heal quickly; but if the lower one (radius) breaks, then it is a poorly set fracture with slow healing and hardening. If both bones break simultaneously, then the smaller of the two will be the broken radius.
It is for the physician, when setting the fracture, to lengthen it slowly until it heals; if the large bone (ulna) is broken, then it should be set more tightly; and if both are broken, then the limb's tension must be very strong.
The hand should be placed in a shape while setting the fracture, with an extended limb on a bed and thumb raised above all fingers; while the nail is below the rest of the nails and the splint should be squarely placed against it.
The bed should be placed at a height so that the patient does not have to strain themselves.
Then the surgeon extends one forearm from below, either with his hand or with a splint, and another assistant stretches their arm upwards over it, so that the doctor can best reshape the bone shards caused by the fracture.
Each bone fragment placed in its position, you noticed another free fragment protruding from it. The skin around it was swolculed and not tender to touch near the fracture; it could be pulled out and gently removed as per the method described earlier. It appears that there is a fracture with an open wound, exposing one edge of the bone.
This was treated using a method where the fracture site is exposed and an infected wound that has been sutured with a tough cord soaked in rose oil and white wax should be cleansed with a mix of turpentine and alcohol, then tightly but gently bandaged until the swelling subsides.
Remove the cord and apply a newly made bandage mixed with tamarind powder, including egg whites; then take gauze pads to place on the fracture site itself that will be slightly exposed but stronger, knowing that in most cases there are six or more splints used for the arm.
The piece was in one or two segments together, then make your grip on the location of the fracture stronger and tighter, as it reached with the tightening upwards or downwards slightly more than what is mentioned at the beginning of the first chapter.
The fracture that was damaged on the break should be moistened and not too hard, and the thread used to tighten from a special medium between silkiness and thickness as we described earlier, with the tendon and ligaments being examined after some days.
Something that needs to be fixed, like a sore exposed in the tendon, should be immersed in warm water until the sore is absorbed and the tendon remains untightened for one night so it can rest before being tightened again.
The tightening may have relaxed and the bone may be approaching that state; therefore, fix it all with your effort. Also, consider that it is appropriate for the nutrition to allow some time before being applied too tightly, let it rest a little and leave it days until food flow can resume then tighten it again.
There is nothing that the patient exhibited as we mentioned should not be untightened except after twenty days or so, then instruct their hand towards their neck and let their arm remain relaxed and avoid excessive movements while they rest in a sitting position.
Know that this section of the arm is joined in thirty days or in twenty-three and thirty, and perhaps it may be joined in eighty-twenty days, all depending on cases of suppuration and strength conditions.
The Third Eleventh Chapter.
In the fracture of hand and fingers section.
The skin and fingertips' safety show less exposure to the fracture or often much more exposure to healing, whenever the hand shows a fracture or healing.
The patient should be seated upright with a chair in front of him on an elevation.
Then he places his hand stretched out and extends the bone splint for the doctor to cover it until a good union occurs, then it should be carried by sutures and stitches if no infection has occurred, then carry a splint over the affected area as much as possible.
It has been included in a soft bandage, as the fracture was towards the palm of the hand forming an almost spherical shape from the gauze and the patient is ordered to hold it with his broken hand then tighten the long bandage.
And let the fistula be from skin that is somewhat flexible, to bend the skin with spreading all fingers and pressing it as needed; so that the cut went outwards in such a way that one fistula should come above another below on the palm, making the hand open flat.
Then the pressure is carried as the hand turns and is tied between fingers by ties, so that the cut's edge reaches one of the fistulae in a way that the thumb should not be placed where it should but rather pressed with the palm, if desired to make a small flat cleft for closing the incision.
And the cut along all fingers is like the middle, index, little or ring finger and does not extend to them but connects with the finger that follows correctly, or ties all together on loyalty, which is better or places a small flat cleft upon it.
As we said about the thumb and examining it in case of a fistula or after an inflamed area that is suitable, whenever something occurs from it repeatedly as described. (Note: This last part seems to be incomplete; it likely refers to further steps or consideramoents within the surgical procedure.)
Chapter Fourteen.
In the case of a leg fracture.
The thigh bone often breaks and can be felt because it moves towards the back and away from the fracture; in such cases, a cast should be applied above the break and another below it, with the patient being placed on bed rest.
Then each cast should be extended towards the center of its respective bone if the fracture is in the middle of the thigh, and a more flexible cast made from wool or similar material should be used near the origin of the leg.
At the origin of the leg, where it turns towards the side, extend the cast upward and the other cast downwards if the fracture is near the knee; likewise, make the cast close to the joints for a fracture near the knee so that it extends downward. Finally, the physician should gently mold the bone with his hands until he restores its natural shape.
A well-united bone should be bound and supported if no tissue has been damaged, or a warm poultice is applied if it becomes inflamed; the poultice must be left on for several days until the area heats up, after which treatment can resume.
As for wrapping it, it is preferable to cover the wound with a firm and wide bandage twice or three times, leaving only what is necessary from it. Then wrap the leg until the ankle reaches the origin of the Achilles tendon and insert a long thread between the calf and thigh near the knee from below, allowing both ends of the thread to protrude upwards.
Then handle the shin and calf, leaving only what is necessary from the bandage, then on the location of the cut make a single incision along the tibia bone in the leg, then sew up any gaps between the calf and thigh with fine stitches to close.
Then start applying strong pressure from the middle of the incision for three or four turns and tie it off at the cut site so that the hold is looser and more flexible.
Then thread the needle that you inserted between the calf and thigh, tie it off with more stitches above it, then pass the other end of the thread downwards until reaching the heel of the foot and also secure both ends of the sutures on the opposite side of the stitches.
Unless the sutures are removed from their position, then leaving the tightness on it as long as there is no speaking or swelling or blowing in this manner causes something to happen immediately, and they can rectify and heal everything that has happened in this manner as we have mentioned above.
There was a fracture in the bone that should be smoothed out if possible, otherwise extract it and remove it and treat the wound as you have suggested until healing occurs; this fracture of the shin may not spread to the leg without using plasters.
As we have mentioned in the arm and elbow, this type of fracture does not lead to paralysis when accompanied by a limp; if it is fractured only on one side without causing the leg to join with it, it will never cause its owner to become permanently lame.
Be aware that the shin will harden in fifty days or increase slightly or decrease slightly, depending on differences in humors and other conditions,.
The fifteenth chapter.
In a fracture of the femur.
The femur presents less exposure to fractures and may present with more relief, if there is a fracture then it will be either an open fracture or closed but incomplete, accompanied by wounds and non-wounded areas.
She stands by it with her sense, and compels them to settle what she separates from parts of it with her fingers until they come together and become deformed according to how the reconchemption and agreement can be achieved, then she takes the swab and applies a round suture if necessary.
She then tightens the agreed upon grip, and all conditions described above in this section such as the hot tumor and its approach shall meet each other accordingly to achieve a healing state that leads to recovery.
Chapter Sixteen.
In fracture of the leg.
The leg has two bones, one is called the thighbone and is thick; the other is thin and called Shaft and presents various types of fractures to them. Therefore, its fracture is the same as that of the arm: whether it is a simple or compound fracture, both bones in the leg have been completely displaced in all directions; if the thin thighbone breaks, then the foot turns to the back and if the thick one breaks it happens from below which does not go unnoticed.
He worked with bandaging, reconciliamoining and suturing according to this unless the leg fracture is a gross one with many fragments in which case it should be lessened and gentler while you apply your efforts with surgery.
Once the leg is healed, take two sprigs of willow branches to use in leveling the rooms where you place between window frames or from palm leaves or similar materials.
Choose one that is slightly thick and not brittlete should be the length of the leg from knee to foot, then wrap a piece of cloth around each one along its length twice and place one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Then make the two fÃ¡sqayn at three places from both sides and middle so that with this rope, the leg will not tilt to the right or left but be held straight up properly, and a cane made of wood may be used along the length of the leg.
And it is placed in him to prevent movement and furthermore do that as much as possible during the break if he has a specific injury, then examine the leg every day and take full care of the swelling or inflammation or bruising of that. If something happens from it that is treatable, let the leg heal for as many days or so as necessary.
Chapter XVII (Section 17)
In the section on fractures of the bones and fingers.
As for the ankle, it does not show a fracture of the tibia, but as for the bones and fingers of the foot, they do exhibit a fracture, although generally only to heal without complications.
The foot bones show a fracture and I saw that some of the bones were overlapping from one another in the position where they lay on the ground as if they were piled like sheep, then you put your foot upon them elevated above those bones and crushed them further.
Until they return to their original positions, then carry the plaster and splints above placing them undernenail's foot on a small table with two polished legs, then hold your foot firmly after removing any that need to be split apart by breaking it open.
If it has passed three days or four, then when you remove the cast you find that the bones are as fractured and dislocated as seen previously, but if some of the fingers have healed incorrectly, adjust and realign them according to what you were instructed in finger joint treatment.
Then make a splint along the length of the broken finger to slightly protrude from it, then make under the foot this board that I described to you and fasten it with firm knots; there were two or three or more bones broken.
Make a soft splint for each broken finger and fasten the board under the foot, so that the head of each bone on the board is positioned away from the ankle to align properly.
You should remember to agree with everything we mentioned for you in the rest of this section and all symptoms that we have mentioned, as appropriate.
The eighth chapter.
In the section on broken ribs and humerus bones in men.
A woman's thigh breaks and is bent inward, then both legs are drawn towards her back slightly; the skin at the site of fracture tightens as fat accumulaturess until it fills up again and returns to a shape like that of an apple.
Then the woman cries and lifts her slightly, so that fat escapes until it exits at the vaginal opening in an apple shape; then a clot forms on her back when she wants to urinate, as if expelling fat gently until she does.
He inserts it as you initially described, then returns to the first sponge, doing so for seven days or so until he is cured, and if desired, take a sheep's bladder, squeeebore a tube through its mouth into it completely filling its cavity.
Then he blows into the tube forcefully until the bladder is fully inflated in the cavity, after which it returns, then fills it with cotton as we described and waits for a number of days until cured; when the bone splint from the man or woman cracks, use this method.
He sets it as we described in the shin bone, do not hide from this technique for these strange fractures that you may find and where some have a ridge; yes, because the break itself is indicative of this method in most cases according to my book.
On the way to setting it, bind him tightly and if a man fractures his perineum enter into this then place on him a bandage made of gauze and inflame and leave for three days or so until cured,.
Chapter Nineteebonethree.
In the case of broken bones with fractures.
A person with a fracture should seek immediate assistance from someone skilled in the art of setting bones, especially if it is a large bone such as the femur or tibia. They should promptly perform reduction techniques according to our guidelines.
If the wound is bleeding, it is essential to act immediately by cutting it open and dressing it with a crushed substance if no other remedy is available; then, attend to setting the fracture as soon as possible with care that day without delay.
If no abscess occurs, an abscess that forms should be dealt with the day it appears before it is encapsulated by the hot pus; and if not addressed in the third or fourth following day, it may result in poor outcomes.
If the broken bone is exposed to the skin, it should be promptly and gently set without delay using your hands; if you have not achieved this on your own with a device such as one made of seven finger lengths or eight palm widths long from iron, then use this tool for the procedure. Display it to the extent of the wound.
Therefore, it is for the doctor to take three or four according to how much treatment he needs from each type of fracture and so that they are molded with a little thickness in them so as not to slip when touched during the operation.
And the sharp edge has a fold on its side, and above it is thickened and below half of it slopes greatly, as follows:
Called "pieram" in Greek, it is a small stake and it should be made sharp-edged on the side of the fresh bone and driven into it once so that when the beam returns slightly to its natural position, the excess elevates some equilibrium level for aligning the fracture edges with each other.
Its fractured edge was delicate and the apparatus did not grip it well, so that should be cut off until the device can hold it; however, unable to achieve the bend as we described with the clips mentioned earlier.
Or spread it with one of the splints as you can, then remove what remained in the bone from the roughness and flakes, if the beam returned and found an illness after its return and caused intense painful griefs, know that the bam did not return to its natural place.
Indeed, once the bone has healed at its natural position, if you have set your fracture, immerse it in a tightly sealed black or specific dark liquid if it is summer and do not place anything like oil on the wound.
So that no rot or decay occurs, use bandages during your rest from the bone fracture and leave the wound open to scrape away debris with a scalpel in small punctures on the skin over the injury site.
And be very careful that the wound tightens with a fracture, as inexperiencued doctors caused death or consumption to their patients and you remain flexible rather than following common practices of fastening a break.
The wound was poorly or a large injury, and you feared some bad symptoms we described and found it painful in that spot where it is not proper to place bandages so create a firm puncture at the location of dressings for him and tighten with them.
If after one or two days you see the wound beginning to form scab then remove the bandage that was applied with it and use the plasters and supports as we usually heal surgeries like quaternary dressings, and you should untie the knot.
The wound is examined every evening and morning until it heals and recovers; the bone piece should be removed with a leech-like instrument to allow drainage. After many days, if there are no signs of infection or cessation of pus, one must understand that there may still be small fragments of bone remaining.
It was necessary to examine the wound with a probe, if any fragments were free and could be removed, take them out completely; but if not free, it would cause sore muscle contractions, leading to pain in cutting and removing them entirely on all sides.
The presentation of the wound involving sores, ulcers or another type of putrefaction and infection requires that each case be discussed with the treatment provided as described on its respective page.
It is necessary to stand by and apply your knowledge if a large bone breaks off, exposing the tissue similar to that of thigh or limb bones in adults; do not allow attraction or drainage from them. Often, death presents itself rather than being left to decompose after falling off from it in twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a suitable place for treatment, otherwise leave it alone.
Chapter Ninety.
In Treating Complexities That Appear on a Fragment of Bone.
This complexity often presents on the surface of a bone fragment, especially near joints, where it appears as tissue and possibly prevents the bone from performing its natural function.
It seems that the complexity was smooth, so it is possible to use medicines such as frankincense and lard, myrrh, olibanum (or similar) where some or all are ground and taken with a strong decoction or egg white, or whey.
Apply it to the complexity in a sling and press down firmly, leaving the pressure for many days until it resolves as God wills, or apply a flat piece of molded lead.
Since lead causes issues in all the body parts, if the complexity has hardened and intensified, prompting urgent removal of it from above, cut or unwind the string with some sutures until it resolves and treats the wound until healed.
Chapter on Surgical Instruments and Twenty.
In treating fractures, if the bone remains fragile afterward.
If a bone fracture is present and the bone remains fragile afterward, this could be due to several reasons. One of them could be improper suturing and attachment, or excessively tight bandages causing the tissue to not receive adequate blood supply, or excessive immobilization at an inappropriate time, or excessive movements early on, or insufficient blood circulation within the patient's body.
Treatment for this should include nourishing the patient and exercising their body until blood circulation improves, using baths to introduce joy and happiness along with physical activity, then applying pressure on the affected area so that it draws in plenty of nutrients or maintaining immobilization by wrapping with a moist bandage. Until food is restored and it returns to its natural state,.
Chapter Twenty on Surgical Instruments.
In the treatment of fractures, if an improper healing and a deviation from normal progress occurred.
At times, a limb that has been operated on after an injury, fracture of the bone, or complicated and inflamed condition may show its appearance. However, the limb did not stop performing its natural function; therefore, it should not be claimed by anyone that the bone was broken from above. Many are those who falsely claim this and do so in our country - there have been many deceived physicians and magicians.
This act is greatly condemned as it leads to a great deceit of the physician on the left; however, if the deformation and complication are slight, then one should apply water that has been boiled with mild herbs such as eyebright leaves, root, and aconite in similar manner.
It is bandaged with mild compresses such as those made from eyebright leaves; or one may take the juice of eyebright root and rub it with chicken fat, balm oil, and apply this to the area; or alternatively, they may use fresh almonds crushed together with hen dung paste in a manner similar to those known as 'NÄqidah Al-Ainbal'.
And the complication is resolved by consistent, delicate treatment with hands and through movement of the limb in all directions at each time; but if there has been a deformation that may have worsened, calcified, and necessitated intervention, then it should be treated with iron-based medication.
It was necessary to scrape the bone and release the connection of the bone, cutting as much of the compound or bone as possible with fine strips, then treating the wound carefully and diligently until it healed.
Chapter Three and Twenty.
The joint is a dislocation of the bone from its position in the joint, causing deformation of the shape and occurring with severe pain or illness or chronic conditions; then it should be immediately addressed to restore function.
It should not be delayed if the position is advanced and a tumor obstructs it, preventing closure of the joint; therefore it should not be postponed or moved or extended while inflamed because it often occurs with severe pain or illness.
But if that occurs, it should immediately address the illness and leave until the tumor settles a little, then elevate the limb with hot water and oil, then carefully treat each joint as mentioned in its position.
The sections of the joint were also arranged according to their presentation from the upper part of the body downwards,...
Chapter Four Hundred.
In the Treatment of Unbinding the Lower Lip.
Say that none except in the case of an abscess should be left, and remove them so that they are either on one side or another - either completely removed gradually by dissolution or totally separated. Then rest for a while slightly. Towards the chest until it softens the pus and cannot hold it or can be pressed down, so that the lip may not stick together completely and swell, but if it is gradually separated, then more often than not it will return to its previous state on the left side.
But if it is completely separated, one should hasten to heal the wound and not delay or hold fast of its head and enter the doctor's thumb at the origin of the lip within the mouth. If the flap is from a single side.
Or he enters both thumbs if the flap is from both sides and wraps his fingers around it outside to hold the injury commanding its retraction and opening, so that it may go in all directions; and the doctor wraps it and pushes the flap until it returns to position.
Indeed, difficulty of healing and especially if the joints are all affected should be treated with warm water and fat until they ease their swelling and do not delay in healing as we said. If it returns and stabilizes but then relaxes again, place a bandage of torn fabric soaked in a mixture made from myrrh and oil.
Then loosely bind the relaxed joints, and let the patient rest on their back with a pillow under each shoulder to prevent them from moving left or right and causing difficulty in swallowing. Instead, make their food soft enough to swallow easily.
If the pain subsides and the joints become stable, then they should eat what is available to them without causing discomfort when opening their mouth while easterning or drinking until the joint becomes stable and heals.
If the difficulty of healing a joint occurs and it does not move to its original position frequently, causing persistent swelling and pain and possibly bulging at the stomach of the patient with possible loss of pure urine if observed, know that it is impaired.
Often he dies within ten days.
Chapter Five and Twenty.
In response to shoulder dislocation and the lower edge of the collarbone.
As for dislocation, it does not detach from its internal attachment to the chest and may be everted outward, which is evident by touching, forcing the condition to recede onto his back and lengthen his arms.
Then, apply pressure to the spot with your hand firmly so that it returns, then place the dressing and tape it, and whatever edge that leads towards the collarbone and is attached does not slip away except in rarity when one day must heal and be guided as we mentioned and what seems appropriate.
Then place the dressing and tape, command the injury to bandage and rest until healed, with this treatment his dislocated collarbone returns if it also leaves its position,.
Chapter Six Twenty.
In response to a dislocated collarbone.
Note that the collarbone only dislocates in three ways, one so it everted downwards and another towards the chest and perhaps upwards above the collarbone, which is rare.
There is no tearing behind the place of the shoulder or in front of the place of the nerve, but more tears out towards the thigh and especially in those with little fat because it exits quickly and enters quickly.
For those with a lot of fat, it is as if it exits reluctantly and enters reluctently, and sometimes such a fall or slip in the groin causes severe pain as one thinks it has torn there and should have been palpated until healthy again.
At this point, for treatment, if the torn part is towards the thigh approaching between the prolapsed and the healthy groin, you will find between them a superficial difference and you will find the head of the groin in it weakened and near the thigh upon touching the head of the groin as if it were an egg.
The patient does not value raising the hand to his ear or moving it in all movements, and similarly if torn towards the chest or above, you will find this superficial upon touching without missing.
This tear may facilitate its recovery. If it was smooth or the patient is a boy, let him raise his hand upwards then make your thumbs underne.his thigh and lift the joint strongly to above its position and the palm raises and stretches upwards.
Then he inserts it into the patient, and when released promptly, it does not return as we mentioned. After many days have passed since the incident, it is necessary for the injured to bathe in hot water, use the tools that are pulled and stretched like cooking the origins of tears, glasses, and king's hawthorn in water.
Then the injured person is lifted onto their back and a ball of wool that is moderately tense between softness and hardness is placed underne cuff, after which the doctor steps on it and holds the injured's hand with his own and stretches it downward.
He pushes the ball with his foot, and if you wish to repeat this as well, have a longer leg than the injured person stand on one side and stop them from moving forward; then insert it under their cuff and lift the sleeve until the injured person is hanging in the air. Another method involves pulling the injured's hand down to their stomach, which if they are light should be hung with something else for relief; this will make it return as fast as a minute passes and may also work on another face.
It is that on the ground, a long piece of wood whose head has the shape of a haw's beak, not thick or narrow, then place under the afflicted limb after placing over the top of the wood, a soft tear and the affected part standing along the length of the wood.
Then his hand is stretched downwards from the other side and he also extends his body from the other side forcefully, so that the joint returns to its place quickly; if difficulty arises in recovery, use all the methods we mentioned for this treatment and take a stick of length similar to two arms. And present it a span of four fingers and make its head curved so that it is easier to insert into the depths of the joint on this image:.
Then tie on the curved head a thin tear so as not to harm the affected wood, and then position under the joint and stretch all fingers and arm down onto the wood, tying the stick at the shaft, thigh, and side of the hand.
Then place the arm on a board. Slide with the board sideways and stretch all fingers downwards, leaving the rest of the body suspended from the other side so that the joint is entered from its edge; if it enters at any face possible, it should be placed undernelevated pad of an appropriate size made of wool.
Then he takes the prepared bandage with flour dust and egg whites onto the entire incision, wrapping it around from above, then tightly compresses the ball underneeband, firmly tying it on the bandage from top to bottom, holding it in place by his hand.
He is not to move his hand for seven days, and it should be that the patient's food intake remains minimal until the affected part heals faster than before, then after seven or five days, gradually exercises if stable and has not regressed in health.
It has been found that the joint is removed a lot due to moisture exposure or some other reason, it should be used in him with three layers of gauze provided at the entrance of his limb, this was done and examined the bandage after seven days but did not confirm the joint.
The bandage and compression were repeated several times but did not stabilize, fell off, and rested; it is known that the nerve in his forehead has either been cut, extended or relaxed so as to know that the joint never settles in its place.
Regarding the dislocation that is towards the chest and limb, and behind it to push and stretch with the hand until it returns, which is used in tensioning and treatment until recovery, after the swelling subsides in the limb and slows down movement.
The feverish disease does not function as a frequent urine until that swelling is softened and returns to its original state,
Chapter Seven and Twenty.
In the treatment of joint dislocation.
The elbow joint dislocs and relocates with difficulty, as well as it dislocates to all sides and especially to the back or front; the dislocation is not hidden from you because it is under visual perception and by touching in any shape.
If the dislocated elbow is positioned correctly, it will appear to you through an outward bending of the joint and its inability to flex or reach with its tip; you should promptly be alerted for the fracture to slip away from your hour before it shows a fiery red.
It is an onset of difficulty with redness and relocation; if the tip did not recover, especially if it were to the back, then he hardens all types of fractures and exacerbates them and pains intensely as they often accompany death.
He must do so if it is possible for him to extend the patient's arm as far as he can with his own hands and arms extended, with the doctor placing one hand above the joint and another below, pushing on the joint with both thumbs or with the tips of his fingers until reaching its original position.
If the joint has moved too far and must be corrected by bending the arm until it hits with the tip of his little finger, one should not use excessive force when reducing; rather, let the arm be gradually extended.
The patient also holds the arm in both hands so that it does not slip when stretching; then let the arm go to each side after putting a rolled or flat bandage on his hand, and if the doctor grasps the joint with his hand, he should grease it with oil for easy reduction of the joint.
Then push the joint firmly until it returns, and after returning, he should wear a compress that dries with egg whites and presses tightly; then let his arm hang from the elbow of the injured limb for some days.
Then, if the joint is fixed in its place, remove the suture and leave it alone; if the joint does not become more stable, then reapply the bandage and the sutures as well, leaving them until stability increases, after which they should be removed and a swelling will occur when the joint returns to normal.
If there is difficulty in movement, soak it in the bath and gently massage it until it becomes flexible or place a thick bandage on the joint, then bind it and leave it for a day and night; afterwards remove it and enter the bath again if there is excessive sweating from the joint.
Then, replace the bandage for a second and third time with bathing until it becomes flexible; if you desire to make him more supple by using warm camel dung mixed with fat, do so repeatedly, as he will regain his original condition again.
The Eighth and Twentieth Chapters.
In the treatment of dislocating a shoulder.
The elbow joint often dislocs easily, except for the other joints; it is necessary that its relocation occurs within an hour after the dislocation before moving or exposing to heat.
Albucasis instructs to place the sick's bone on a board, have an assistant extend their arm and for the physician to put his hand over the joint of the fracture and push until it returns, unless it has slipped into the palm of the hand.
The sick should lie down with their arm extended and in repose, if the prominent bone protrudes to the hand'amoeba surface, place your inner hand on the board so that the doctor can lay his hand over the joint of the fracture and move away when ready unless it is held back by an anti-inflammatory compress.
Let him not recover, as it is unlikely and he cannot respond after days have passed unless the joint remains bent and does not harm the sick except if his arm relaxes and he cannot grasp anything.
Then you know that the nerve has severed or torn with no hope except to bind it tightly, perhaps it may help and maybe it did not help at all; if the bone fragment is healed, apply the dressing we described then bind for five days.
Then the hand swells and immobility occurs, present with some edema; then bathe it in warmed vinegar and oil several times until they pass.
Chapter 92 and 100.
In the treatment of finger fractures.
The fingers may have fractured at any point from the finger to the surface or interior of the palm; extended and pushed back the fracture with your thumb until it healed, then attach the head of the finger and hang it towards the side that broke.
Leave it for two days, then release and stretch until its alignment is normal in those two days if that happens at night, attach as instructed above but still keep moving during the day and train, do this at night until it stabilizes.
Similarly, do as you did first with the fingers that have fractured inside the hand and attach them towards the same side until healed, also do as you did when they fractured on the surface of other parts,.
Chapter 30.
In the treatment of shoulder dislocations.
When a shoulder dislocation occurs from shoulder dislocangs or complete separation of the neck or many bones have gone out of place, there is no treatment because death accelerates to illness.
This indicates that the illness escapes involuntarily and cannot be grasped, often relaxing some of its parts either legs or arms or one of them, and if a shoulder dislocation has gone out of place by far, it is missing frequently.
He will disappear in four directions until he disappears behind what is called the bone, and as for treating it, one must see that if the bone has occurred from a slap or similar injury, there is no treatment or relief in it. And as for those which have happened due to falling or hitting likewise.
The early ones discussed treating it with lengthy words that are not more beneficial, and she abbreviated a little of it as much less than what was conveyed from her understanding and explanation to depict the instrument different from how they defined and explained it.
I say that the bone that occurs from behind in the chest has no remedy or relief, and so do those occurring to both sides as well; only it is treated when it arises on the back because I have described it in this way: it extends across its face.
On a shelf below the wall, with something underneath simplified and moistened to prevent harming his chest; then he places a vertical stick inserted into a hole in the ground at one side of the shelf towards its head and another stick on the other side of the shelf toward his legs.
The servant holds the wood, which is not anchored in the pit, and another servant holds the rest on that framework; then it breaks above the patient's chest with flexible yet firm cords extending to the wood at its head, where it is attached.
Then it tightens with more cords on the shoulders and knees, and at the hips; then all the ropes are gathered together and attached to another piece of wood near his feet; each servant extends towards that piece ofwood by a cord without detaching their original positions. The two pieces of wood do not move from their centered places in it.
However, they are still not anchored as we said, and the doctor places his hand forcefully on the incision until it closes or he lays a board over it; then he sits on the board with his legs until it returns. If this treatment does not work, another board of roughly three arm lengths is taken.
And she digs near the wall where we said would be close to the patient; placing a board in the middle of it and setting her feet on one end while the doctor puts his legs on the other, tightening firmly until he suppresses the spasm.
It refers to the place where it is, even if you want to make it with a loom that is held in hand and causes to fall on the ground at the head of the patient in another pillar of wood measuring one cubit by two arms length. And also at his feet in another pillar of wood.
It should be between each piece of wood a span, and in each piece of wood a hole has been made through which the loom runs, securing all the wood on the ground so that no part of the fabric moves until it is fully threaded with a loop wound around the loops of the two holes.
And at the end there is a loop tied with a string that extends to a span, which wound around those two other pieces of wood like this, then pulling the cord that you pulled in the patient's chest in the loom at its head and the cords that you pulled in his legs in the loom.
Then stand at each loom with the shuttle in hand through which it is wound and the doctor raises his palm over what you presented, this is a picture of the loom, the pillar, and the patient: [IMAGE].
Then, after the rib returns and settles into place, it is necessary to apply a dried egg white plaster, followed by manipulation, and then place a splint over the plaster so that its width is three fingers or so and its length reaches the position of the rib.
In the case of a correctly placed stitch, it is used to tie with the suture that should be used and the patient continues with light food until they recover; in this way, some residual discomfort remains at the site but then one should use medication that relieves pain and takes effect along with using the board we described for a long time.
This can be used to remove other spine stitches and it will be considered an extra bone that has not healed, which is unlikely to be affected by this treatment in case of death occurrences.
The thirtieth chapter.
Regarding the surgery for a dislocated joint.
Note that the hip and knee joints only present with dislocation, not the gradual degeneration and deterioration seen in other joints, and the hip joint can be dislocated on four different planes.
That he separates into the inside and outside, as well as to the left and right, and even more so that he separates into the inside; moreover, if you bend the correct leg of the sick person towards yourself, it will be longer.
The ankle is more correct than the limb, and the patient cannot bend his leg during the gallop; the position in which he leans while galloping indicates that the head of the gastrocnemius has reached there.
The mark that indicates the bone moving outward has symptoms against these symptoms, and the mark indicating movement towards the side simplifies the leg completely except for not being able to bend it without pain in the knee; running cannot be done from there onwards.
The pole and the calf of his leg are bound, and while walking he leans backward; the mark indicating movement towards the back indicates that the knee cannot be simplified or bent before bending at the ankle, and also making the leg shorter than the others.
"The rabbit is relaxed, and the back of its thigh is located at bony prominence Bina. Regarding this type of fracture, it appears that the fracture was old as it healed with its companion and has not been repaired; therefore, it remained in its condition without treatment.
"It should not be exposed to it, and as for the one that was recently fractured, determine which of the four types of fractures it is so that you may know whether or not it extends into the joint capsule and extends both inwardly and outwardcups and moves towards left and right.
"He did not require any treatment from others; thus, it was appropriate that a strong assistant stretched his leg either by holding onto the foot or attaching ropes above the ankle and another assistant pulled.
"Let his assistant insert their hand under the bandage, then hold a soft rope on the shin and grab its end while another third assistant pulls; it should be pulled either from behind towards the rabbit's side or from in front to the other side.
The length of all of them should be one time so that the ailment may rise with their body from the ground and remain suspended, for this type of bandaging is common to four types, so we recommend removing as described before; otherwise, there is no need for each specific type mentioned in the treatment.
As for its own response, if the joint goes inside properly, then bandages should be applied correctly on one side of it and between the head of the thigh and the position below where the buttocks meet.
Then the bandage should be extended from the buttocks to the upper body and then take another support with his arm muscles, embracing the heavy site of the afflicted thigh, extending it outwards with a very tight bandage so that it returns to its place.
This type of treatment is easier than the others, so you cannot enter this kind of joint with such an immediate cure; it should be that afflicted legs are tied with gentle bandages at both ankles and knees.
After each one, the owner should be four fingers wide and the affected leg longer than the others by two fingers. Then hang the afflicted on a wooden beam in the house, with its feet resting on the ground at arm's length.
Then, instruct a strong boy to embrace the hind leg and another boy to hold onto it while pushing strongly; the joint will return to its place quickly unless there is a dislocation outside of the joint.
It was necessary to place the afflicted on the shelf as described in "The Head of Bones," with ropes tightened around its affected leg and chest, then placing two beams at his feet and another beam across his back, securely fastened to the shelf.
It may have been that a wet sore caused by the affliction made the beam between his thighs attract downward when extended, then each servant was stretched towards him and the physician adjusted it with his hands, responding to this.
Otherwise, set the board and press it as mentioned in "The Head of Bones," or at least to ensure that the afflicted is correctly positioned; if there was a slipping to one side, then extend his affected leg once more while observing from this description on the shelf.
The physician places his right hand on the ailing donkey and presses with his left hand, while ensaturating the pressure downward towards the thigh; if the protrusion is towards the back, it should be stretched further downwards.
He is elevated on the ground, but should be laid flat as previously mentioned; his leg should also be bent outward according to how we discussed bending it against the counter. The bandages are tightened.
As we previously mentioned, the fomentation with cloths should also be used on the location from which the joint of the leg protrudes; if you're drawing the limb correctly and the mark is clearly visible to you, it should stretch out the sick animal's leg.
If you see two levels and the sick animal is gripping and relaxing its leg without difficulty, understand that it has returned to what should be; then bend both shanks and apply a poultice tightly so that the knee cannot move in any direction.
The sick animal must be at rest for three or four days; then loosen the bandages and poultice, and support its leg with the other. If you see them at ease, understand that the fracture has set and release the animal to walk; even if you observe some relaxation in it.
Return and bandage it according to your initial compression, also leave it for three days, then loosen it and let him walk on it for a few days until the fracture is healed, by God's will.
Chapter two and three.
In treating a dislocated joint.
The joint dislocates in three ways: internally, externally, and downward toward the shin; it does not pop out towards the heel. Its sign of dislocation is that the limb commands to encircle itself with its own leg.
If it does not adhere to the shin, be sure that the joint is dislocated; all faces of the dislocation command the limb to sit on its own leg. Stretch your legs if possible and have the patient lie with his back against something to grasp it in the middle and pull himself slightly backwards then you sit on his calves.
His back touches his face and makes your leg between your legs, then strains his ankle with your hands on it, interlocks them on his aneckle, and grips another side of the joint strongly before having him extend his other leg until the joint returns to its place.
Mark the shank with a non-toxic color, then bandage it and attach the leg to the thigh for three or four days, then release them, relying only on minimal walking until strengthened.
It is not feasible as we described, only use the bandages provided for treatment of fractures until they heal completely.
The Third and Thirty Chapters.
In the treatment of hip fractures.
The hip may collapse while walking and can fully dislocate, either internally or externebly; you should observe the hip bulging prominently towards that side which it has dislocated.
To treat a partial dislocation, it is easier to allow the limb to rest comfortably in bandages until recovery; for complete dislocaturen, the patient should sit upright and hold their leg steady with supporting arms behind them at waist level.
Then hold the patient's right foot from above and left foot from below at the joint level, then gently pull each foot alternately with your hands until bent twice, straighten it again, and push its chest towards their thigh non-aggressively.
This is done as we described, then push the chest onto the thigh in the third time and you proceed with the weights, if it returns once or twice on this quality, and the foot appears level but otherwise return to work on it, because it returns.
Stop as we described, otherwise remove the injury from his back on the ground and insert a peg in the ground securely to lie between his thighs, with him wrapped so that no further damage occurs to the injury. Then adjust his stretcher's footrest.
Then extend the second man'either his hands or handcuffs attached to the neck of the person, then extend each footrest except for the first one and place it between the thighs of the injured person so that he holds it without pulling his body downward during the extension, then the doctor removes his shackles.
Another man holds the correct leg down quickly if the pin returns and it becomes clear that the retraction is successful, then you should take the bandage, splint, and tighten him with strong straps and lift his foot up with a strap to below, and he must avoid touching the nerve above the knee from behind.
Unless the bandage is very tight and then leave it for two or three days until the bandage relaxes, then remove it on the third or fourth day, and let the ailment be kept from walking for forty days.
Walking before this period does not ensure that the fracture heals properly and avoids infection, and is then presented with a hot tumor; it should be treated according to our prescription elsewhere without movement until recovery.
The Fourth and Thirtieth Section.
In the treatment of fractures in a man's fingers.
The fracture should be straightened by a non-violent stride, not difficult but facilitated; in some cases of the ankle joint, it was deemed necessary for the injury to have its foot elevated above ground level.
Or if seated as a person walking, then place your foot on what seems to be those joints and press them firmly with your heel until they return stiffly without showing in the position you desired.
Then make the sole of his foot like a plate holding the whole foot with two heels and press it firmly for three days, then loosen and cover from walking for many days until stiffness sets in and ensures its return if God wills.
Chapter Five and Thirty-Two.
In the types of fractures that are with a wound, or with a cut, or both together.
When such a thing occurred and its treatment was frequently followed by death.
Therefore, it should not be brought to treat such things except by one who is skillful in the craft, with a long background, careful and compassionate, not hasty, and uses only those medications that inhabit hot tumors at first and then bring the disease under control.
May God grant us but health from the illness with a slight improvement and bring hope to you in it, so that we can give an early response from your part first before a hot tumor occurs.
The return of the member on what you desired to use a treatment that inhabits hot tumors and heals wounds as deemed fit from dried bandages, resulted in a fracture with a cut and happened by splinters coming out freely. And follow in this what we mentioned to you in the simple diseases and present it as prescribed for them.
Your effort and guidance lead me away from the path of foolishness as you have instructed; I shall remain steadfast in my task, submitting to your display if Allah wills it so.
