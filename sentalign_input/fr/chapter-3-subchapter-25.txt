Of the collarbone  
The collarbone cannot dislocate from the rib internally where it connects to the chest, but it sometimes dislocates externally, and it is easily felt.  
The treatment is for the patient to lie often on his back and extend his arms; then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return; then apply a plaster and a bandage, and tighten it.  
The end near the shoulder cannot dislocate; if it does sometimes dislocate, then return it to its place, as we have said; then apply the plaster and bandage, and tighten it, and command the patient to rest until it is healed.  
And in the same way, the head of the shoulder is reduced when it is out of place.
