Chapter XIV.
On the treatment of contracture that occurs on the lower eyelid.
This contracture which occurs on the lower eyelid, which is truly called contracture; some are natural, others accidental.
But accidental contracture is caused by a wound, incision, cauterization, or other similar causes.
The procedure for this is to take a needle with a double thread, insert it into the flesh, and pass it from the left lacrimal gland to the right lacrimal gland until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upward with the needle and suture it with the needle, making a wide incision.
Then if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, it is good; if not, take the needle and place it in the split shape, and with it turn the eyelid, making two incisions on the side of the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two incisions form two angles of the incision, which you have made to converge, and let their shape form an angle that, when joined together, forms a figure.
And this figure is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is on the edge of the lower part of it, where it cuts the eyelid.
Then bring the separated parts together and suture them with woolen thread; treat them with what we have mentioned about softening medicines and warm applications until it is healed.
If the contracture occurs due to a fissure, suture, or cauterization, then you must cut with a flat incision over the hairs of the eyelid as described before.
Then separate with the warm application between the two edges as we have described.
In summary, the treatment of contracture whether above or below, proceeds with the operation according to the prepared form of the contracture, which is of various kinds.
And the wise practitioner always prepares in every possible way to restore the shape to its natural form, or as close to it as possible, and treats the patient according to the requirements of the operation and the instruments with the best arrangements.
