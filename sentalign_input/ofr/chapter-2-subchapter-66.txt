of fleshy hernia
In this affliction, I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the treatment with a knife.
And the ancients said that it is done like the hernia that is together with the screw, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after cutting above them lightly underneath; 
then cut it in the middle, and treat the abscess with something that opens it, until the vessels fall off;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
