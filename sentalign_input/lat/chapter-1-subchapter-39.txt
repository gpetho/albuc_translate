On the Method of Cauterizing the Uterus
Chapter 41.
When cold and moisture affect the uterus, preventing conception, causing menstrual irregularities, delays, and pain upon menstruation, it is necessary to cauterize with three cauteries around the navel, as described in bladder cauterization. Apply an additional cautery over the pubic region below the back, or use two cauteries, and use the nail-shaped cautery.
