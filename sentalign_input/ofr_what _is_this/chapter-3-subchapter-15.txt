of the kneecap
Know that in the kneecap, fractures rarely occur, but it often bends.
And if it breaks, it is only a fissure, or a hole, and it occurs with a wound, as well as without a wound, and this one feels readily.
And the restoration is that you put together what is round with your fingers, so that it is assembled as best as you can; then apply the plaster, and put a round splint on it, if you need one, and tighten it as needed, then consider all the conditions that we have mentioned in other fractures, such as hot abscesses and other similar things; then address each issue with what is appropriate for it, until it is healed.
