Of the fractured thigh	On setting a fracture of the femur.	0.43680352
The thigh bone is often fractured, and it is easily seen when it turns forward and backward; and the restoration is such that a bandage is tied above the fracture, and another below. And the patient lies on their back, then each assistant stretches their part evenly; and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.	The femur is often broken, and this is readily discernible, for it will rotate forwards or backwards. It is set by binding a bandage above the fracture and another below, while the patient lies flat on his face. Then each assistant should make an even extension in his own direction, by the bandage. This is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.	0.9077868
And if the fracture is near the root of the thigh, then one of the bandages should be near the groin, and the other below the fracture. And similarly, if it is near the knee, then the bandage should be near the knee, and the extension below; then the physician sets the bone evenly with his two hands, until it is in its natural shape, and then applies the poultice, and binds it, if no hot abscess forms.	But if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, you should tie on a soft bandage of wool or something similar, at the root of the thigh toward the groin, so that extension may be applied above, and another bandage below the fracture. Likewise if the fracture is near the knee the bandage should be near the knee, so that extension may be made downwards. Then the doctor should straighten it out with both hands until he has reduced it to the pattern of the natural form and the bone unites neatly.	0.8305796
And if there is a hot abscess, then let it settle, then return to your work and care; the binding is done in this way. You should wrap over the fracture a hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the root of the buttock, and put a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and the ends of the thread come above; then turn the bandage over the leg and the thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the bone of the leg; then fill the space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloth to make the binding even, then start binding firmly three or four times over the fracture; and the further you go from the fracture, the less you bind; then address the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and the thigh, and tie three splints above, then go down to the end of the thread, until you reach the foot; and bind it, so that it does not move from its place, then leave it so, provided that no abscess or swelling or anything similar occurs.	Then start with three or four turns of a strong bandage in the middle over the site of the fracture, and as you get away from the site of the fracture bind lighter and softer and looser. Then turn to the two ends of the cord which you previously passed between the thigh and the leg, and with the cord bind the adjacent splints above, then carry the ends downward until you end up at the great tendon of the foot and with them bind also the extremities of the splints at the other end so that the bandaging will not shift from its place. Then let the bandaging remain on as long as no pruritus or abscess or effusion or anything of that sort happens to the limb; but if any of these occur loosen it quickly and put right whatever has taken place, in the manner we have often mentioned.	0.89805996
And if it does occur, then unbind it, and adjust what occurs, as we have said many times; and if there are pieces of bone that pierce, they should be removed, if possible; and if it is not possible, then the area should be cut, and the pieces extracted; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.	If there be a penetrating fragment of the bone, you must reposition it if you can; but if not then cut down upon it and remove it and treat the wound in the sort of way mentioned previously, until it heals.	0.685135
And sometimes the thigh is fractured so that splints are placed, as in the shoulder and arm; however, with the restoration done this way, the patient does not limp.	This fracture of the thigh is sometimes bandaged without bringing the leg alongside with splints, in the way we spoke of for the humerus and the forearm. But setting after the former manner does not cause the patient any lameness; whereas if the femur is set alone without binding the leg to it the patient will inevitably be lame for always.	0.73530453
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, depending on the diversity of complexions.	You must know that the femur knits in fifty days or a little more or less, according to the different constitutions and other circumstances.	0.7325536
