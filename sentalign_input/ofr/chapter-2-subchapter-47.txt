Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, so much so that they resemble women's breasts;
and they remain unsightly and swollen, and whoever wants to treat them, must cauterize them according to this shape from this line b. down to g.:
then scrape away the fat, and fill the wound with medicine generating flesh, then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops down and is softened by its size as happens with women, then split it into two parts from above, with two similar incisions;
of which one is connected to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line b. down to line g.;
then scrape the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not fully made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment;
and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
