of fleshy hernia
In this type of hernia I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the treatment with an iron instrument.
And the ancients said that it is done like the hernia which is near the face, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after cutting above or lightly below; then cut in the middle, and treat the abscess of the one who operates, until the vessels fall off; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
