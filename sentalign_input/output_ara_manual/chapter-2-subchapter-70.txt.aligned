Hermaphroditism occurs in men in two ways: one is that there appears below the perineum or in the scrotum's skin between the two testicles a form as if it were a woman's vulva, with hair in it. And urine may flow from the one that is in the scrotum's skin.	There are two kinds of male hermaphrodite: one has the appearance as of female pudenda with hair in the region of the perineum; the other has the same in the skin of the scrotum between the testes. Sometimes also urine is excreted through that which is in the skin of the scrotum.	0.86783266
As for in women, it is of one type, and it is above the vulva on the pubis, like very small male testicles, protruding outward, one of them as if it were a man's penis, and the two like testicles. And the treatment of the three types...	There is also one kind among women, in which there is, above the female pudenda, on the pubes, what resembles the male organs. These are small indeed, but protuberant, one being like the penis and the two others like testicles.	0.78860277
The two types in men and the one type in women, it is necessary to cut off those excess growths until their trace is obliterated, then treat them with the treatment of all other wounds until they heal. As for the second type in men, from which urine comes out, the one that is in the scrotum's skin, there is no treatment for it, nor any hope of recovery at all.	This is the treatment of all three kinds, that is, two male and one female: the superfluous growths must be cut away so that every trace is destroyed; then the usual treatment for wounds should be applied until they are healed. As to the second kind, in man, where the opening is in the scrotum and the urine runs out of it, there is no operation for this, and no cure.	0.8443023
