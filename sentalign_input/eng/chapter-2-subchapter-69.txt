 CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE.
On castration.
 Castration is forbidden in our law and I ought therefore to make no mention of it in my book.
But I must speak of it for two reasons.
One reason is that it should be part of the doctor's medical knowledge when asked about it, and that he should know how to treat anyone whom it befalls.
Another reason is that often we need to castrate certain animals for the sake of the benefits that accrue from them, such as rams, he-goats and cats, and such animals.
So I say that castration can be performed in two ways: either by contusion; or by opening up and cutting away.
The method by contusion is that we make the animal sit in warm water until his testes are relaxed and become soft and pendent; then rub them with your hand until they are so loosened that they are no longer palpable.
As to castration by open operation and excision, the animal should be held and pressure put upon the scrotum with the left hand.
Then tie the spermatic cord and with one incision cut down upon both testicles so that both are brought up out of the scrotum.
After dissecting them away cut them off; do not leave any of the coverings upon them except the thin membrane covering the vessels.
This manner of castration is better than the contusion method, for contusion often leaves something of the testicles, and the animal desires to couple.
Then dress the wound until healed.
