Chapter Seventy.
On the Treatment of the Hermaphrodite.
Hermaphroditism occurs in men in two ways: one is that there appears below the perineum or in the scrotum's skin between the two testicles a form as if it were a woman's vulva, with hair in it. And urine may flow from the one that is in the scrotum's skin.
As for in women, it is of one type, and it is above the vulva on the pubis, like very small male testicles, protruding outward, one of them as if it were a man's penis, and the two like testicles. And the treatment of the three types...
The two types in men and the one type in women, it is necessary to cut off those excess growths until their trace is obliterated, then treat them with the treatment of all other wounds until they heal. As for the second type in men, from which urine comes out, the one that is in the scrotum's skin, there is no treatment for it, nor any hope of recovery at all.
