On the treatment of cancer.
Chapter 53.
We have already discussed the types of cancer, and the way to treat it with medicines: and caution is required in its treatment with the knife, to prevent ulceration: and we spoke of cancer arising in the womb, and the caution in its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is located in a place where it is possible to remove it, as in cancer of the breasts, or the thigh, and similar areas, from parts that allow its complete extraction: especially when it is small in its early stages.
But when it becomes old and large, it is not advisable to approach it.
For I could not cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me who succeeded in doing so.
And the procedure, when it is situated as we mentioned, is to first cleanse the patient several times of black bile.
Then perform bloodletting on him if you find him obviously full.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation suitable for the operation.
Then apply hooks to the cancer that suit it.
Afterward, hollow it out from every part along with the skin, according to examination, until nothing of its roots remains: and allow the blood to flow, and do not cut it off quickly; rather, press the places and wipe away all thick blood by hand, or with any possible instrument.
But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein causes you trouble, then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops.
Then treat it with the remaining remedies, until it heals.
