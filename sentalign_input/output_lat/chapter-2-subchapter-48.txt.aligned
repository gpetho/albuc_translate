These abscesses that occur beneath the Titillicus are of the hard types of Strophulas, which contain cysts, and some of them contain fluids.	These tumours under the armpit are of the type of scrofulous tumours, hard, enclosed in a capsule. Some contain humidity.	0.6666294
Those among them that contain fluids must therefore be cut with a crescent-shaped incision, in this form, from line b. to line g. Then, when everything within the abscess is drained of infection, fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.	Those that contain humidity should be opened with a semicircular incision like this, from b to g. When you have removed all the pus that had been in the tumour, pack the wound with teased-out cotton wool and leave till another day.	0.7578448
Then remove the cotton, and treat it with suitable ointment until it heals.	Then remove the cotton wool and dress with a suitable ointment until healed.	0.93052363
But if the abscess is of the type of Strophula nodes, then incise it above, as we have said in the section on Strophulas.	If the tumour be of the nodular scrofulous kind, cut directly down on it just as we prescribed for that kind.	0.61465645
If, however, the wound extends so that it releases pus, then apply cautery to it, as we have discussed previously.	If the wound continue to discharge pus, apply the cautery to it as prescribed before.	0.77173984
