of the hair that pricks the eye
Sometimes it happens that the eyelashes turn inward and prick the eye, and cauteries are applied in two ways: either with fire or with burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, place the patient on your lap; then mark on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, with the beginning of the mark near the hairs; then apply cotton soaked in egg white and parsley mucilage on the eye, then heat the cautery of which this is the shape:
Afterward, cauterize over the marked figure gently many times, so that the core is burned in that area; the sign of successful work is that you see the eyelid retract and the hairs lift from the eye's surface; then lift your hand, and leave it for three days, then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is gone; afterward treat with ointment until healed.
And if after this the hairs come back and the eyelid is softened, then restart the cautery on the same spot as you did first; and if the hairs are outside, cauterize until the eyelid is lifted to its natural place, and is even, so the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery with burning medicine requires instructing the patient to let the hairs grow long and even, then making a shape like a myrtle leaf out of parchment; then take French soap and quicklime, each one ounce, and grind them together well; do it quickly so it doesn't cool, then spread it on the parchment shaped like the myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid; and if the disease is in one eye, work on one, or both if in both; place cotton soaked in egg white below the eye; and let the patient's head be on your lap and place your index finger on the medicine, pressing gently and moving it whenever the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, as it feels like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger.
And when the burning sensation has passed, wash the area with water, and check if you see the eyelid lifted as if by fire or incision; if so, it is good. If not, reapply the medicine on the spot where it has not worked, until your work is even and the eyes are aligned; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burned core falls off, afterward treat the area with ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And it is necessary to be very careful in your work so that no medicine falls into the eyes. And if the eyelid becomes soft again and the hairs prick the eye, restart the medicine on the softened spot of the eyelid exactly as you did before; afterward treat until it is healed; and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that human eyes vary in size and shape, and adjust your treatment accordingly; and the correct method should not be revealed to anyone not dedicated to this art.
