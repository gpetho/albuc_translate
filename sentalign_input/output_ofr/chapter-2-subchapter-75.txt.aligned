For it sometimes comes feet first, and the body or the head and the hands come out, or it comes on its stomach, or often, and is perhaps turned on its neck, and in other bad positions; so it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skilled in these things, and to beware of error and deception, and I will show you all the positions and how one should assist them.	Sometimes the infant is delivered by its feet; or by its hands before either head or feet; or a single hand or foot; or the head comes out together with a foot. Or it comes out all twisted, often with the nape of the neck first; or in other wrong positions. So the midwife must have wisdom and dexterity and be skilled in all these cases and beware of failures and mistakes. I shall explain the technique in these modes of delivery so that she may be instructed and may be acquainted with them all.	0.860413
If the child comes head first by natural delivery, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, have her sit on a birthing stool, where the women hold her; and revive her nature with oil or cooked fenugreek, and then the midwife places between her fingers the small spatula of which here is the shape:	When the foetus comes out by the vertex in the normal manner and yet the delivery is with great difficulty for the woman and you see that her strength is getting exhausted, then make her sit on a seat and have her held firmly, and foment her womb in a decoction of fenugreek and in bland oils. Then the midwife should take between two fingers a little scalpel and make an incision in the foetal membrane or open it with the finger nail, to allow the contained waters to flow out; and put pressure upon the woman's abdomen until the foetus comes down.	0.77624047
and tear the afterbirth/amniotic sac, and cut with her fingernail so that the liquid which is inside runs out; and press the woman's belly so that the child descends, and if it does not descend, then give the woman an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil; then make her grab and sneeze from hellebore, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: the child will come out immediately.	Then the midwife should take between two fingers a little scalpel and make an incision in the foetal membrane or open it with the finger nail, to allow the contained waters to flow out; and put pressure upon the woman's abdomen until the foetus comes down. But if it will not come down then the woman should have an enema of mucilage of fenugreek with oil of sesame. Then bid her bear down after the enema, and with ptarmica stimulate her to sneeze; and close her mouth and nose for a while and the foetus will quickly come out.	0.8405511
And if the two hands come out, you must gently push them back in little by little; and if they cannot go back in, put the woman on a seat, and lift her feet up high; then push the seat down to the ground, and someone hold the woman so that she doesn't fall when it is pushed down; and if the hands cannot be put back in, and the child is dead, then cut the hands with the knife which is shown earlier, and extract the child, and replace everything as it was.	If the hands of the foetus present, you should slowly and gently push them back; and if they will not go back then place the woman upon a seat, have her feet raised and meanwhile shake the seat; but the woman should be held lest the shaking cause her to fall off. But if the two hands will not go back and the foetus is dead cut them off and draw out the remains. Or tie tapes to the hands and pull on them evenly and it will come out.	0.88652194
of the delivery of the child feet first When the child comes feet first, you must push it up; and then turn it little by little, until it is positioned correctly; then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.

Then take one of its feet and stretch it gently.	0.8482368
When it jumps/moves up to the thighs, tell her to hold on, and make her sneeze with hellebore; then it jumps/moves out, God willing.	When they come down as far as the hips, bid her bear down, make her sneeze with ptarmica, and it will come out.	0.6115711
And if it does not come out as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is in its natural position. For then it comes out easily.	But if it will not come out with these means we have described, you should return the foetus gently until you have placed it in the natural position; then it will come out easily.	0.77172905
And if it does not come out as we have said, take mucilage of marshmallow, and sesame oil, and melted gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and put this ointment on the woman's genitals inside and outside, then make her sit in lukewarm water up to below the ribs; and when she is softened below, make a pessary of myrrh, and put it inside her, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and hold her mouth and nose, and press her belly gently, for the child will come out immediately.	But if it defies all that we have described, take mucilage of marsh mallow and fenugreek and oil of sesame and dissolved gum, and pound them all well together in the mortar and anoint the woman's pudenda and lower abdomen; then make her sit down in warm water reaching to the costal margin. And when you see the lower parts are softened, make a suppository of myrrh and let her introduce it; and when she has had the suppository in for a while make her sneeze, stopping her nose and mouth; and press gently upon the abdomen; then will the foetus immediately emerge.	0.90276086
When the child comes in this way, the midwife should put her hands there little by little; then she should be supported by her neck, with her feet hanging down, and lying on a bed; and fold her hands little by little, and then take her hands on her belly, and remove the cushions from under her, so that she is positioned downwards; and if the child does not come out, take her feet and move them strongly, then move her belly upwards, then put your hands there; and pull the child little by little; and tell the woman to push until the child comes out. of the delivery of the child who comes out sideways with one hand hanging out It is necessary to devise a way to bring back the hand: if it cannot be brought back, make the woman get up and walk; if she cannot walk, make her lie on a bed, and stretch her legs strongly; then administer the mucilage that I have described; and if she does not give birth, make her sit on a seat, then work on bringing back the hand; and pull the child according to its natural position, and make her sneeze, and tell her to push until the child comes out.	And when you see the lower parts are softened, make a suppository of myrrh and let her introduce it; and when she has had the suppository in for a while make her sneeze, stopping her nose and mouth; and press gently upon the abdomen; then will the foetus immediately emerge. Presentation of the foetus by knees and hands : when it comes out after this manner you should seek to introduce the hands slowly; then let the woman lie back on her shoulders with her feet hanging down, reclining on a couch with her hands clasped together; then very gently put pressure upon the abdomen; then take away the pillows from under her feet until her lower parts are vertical ; and if the foetus does not come out then, take both her feet and shake them violently ; then press upon her costal margin until the foetus ascends ; then let the midwife insert her hand and put the foetus in the right position, very gently, and bid the woman bear down, until the infant is born. Presentation by the side with one hand hanging down: attempt to man≈ìuvre the hand back again; but if you cannot reduce it then make the woman stand up and walk.

Then when he is in the correct position apply to the maternal passage the oil and mucilage prescribed. Then bid the woman move gently and when she has done so make her sit down upon a seat and bid her lean over to her right side; then bid her bear down, and with ptarmica make her sneeze ; then the foetus will come forth.	0.7628411
When the afterbirth comes out in this way, cut the afterbirth with your fingernail, until the moisture is drained; and if the child is hanging by its face and neck, cut it from the abdomen so that it is not retained, and the child dies; then push the child inside, until you have placed it as it should be, and tell the woman to push a few times: then it will come out easily. of the delivery of twins	The foetus presenting laterally, doubled up : when it presents at the os in this manner together with the membrane, open the membrane with your finger nail and let out the waters.

of the delivery of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, and happens rarely.	The birth of twin or multiple foetuses: you should know that it is a common occurrence for twins to be born alive, and sometimes three or four infants, but this is a rarity; while five after this manner is altogether unnatural and they never live.	0.81319326
Two is a strange thing, and they do not often live; I know this, that they are multiplied, and are separated by the membrane that divides them, which is attached to the abdomen; and sometimes they come out as naturally as one whole, as we have said.	Although they may be more than one, they are enveloped in a single membrane but separated one from the other by a dividing membrane joined to the umbilicus of each one. And when they are born they may come in the natural easy manner of a single foetus; or by any abnormal presentation such as we have described.	0.65304035
And if they come out with difficulty, treat them as we have said, and let the midwife be skillful, and do quickly and lightly what she does; and do as is best for their safe delivery. of multiple children	And if one of them be born with difficulty, presenting in some unnatural manner as described, the treatment is also as described.

Sometimes one or two or three or four or five or six or seven, or more up to fifteen, are formed in the womb, all formed in the shape of a child by the measure of the glorious sage, and the midwife must know all this, because perhaps such a thing will happen to her; let her do according to what is necessary.	Sometimes in the womb there may form one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or more than ten. And I can vouch that one woman had an abortion of seven foetuses and another woman of fifteen, all of them formed. This is by the decree of the Almighty, the Wise. And all this should be part of the midwife's knowledge, for one day she may meet such a case and she must deal with it in the proper way.	0.82677
