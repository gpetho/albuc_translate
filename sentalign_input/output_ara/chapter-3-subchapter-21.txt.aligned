On the treatment of a fracture if it has healed but the limb remains thinner than its original form.	On the treatment of a fracture when, after repair, the limb remains unnaturally thin.	0.74434626
If a bone fracture has healed but the limb remains thin and weak, it is due to many reasons. One of them is either due to repeated loosening and improper tightening of the bandages, or excessive tightening of the bandages preventing nourishment from reaching the limb, or excessive suspension, or excessive movement at the wrong time, or insufficient blood and weakness in the patient's body.	When a fractured bone has been repaired but the limb remains thin and weak, this may be due to many causes: the bandaging being too often loosened and not properly tightened; or excessive binding-up so that nourishment cannot flow to the limb; or excessive fomenting; or excessive and premature movement; or the thinness and weakness of the patient's blood.	0.8951613
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body until his blood increases, and to use the bath, and to bring him joy and happiness, and so forth. Then, apply tar to the limb so that the tar draws much nourishment to it, or continuously suspend it in lukewarm water. Until nourishment flows into it and it returns to its natural form.	The treatment of this consists in the nourishing and restoring of his body so there be plenty of blood; and the use of the bath; and cheering the patient and making him happy, and so on. Then apply pitch to the limb so that it may draw much nourishment to itself, or continue the massage to the limb with tepid water, so that nourishment flows in the limb and it returns to its normal shape.	0.9219955
