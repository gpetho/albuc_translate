of dropsy
Cautery is not useful for dropsy, except in the manner which is called "ascites".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in divisions, and your treatment is not effective, then you must make four cauteries around the groin, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two behind the back on the spine, and one near the chest; and the cautery should be very close to the thickness of the skin.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to drain pus for a long time, and do not abandon the treatment of the patient after the cautery; and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be combined with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the key-shaped one that we have previously shown; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what has been stated before.
