of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh inside is softened, and it is pale to look at; and it is necessary, when one wants to treat it, to make the patient lie on his back, and cut the skin which is softened over the natural skin; then bring the two edges together with a suture, and if you wish, first sew the excess of softened skin with three or four stitches firmly; then cut between the stitches, and treat it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
