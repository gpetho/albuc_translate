On Returning the Nasal Septum.	On turning a fistula into the nose.	0.5788294
Physicians call the septum a fistula. If you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medication, as described previously, and it does not heal, then there is no recourse but to incise the swelling when it is ripe and extract all the moisture or pus that is in it.	Doctors give the name 'fistula' to what laymen call 'a quill'. When you have treated it with the cautery or with caustic according to the instructions given previously, and it is not healed, there is no clear method of treatment except to cut down on the tumour at its ripening and let out all the humidity or pus therein, till you reach the bone.	0.8167511
Until the bone is exposed. And when the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument like this:	When bone is reached and you see necrosis or blackness, scrape it with an instrument like this.	0.65096533
It is called the rough-headed one; it is made from Indian steel, and its head is round like a button, finely engraved like a file or scraper.  Place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, while you tighten your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away.	It is called 'rough-head' and is made of Indian iron. Its head is round like a button but is engraved with markings finely engraved, like those of a file or a rasp. Place it on the site of the diseased bone and spin it between your fingers, pressing down a little with your hand, till you are sure all the diseased bone has been scraped away.	0.90411973
Do this several times, then dress the area with desiccating, astringent medications. If the area heals over and flesh grows in it and the discharge stops, and this remains for forty days, and it does not recur, and there is no swelling, and no incident occurs,	Do this several times. Then let the place be dressed with stanching and styptic remedies. And if the place heals and flesh is generated there and the flow of sanies is stayed and there is no return after leaving for forty days, and there is no swelling, and nothing emerges, you may know it is perfectly healed.	0.8615884
then know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no recourse but to return the fistula to the nostril in this way: you must expose the bone again with an iron instrument or with a sharp medication. When the bone is exposed, take a probe shaped like this:	But if not, there is no other means for it but to turn the fistula into the cavity of the nose, in this style, namely, that you lay bare the bone a second time, either by an instrument or by caustic; and when the bone is uncovered, then take a drill like this.	0.77366024
The tip of the instrument should be triangular, and its shaft conical, tapering towards the tip as you see.  Then place it on the bone itself, close to the nostril, and move your hand slightly away from the eye. Then turn your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it.	Its extremity, which is of iron, should be triangular; and its wooden handle should be conical in shape, and, as you see, tapering to the extremity. Then put it to the bone itself near the canthus; but keep your hand a little away from the eye; then with your hand rotate the drill till the bone is perforated; and the patient will have the sensation of this, since, if he holds his hands over his nose he will find the breath coming out through the hole.	0.82528794
He will notice air coming out of it if he holds his hand over his nose. At that point, dress the area with astringent, desiccating medications as I have taught you. When the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter that was draining outwards will return to the nose, and this will be less distressing for the patient, God willing.	And then dress the place with styptic and stanching remedies as I have taught you. And when the flesh begins to grow and the place gets hard, the matter which before was coming outward will be turned into the nose; and this will be easier for the patient.	0.69446236
