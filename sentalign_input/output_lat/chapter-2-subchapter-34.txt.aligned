On incising the ligament below the tongue which is an impediment to speech. Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural and congenital; or it may be accidental, owing to scarring from an injury.	Occasionally, the lingual frenulum (the tissue under the tongue) may either be a congenital condition with which a person is born or arise from a wound that has healed improperly.	0.7255553
The operation for it is to open the patient's mouth, having his head in your lap, and lift his tongue; then cut that sinew-like ligament transversely till the tongue is freed from its hold.	The procedure involves opening the patientâ€™s mouth with their head resting against your chest, lifting the tongue, and then cutting across the fibrous frenulum until the tongue is freed from its restriction.	0.8065785
If it is hard and nodular, arising from scarring after an injury, catch it with a hook and slit it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots undone.	If there is a hardening or nodule caused by scar tissue, insert a small hook and cut across it until the frenulum is divided and the nodule released.	0.62695485
Beware of making the incision deeply into the flesh, or you may cut an artery there and haemorrhage may occur.	Be careful not to cut too deeply into the tissue to avoid severing an artery, which would result in heavy bleeding.	0.8008481

Then put under the tongue a pad of linen, which the patient must keep in position at night to prevent the adhesion from forming again.	Place a small piece of linen under the tongue, which the patient should hold there each night to prevent reattachment.	0.8027055
If there should be haemorrhage, put pounded vitriol on the place; and if bleeding still prevails burn the spot with a lenticular cautery of suitable size and treat in the usual way till healed.	If the bleeding persists, cauterize the area with a suitable gentle cautery. Then treat the wound with appropriate care until it heals.	0.7188989
