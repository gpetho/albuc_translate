Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After completing for you, O Sons, this book which is the last in the science of medicine along with its complement, and having reached the end of it through expositions and declarations thereof, it appeared to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since operation with the hand is laid low in our region and during our time entirely unavailable; until perhaps it has perished altogether along with its knowledge, and the trace of it has vanished; and only small descriptions of it remain in the books of old, which have been changed by hands; and error and hesitation occurred to them, causing their intentions to be enclosed and the force of it to be elongated: It appeared to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise according to the way from expositions, declarations, and abbreviation; and that I should come with forms of iron tools of Cautery and other instruments of work; with a declaration's addition and with proper consideration for what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why a good craftsman of this art is not found with his hand in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained before that in the science of anatomy, as Galen narrated, until he knows the remedies for limbs, their shapes, their connection and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, and their number, their exit points, the pulses of veins and arteries, and their resting places; and the locations where they emerge.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And for this reason, Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and work is little, especially in the art of hands.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already said about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Because whoever is not learned about what we have said concerning anatomy, will not be able to avoid falling into error, in which people are killed: as I have seen many of those who are formed from this science and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 What is more, I have seen a foolish doctor cut an aposteme from the neck of a woman and he cut some arteries at her neck; therefore, the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 I have also seen another doctor who presumed to extract a stone from an old man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore he went to him, and extracted it with a piece of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Thus the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And indeed I had been called to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the man that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 I have also seen another doctor who was receiving a staff at a certain Duke of our land because of medicine; and a black eunuch was with him, who had a fracture near his heel; and the doctor with his ignorance strung the fracture on a wound with pulleys and strong bands, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he closed it according to his own devices.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Afterwards he let him go for a few days and ordered him not to loosen the band; and he stood like that until an aposteme grew on his leg, and his foot; and he came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 I was then called to him; and I hurried to loosen the band; and calm came over him, and he was released from his pain.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 The corruption had already been confirmed in the member; and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Stop, the corruption has stopped walking around in the member, until it perishes.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous boil; and it healed after days, until the malignancy of its master was revealed along with him.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 Because when the cancer is pure from black bile, then it is not necessary to reach for it with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can tolerate it, so that the entire thing may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And because of that [saying], O Sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation is divided into two divisions; namely, an operation associated with health; and an operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already aroused myself in every place of this book where the operation comes, in which there is fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore, it is necessary for you to be cautious about it and divide it so that fools do not find a way to speak and disgrace themselves.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Take the measure with care and protection, and treat your weak ones with ease and firmness, and use a better way leading by the grace of God to salvation and praiseworthy success; and dismiss the dreadful illnesses difficult to cure; and free your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation enters upon you in your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your profit.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 Galenus said it in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not treat an evil illness, lest you be called an evil physician.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters. ¶
Capitulum primum.	 Chapter one.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 On Cautery with fire, and Cautery with sharp medicine, this chapter is dedicated, and it is ordered from head to foot, and the shapes of instruments, and tools for Cautery, and everything necessary for the operation. (¶ denotes a new topic or paragraph)
Capitulum secundum.	 De purgatione venae cum igne calido et medicina acuta
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 On purging a vein with hot fire and sharp medicine, chapter two is dedicated. It covers sectioning, perforation, phlebotomy, and ventosis; wounds; extraction of arrows and similar objects, and everything concerning the shapes of instruments. (¶ denotes a new topic or paragraph)
Capitulum tertium.	 De uulneribus a bestiis feris et hominibus inf
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 On wounds inflicted by wild animals and men, chapter three is dedicated. It covers restoration, dislocation, cure for twisting, and similar issues; from head to foot, and the shapes of instruments. (This seems to be an incomplete sentence.)
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be the glory. (This is a common Latin phrase that signifies hum
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 On the benefits and harm of cautery, when it should be used and at what time; and whether with iron or gold. (¶ denotes a new topic or paragraph)
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 But first, before discussing the operations with it, it is necessary to explain the benefits and harm of it, and under what circumstances it should be applied. (This seems to be an incomplete sentence.)
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 I say that the discussion of the quality of the benefit and harm of cautery is a long, subtle, scientific, and hidden discourse. (This seems to be an incomplete sentence.)
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Moreover, a great number of wise men have spoken about it and have disagreed; and for me, enough is said from their discussions, fearing prolongation. (This seems to be an incomplete sentence.)
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 I say that cautery is suitable for every circumstance, whether with matter or without matter; except for two circumstances, which are a hot dry condition without matter, and a dry cold condition without matter. (This seems to be an incomplete sentence.)
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 In a hot and dry composition, matter has separated.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some say that the beneficial cautery is in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others have said the opposite of that, namely that cautery is not suitable in the disease which is due to heat and dryness: because fire is warmth; it is inconvenient to be healed from a hot and dry disease by what is warm and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who says the opposite of that has said: that by cautery there is benefit in every hot and dry disease which happens in human bodies: because when you compare a man's body and his humors to fire, you find a man's body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I myself say by that speech: because from experience it has often been demonstrated to me.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 Nevertheless, it is not appropriate for that to come about unless he who has been proven and trained in the chapter of cautery's practice at the end, and knows the differences in human compositions, and the dispositions of diseases in themselves, and their causes, and their symptoms, and the time periods of these.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 As for the remaining compositions, there is no fear over you; and especially in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 For now all physicians agree on these: and they have not separated in benefit with cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, sons, that from the secret of healing with cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with medicine burning, is that fire is simple, whose action does not extend beyond the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm another joint connected with it, unless minor damage.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 But the action of burning medicine extends to what is distant from members: and perhaps it causes difficult healing disease in the member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 Fire, on account of its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do that unless it is in excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 It has become known to us through experience, on account of the length of servitude and study required with art, and because of its truth-station: and on that account I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would reveal to you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies by which it expels illnesses, demonstrated by philosophical speech which would be understood by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, sons, that they themselves differ as to the time when a cautery should be made, and they set a better time for truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that a cautery is fitting at any time: therefore because the harm resulting from time is submerged in the help which is attracted by the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if the cautery is for pains resulting from necessary, strong, urgent pains that do not bear delay: therefore because it is feared that from these there may occur a greater evil which would exceed the small harm caused by time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And that may not occur to your minds, sons, that it is not thought by anyone except the common people and foolish doctors, namely that there is no return for an illness which is cured by cautery: and they put this consequence, and things are not as they think: therefore because cautery is not, unless in place of medicine, which changes complexion, and expels humidities which are the causes, wherefore pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 However, the cautery is superfluous over medicine on account of the swiftness of its health, and the virtue of its operation, and the violence of its rule: and it is possible that an illness returns at some hour of time according to the complexion of the sick person, and the location of his illness, and the power of its action: and that it prepares in his body from accumulations in it: and that it comes to him from food and similar things from the causes, unless an illness occurs for which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle ailment in the member of few superfluidities and humidities, like cauterization of a tooth, due to pain, and similar to it, is possible, for it may not return into him that pain.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 That occurs in a few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 But indeed the common speech, that cautery is the last remedy, is true: not regarding what they intend in it, since they believe that there is no cure given with medicine nor with anything after the fall of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 But the fact is contrary to theirs, and their intent, that cautery is the last remedy, is not, unless when we administer modes of treatment in any ailment, and they do not give such cure with medicine: then we administer cautery at the end, and it cures: thence comes the notion that cautery is the last remedy, not according to their understanding as the common people and most foolish doctors.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this except for the equality of gold, and the subtlety of its substance; and they said that it does not make a place for cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 But that is not absolutely true; because I have already proven it, and I found that it does not do this in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And indeed cautery with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 But indeed when you fire cautery in a fire from gold, it is not manifested to you when heated according to the amount that you wish, due to the redness of gold; and when it approaches the heat, and if you add more heat to it, it liquefies in the fire, and turns into layers.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore the craftsman falls from that occupation; and for this reason we use cautery with iron among us more quickly and closely to the operation, for rightness in the work.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 I have already arranged this Chapter in Cautery, according to the chapters: and I have arranged it from head to feet: so that it may be relieved for whoever seeks what he wants from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 On the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 Here is the cauterization for mastery of humidity and coldness on the brain: these are the two causes of soda (seizures), and the flow of many fluids from the head to the eyes and ears, and the multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain: and universally all illness that happens due to coldness, such as paralysis, and soda (seizures), epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar conditions.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the sick person: to evacuate first with purifying medicine washing the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then instruct him to rub his head with a new linen cloth.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then make him sit between your hands in a square shape, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the palm of your hand on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with an unburned (cauterized) mark.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then heat the cautery oil: of which this is the form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then place it (the cautery) on the marked spot without burning, while gradually pressing with your hand, and you turn it around.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Lift your hand quickly, and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that a piece of bone or pieces of hair have come out from the skull, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, press your hand with the iron itself or with another if it becomes cold: until the bones that I told you appear.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, dip the cloth in it, and place it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place on top of it a wet cloth in butter, and let it remain until the burn is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with four-ingredient ointment, until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 It is said that the larger the wound remains open, the more pus it discharges; therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 Some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone; and the cautery must be held until something of the bone's thickness is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then grind away what has been burnt from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 Others say that when the cautery reaches the bone, an impression should be made on it for as long as the bone falls off, so that the shape of a corkscrew is formed; or an instrument similar to what women use to insert when they alphabetize letters, and they believe that vapors from the head are released from this place, and the wound should be kept open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then treat it until it solidifies.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 But I do not see these two types of cautery at all, except in certain humans according to the path of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And let it be, it is better for its safety with me.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 The head weakens from the solution of its own continuity; as we have been witnesses in other members; and especially when the head is naturally weak; the first type of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it; so operate with it for safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 Chapter on cauterizing the head when there is pain in the whole head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When a chronic pain occurs throughout the head, and it persists in the weak, and uses warm baths, and leeching, and purges, and oils, and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And especially if it has already been cauterized with one iron as we have said, and it does not help him with any of these, then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If the head of the weak is strong by nature and not frail, and finds a violent cold, then cauterize it with another iron, but only slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize it over the entire horn of his head with iron, so that the skin is not penetrated and a quantity from the bone, as we have said, is exposed.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And cauterize it with one iron at the occiput of his head, in a place called vasa: and it is a place where air is placed: pour your oil into this, and do not expose bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 The weak finds it because of that violent pain, and different from the pain of all other cauterizations of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I say that this cautery is in its place, and it should be a cautery for the horns of the head and the occiput more subtle than the cautery used for the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Chapter on the mode of cauterizing a hemiplegia, both with hot medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When there is pain and swelling in part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is cleansed with purifying medicines, and further treatment is given as I said in the divisions of diseases, but it does not help completely, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with hot medicine burning, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The cautery with a burning medicine is to take one garlic clove, peel it, and cut off the ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then divide the painful area at the time with a wide lancet until there is a place under the skin where the tooth is captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Insert it into the same place under the skin until it is hidden; then bind over it with a suitable bandage and leave it for fifteen hours; then dissolve it and extract the garlic; leave the wound open for two or three days; afterwards, put a warm poultice soaked in butter on it until a pus forms; then treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to do this with certain burning medications as I wrote in the twelfth treatise on poisons.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 The cauterization of this is as follows:
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 Hot Iron Cautery, whose shape is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 Claw-shaped Cautery (also known as Clavilatus): because the head of it is shaped like a nail, having a small notch, and there is a small projection in the middle.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the location and hold your hand; and you pull the iron slowly but quickly; and the quantity that is to be cauterized should be as thick as the skin itself, half of which.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And lift your hand so that an artery, which is below, is not burned and blood flow occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then immerse the wool in water with salt and place it on the location for three days; then immerse the wool with butter, afterwards heal it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, cauterize this hemiplegia with the tip of a second Cautery (also known as bistoury).
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 Be careful not to cut an artery in this hemiplegia, not an old one specifically.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 § Method of Cauterizing in Old Hemiplegia.
Caput V.	 Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you treat hemiplegia, as we said in the previous treatment and what we said in the division of diseases, and healing does not help; and you see from the disease that the first cautery with medicine, or the cautery with fire, did not suffice, then it is necessary to heat a claw-shaped Cautery until it becomes white after marking the location of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that; and place your hand once, and press it until you cut the artery, and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to burn the cheek that moves during chewing, so that the side or nerve that moves it does not get burned, thus causing a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And it should be regarding the care and caution for the flow of blood from an artery that has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 For indeed, in its cutting there is fear, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not careful, nor experienced. And it dismisses the operation first with such a person.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I shall come with the reminder of the management of the flow of blood following the rupture of an artery according to its own method and in its place within this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you see from the illness that this cautery does not suffice for him, and you see the body of a weak person tolerating cauterization in the middle of the head as we have said, care for the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you wish, administer the cautery as we have said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 For indeed, cauterization is better and more advantageous in this way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing pain in the ear.
Caput VI.	 Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with solvents, and other treatment as we have said in division, but the pain does not disappear, then cauterize with fire. And this is what is called Punctum, whose form is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then the punctum is made with it after its ignition all around the ear as it revolves; or around each of them if pain is on both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And move away from the root of the ear with the cautery a little after marking the places with enkaustricum; and let the quantity of the cautery be ten punctums in every ear, and like that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then care for the places until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in torture.
Caput VII.	 Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 The torture that is cured with cauterization, is not other than those which occur by phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 Avoid cauterizing species that occur from excision, and also from spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When you treat this species of torture with leeches, purging, and gargles, and your treatment does not bring improvement, then it is necessary that you cauterize the sick person with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and second slightly below its time, and third at the junction of two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 Place your cautery from the weak side of the sick part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Since softening does not occur except in the healthy part.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize yourself with the cautery directly on the upper part of the ear at the very tip below the horn of the head a little: and another in the time, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And place your hand with the cautery until the thickness of half the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of the cautery and it is a species from the knife, whose shape has been previously stated: however, it should not be too fine as you can see: and it is necessary that the knife be in it of excessively large thickness a little.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then treat the place with what preceded until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 WHEN old apoplexy occurs and your treatment with what we said does not bring improvement, and the sick person does not have a fever, THEN CAUTERIZE HIM WITH FOUR CAUTERIES ON EVERY CORNUS OF HIS OWN HEAD, AND WITH A CAUTERY IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS HEAD, AS WE SAID, AND WITH A CAUTERY AT THE BASE OF HIS HEAD, ACCORDING TO WHAT PRECEDDED: AND THE FORM OF CAUTERIZATION SHOULD BE ACCORDING TO WHAT WAS STATED.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Also cauterized on the face of the stomach with a Cautery; and it is more extreme.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then it is cured, with what went before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	 On the method of cauterizing in Oblivion.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 It is necessary that for the sick there be given first large onions (hyerae), and cleansing pills for the brain (pillulae mundificantes cerebrum).
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then shave the head of the sick person completely, and place on his scalp an ointment made from synapi, as described in the treatise on ointments; and place it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 For that is the method of cauterization; and make it according to the same order as I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If therefore he recovers through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not: then make three cauteries on the back of his head, which shall be descending from the top of his head to the lower part of his eye; and place between every cautery a thickness equal to a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then treat the cauteries, with what went before.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If you wish an additional treatment, and the sick person is able to bear it; then make a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 If you wish an additional treatment; then cauterize him on both horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then treat him until he recovers; and let the cautery be oiled according to the shape that was given before.

Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	 It is necessary to proceed with cleansing the head with onions, and with what was said before.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 Then shave the head of the sick person; then cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of his head, and on every horn of his head, and on the back of his neck, and three on his spine.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If however you require the body to be softened in sickness by several of those, and the patient is weak and enduring, and the sickness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries upon the dorsal vertebrae, and the last one with a cautery, until he is burned most from his skin, and you pull your hand away.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then treat him until he is cured: thus cauterize with Olive oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 An epileptic is not cauterized unless his epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore, it is necessary to clean his brain first with hyssop and the rest of the treatment as we have said in the division; when he is very weak or enduring in taking medications.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 If he is a child who cannot endure medications, then give him gargarism and mouthwashes that clean the brain; beforehand for many days with purifying food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the skull, according to what has been said before; and another cautery on the occiput, and over all the horns of the skull with a cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 If he is strong and enduring, then cauterize him with the cauteries as I have said in treating paralysis, and softening of the body upon the vertebrae of the neck and back; and let it be cauterized with olive oil according to the method that has been said before.

Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	 When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries as I have said in treating paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause is excess of melancholy leading to melancholy, and the body is weakened and damp, then give him a drink that cleanses his brain, as specified in the previous division; then shave the head of the sick person, and make afterwards a well-formed bandage like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it in the middle of the head: and the sick person sitting squarely should be held from all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Then apply a liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 It is more suitable from ancient butter from sheep.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	 And heat it over a gentle fire, with a measured warmth that the finger can bear when inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	 Then evacuate it on the head of the sick person in a circle and let it remain until it cools.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	 Do this to the sick person once a week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	 Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small holes in it, but keep your hand with the cautery; let it be fragrant.

Caput XIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	 When you are informed about the beginning of water in the eye through signs mentioned in the division, then begin and give a drink to the sick person, along with what cleanses his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And keep him away from all moisture and make him sit in the bath for a few days while fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then order him to shave his head and cauterize it in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then cauterize it on two sides with two cauteries, if the descent of water is blocked in both eyes at the same time; or from one side, if the descent of water is blocked in one eye; and cut off with the cautery all veins and arteries that are under the skin; and let the cauterias be long in the width of the temples; and be careful not to cause bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 If you see anything from that, then cut it off immediately with any medicine that is possible; and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their dissection, and precaution against bleeding.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 When the tears of the eyes are ancient and persistent, being above veins and arteries that are manifest on the outside of the head, it is verified that this is due to an excess of cold phlegmatic humors; then cauterize with the same cautery as I described in the beginning about descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the temples, and two cauteries in the neck under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if you need additional treatment, then cauterize it carefully on all sides of the eye, above the eyelid extension with a small cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in nasal foul smell.

When you treat it, as we said in the division, and the medicine does not work: then hasten, and give for three nights infirmocochias in drink: then shave his head, and cauterize it with a middle cautery, with the cautery oliuari.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	 Then cauterize it with two cauteries and a clavius cautery, on top of the eyebrows under the hair slightly.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	 And beware of the artery, lest you cut it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	 And this is the form of the clavius cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	 § On the method of cauterizing in softening the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	 Head XVI.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	 When the eyelid of the eye is softened by sickness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this cautery lunare.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if you wish, cauterize it above the eyebrows slightly with two cauteries in all places; and they should extend from both temples; and let the length of the entire cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not place your hand with the cautery at the very end, rather according to the amount that is burned by the third eyelash.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	 And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of the lunare cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 § On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are turned upwards and prick the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Head XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 The cautery is in this two ways: either a cautery with fire; or a cautery with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 In the cautery with fire, instruct the sick one beforehand to release his hairs, if he is among those who wash them, until they are extended and aligned.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If however they prick him at the root: then constrain his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move, until new ones grow.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When they are born and become equal (in size), then place the head of the weak one in your lap; afterwards mark a sign on the eyelids of his eyes with hot wax, a sign which is in the shape of a myrtle leaf; let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then place a wet cloth on the egg white or on the eye, or apply slippery elm poultice to the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then heat an instrument with fire, which has this shape (a trephine or surgical drill).
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize gradually, in several places where you have marked, until the surface of the skin burns, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, completely appearing.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And the mark of the success of your work is that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting and hairs rising up at the corner of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then lift your hand (away), and release him for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then place a warm cloth with butter over it until the scab falls off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If a hair grows back after an hour and the eyelid becomes soft again, then repeat the cautery on that spot, as you did initially.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If however hairs are below (in the lower lid), then cauterize it until they rise up to their natural position and do not irritate the eye by growing into it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	 [Section heading: The manner of cauterizing when using a burning medicine in the same case.]
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 It is necessary to instruct the weak one to pluck out his hairs until they grow longer and become equal.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make a parchment in the shape of a myrtle leaf from linen cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take some soap that is known and plaster that has not been soaked from one source or the other (equal weights of both), then grind them together with good pressure, but quickly, so it does not get cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then take that (object) and place it on the cloth you have made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and put it upon one or both eyelids.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 Then place under the eye a swab soaked in egg white: and let the head of the sick be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 Place your index finger upon the medicine and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 You move (the swab) whenever the sick person feels a bite from the medicine, because its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While this persists and it continues to feel a bite from the medicine, then release the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When the bite ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 Then consider whether the eyelid rises as it does when heated by fire or cut: if so, it is good; and if not, then repeat the application of medicine over the place where the medicine does not press and does not discolor, until your operation is complete and the eyelid contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then place (the swab) over it with butter until the charred skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with diaphine ointment or another ointment until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 It is necessary for you during the operation that you keep the last guard, lest anything fall from the medicine into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid becomes softened after days and something comes out of the hair into the eye from that place, then repeat the medicine over that place which has become softened from the eyelid, just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that human eyes differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the path of righteousness shall not be concealed to him who is devoted to this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 On the method of cauterizing in the lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When you treat the fistula, if, as we said in our discussion of diseases, your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Command the sick man to place his head on your lap, and let one of his attendants hold his head between his own hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then put cotton soaked in olive oil or psyllium mucilage on his eye: then place the cautery iron over it, which has this shape.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 It should be concave, like the form of a bird's feather quill from one end, with which the cautery iron is made: and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to extend upward in this manner.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, a concave one is better for your purpose.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then, if the fistula is open, unblock it and drain the pus from it, and then excise it: and if it is not open, then open it and drain its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place the hot cautery iron on it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand near the cautery iron for a little while by the eye, at the side of the nose, so that your hand does not stray or shake the sick man: and you will place the cautery iron on the fat of the eye and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If you reach to the beginning of your cautery as far as the bone, that is good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, as needed; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place the wound with butter, and care for it with an antiseptic ointment until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 If it goes beyond forty days and does not heal, then place a sharp corrosive medicine on top of it until the bone appears: and shave it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the first ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Approach the place of the fistula and find it: then put a fine cannula into the opening, that is, a thin cannula whose shape is as follows.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 Pour in it a quantity of drachmas of liquid lead, and hold your hand with the cannula's retention good, and do not let it move at all, so that the liquid lead does not run or reach its eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 It is necessary that you place a warm poultice on the eye of the sick person in egg white or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns the place of the fistula and heals it by a wonderful healing process.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula heals with what we said about cauterizing, and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 If not, then it is necessary to open the nose hole and redirect the fistula towards the nostril, according to its own place.

Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	 Many times fissures occur in the lip, which are called "Pili", and especially in children's lips.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 When you care for these fissures, as we said in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not help, then use a small cautery iron shaped like this.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 The depression of it (the instrument) should be according to the subtlety of a knife's edge.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place it (the hot cautery) hastily into the splits (wounds), until the cautery reaches the depth of the splits (wounds).
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it (the wound) with ointment, until it is healed.

When an abscess occurs at the root of the gingiva (gums), or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus and bursts: afterwards it becomes old, and the pus runs and becomes a fistula: then take care of it and do not apply treatment to it, then if it does not heal, as required, it is necessary that you heat cauterization according to its quantity, which can be absorbed in the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then insert the heated metal (cauterization) into the hole of the fistula and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its depth and its end; do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then take care of it afterwards, with what I said about treatment, until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If therefore the pus separates and heals, it will be good (favorable).
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the rotten bone according to its size.

When the gums become soft due to moisture and the teeth move, and treatment with medicine does not help; then put the head of a sick person on your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then heat the cauterization whose form will come later; so that you place a cannula over a tooth and insert the heated cauterization quickly into it: and hold your hand for a while until the sick person feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And lift your hand: then apply the cauterization several times as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Then let the sick person fill his own wound with salt water and hold it for an hour: and rinse it.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 Teeth that move are made firm, and softened gums are tightened and dried out the rotten moisture.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 On the method of cauterizing tooth pain.
Caput XXIII.	 In capite dentium exterius demodis et interd
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 Chapter XXIII (Head of teeth) on external and internal diseases of the teeth, and their cure. When toothache is due to cold or there is coldness in it, or worms, and no medicine brings relief: then Cautery is used on it according to two methods: either Cautery with butter; or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The cauterization with butter is as follows: Take lard (butter) and boil it in a cast-iron or copper pot.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then receive the cup and turn it over on the end of the incision.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then immerse it in melted butter and place it on the painful tooth quickly and hold it until it cools; then repeat it several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if you want, immerse wool or a cup in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth; then place hot iron on top of it until the heat reaches the depth of the hollow part of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 The cauterization of this, with fire, is to aim at the brass tube or iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 And let there be something bulky in his body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the weak bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then apply the cauterizer (Cautery) with fire and shape it; place it on the tooth and hold your hand until it cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Do this several times as the pain will subside either on the same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 And when applying the impression of the cautery, the weakened bone must be filled with good butter and held for an hour; then it should be spat out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Cauterize with whichever end you wish, depending on what is possible; and this is the shape of the tube.

Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	 When Warts are from phlegm and from cold moistness, and they do not obey digestion through medicines, and they desire rapid digestion: then to the Curved Cautery, whose shape is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open ends so that the smoke may exit at the Cautery from one end: and place it heated upon the ulcer once, and again, if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the ulcer.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the ulcer is small: then place the Cautery according to the size of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then let it rest for three days, and place upon it a dish of warm butter soaked until what the fire has burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 Then care for it with tooth ointment until the form of the pipe (cannula) heals.

Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	 When moisture accumulates on the windpipe (trachea), especially when it is accompanied by coldness of complexion, then it is necessary to first remove the weakened one with dissolving medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 Then cauterize it (the windpipe) in the neck at the root of the throat in a hollow place depressed: and be careful not to reach with the Cautery at the throat or skin unless something of that area is present.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 Then cauterize it (the windpipe) with another cautery at the juncture of the neck in the last rib of that place: and let the Cautery be square-shaped according to the method previously described.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what was previously mentioned until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	 On the method of cauterizing in diseases of the lungs and cough.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	 When cough and sickness of the lungs are from cold moistures, and the person is not feverish, nor consumption, and the sickness is old: then cauterize it with two cauteries above the collarbone in depressed, gentle, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 With another caution on the middle of the chest between two breasts: and let the caution be of the tube shape, as was before.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 And if your caution is to be by pricking with the caution called "Punctum", whose shape was before in the pricking of ear pain: and let the pricks be from thirty up to as many more.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with what was before until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 And now let the caution have three branches: according to this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 Therefore let the caution be applied when you are using it instead of three cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	 § On the method of cauterizing in the Tilt (Titillico), in the dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 When the head is dislocated due to assistance and it does not heal within an hour of its return from the dislocation, until such a habit of returning has been established for it, then it should be dislocated slightly as a result of a small movement that occurs just as we have already testified about this. Then you must reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the sick person lies down on his back or on the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then peel off the skin that is on the inner side of the Tilt (Titillico) towards the top with your left hand fingers: and if there is a fusion in the internal parts.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 Then heat the cautery with two openings.
Cuius forma est haec.	 Its shape is as follows: (Drawing not included, but it is described as a "T
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates through to the other side and forms the shape of the cauterization with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And sometimes there is cauterization with a cautery having three prongs, for which the figure of cauterization becomes that of six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the subtlety sought.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 Here is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 And sometimes an additional one is added to it, for which there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	 Then place upon the cautery bent rods with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	 Then make the patient to adhere to calmness, so that a limb is not moved during any time, until it recovers.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 And if there is a dislocation toward the upper part, which rarely occurs, then cauterize it on the shoulder with an angled cautery or with many pointed cauteries.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	 For union strengthens, and moisture is removed: and the sick person recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	 When coldness and many moistures occur in the stomach until it is separated from its composition, and catarrhs multiply on it, and continuous methods of treatment do not help: then the patient should lie down on his back, spread out his legs, and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then cauterize with three cauteries: one angled cautery of the size of a finger under the navel of the chest, and two cauteries below on each side of the one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And extend them apart so that they do not join together, when pus will form.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 And the depth of the cautery should be the size of two thirds of a finger thickness of skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 And the figure of the cauteries should be according to this shape without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape: and let the cautery used for this cauterization be one according to the shape of a circle according to this shape.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 The stomach is to be cauterized by piercing it with a probe for those who fear the cautery; and this should be done by making marks on the stomach in proportion to the size desired with an encaustic iron, then cauterize that spot with the point of the cautery; then care for it with the preceding cure until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	 The method for cauterizing a hernia (epar) coldly.

Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 When pain occurs in the hernia (epar) due to coldness and moistness, or from a large wind that cannot be expelled naturally through its own expulsion and the patient is ill and not cured by what has been said; then the patient should lie down on his neck, and make three marks with an encaustic iron on the hernia in this manner and this size, below the hypogastrium, where the human arm reaches; and let the space between each cauterization be according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cauterization be according to the length of the body straightly; and do not press your hand with the cautery too tightly.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the size of what is being cauterized be according to the thickness of the skin, without adding its half; and let the patient stand on his own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 But if he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 It is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-shaped cautery when you have subtlety and wisdom in your art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 And take care not to proceed too deeply in the cauterization, and when the thickness of the skin is being cauterized, the whole body is being cauterized; therefore it reaches the intestines, because the skin there is subtle; therefore know this.

Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 When it is required to know if an abscess is in the liver flesh or its covering, and if it is in the liver flesh, there is a dull pain and heaviness without sharpness; but if it is in the liver covering, there is intense pain with sharpness. And now you see that the treatment of this abscess has exhausted the physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 The sick person should therefore lie down with his head on his chest.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then, make the position of the lancet and apply encaustum (hot wax). Then, heat the cautery resembling a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And cauterize it with one cautery until the entire skin is burnt and reaches the flesh, so that all pus comes out; then care for it with healing until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And one should not use this cauterization method, unless his interest in the art of medicine is prolonged; and for whose hands these diseases are often associated with experience: then he dares to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 But rather, I prefer to release it myself.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Head, Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 Ancients said that cautery with the roots of arnica to the lungs in this way: cold method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is to receive from the dry roots of arnica, one longer root which can be found thereof, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil, and ignite it.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize with one hot iron in that which is between the continuation of the clavicle with the neck, and with two small irons below at the place that is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two irons also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly downward towards the back, and with another iron in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three irons from behind: one in that which is between the two scapulas; and with two irons on the sides of the chest, below an iron which is between the two scapulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it is not necessary to press your hand with the iron, on the contrary, let it be in open air smelling of skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And some ancients said that there are men who use an iron similar to a probe and heat it up, and they put it inside where the ribs are until they reach the abscess with it, and the pus exits; as we said in the case of the liver abscess.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this puncturing with the iron there is fear, because either the weak person immediately dies, or a fistula occurs at the place from which there is no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the spleen: XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you treat the sickness of the spleen, as we said in the treatment of diseases and your treatment does not help, then there is cauterization of it according to three methods, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One of them is to make three or four cauteries in the shape of the cauterizations of the liver, where the figure of the liver's cauterization precedes, along its length.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let every cautery have a thickness equal to that of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 The mode of the cautery we mentioned in the liver cautery should be the same.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press your hand with the cautery; let him who is being cauterized lie weakened on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method for cauterization is to have the cautery with two holes and apply it as we said in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus: and lift up the skin that is directly on the spleen, where the elbow of the weakened left arm reaches: and your lifting should be such that you lift the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert two holes with very hot fire until they penetrate the skin on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you wish to cauterize using a cautery with three holes.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then take care of the cautery after releasing it, let it expel pus for many days; for this is more beneficial than the rest that preceded in treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Chapter on the mode of cauterization in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 Cautery does not fall into Hydropisis, unless properly ascliti.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you treat a Hydropic (patient), with the methods of treatment as we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not bring improvement, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries around the umbilicus, and with one caution on the stomach, and another on the epar, and another on the spleen, and two cauteries behind (him), between the vertebrae, and one in front of the chest, and another in front of the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then let the open cautery (be left) so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not evacuate the sick person after cautery along with him, for it is necessary that two intentions are applied to him: and healing will hasten towards him with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be in the shape of a nail: according to its previous form: and that with which the back is cauterized, should be in the shape of an oil flask according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing Feet and Legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XLII.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When they are amputated in a Hydropic (patient), and filled with citron water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot in the navicular bone, which is between the auricular and annular bones: and lift your hand with the cautioner, but do not twist it: then lift your hand again: and do not return to him at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 For citron water will flow out, and let the cautery be in this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be with the tip of a lancet-shaped cautioner: and let the cautery be along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another further down, about halfway along the leg: and over the whole hip make two cauteries: and leave the open cautery for a long time without treatment so that some water flows out from it: then treat him as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 Method of cauterizing in the solution of the abdomen.
Caput XXXV.	 Head XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 If the solution of the abdomen is caused by cold and humidity, until it weakens the powers retained and digestive, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with methods of treatment, but not healed: and you see a patient tolerating an excessive amount of cauterization due to strong powers, then cauterize it with a large cautery over the stomach, as was done in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the umbilicus, with a subtle cautery on the clavicle, and a large cautery or two cauteries over the alcatin upon the flanks, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 And if you see excessive humidity and a patient tolerating it, then cauterize it with a large cautery over the breastbone, and a large cautery over the entire ilium: perhaps you will add two small cauteries near the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 For indeed the treatment is progressing, whose help is not in vain.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 Method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Head XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are of thick, cold, or corrupted fluids, and are treated as we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize three times on the lower part of the backbone slightly triangularly below the almeidati, and cauterize under the navel about two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If you think that his stomach is chilled and food does not digest properly, and you see his face turning pale, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, as was mentioned earlier: and cauterize over the Epar (liver) of his and another one over his Spleen, and also over his clavicle: and leave the open cautery for some time: then take care of him until he is well.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing althelul after excision.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you excise althelul, then heat the cautery that resembles a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then introduce the heated cautery into the excised althelul: and your last hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If there are many althelul, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have said.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them with that which benefits them from ointments until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on the bladder, it is more effective for healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing anus fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 If the patient does not obey the incision and operation as we have described at its place, and is afraid of it, he may be cured with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 When an abscess occurs and breaks, pus flows out from it, and the moisture is corrupted.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Therefore, it is necessary to test (it) with a thin probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then, recognize the depth of it by using a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then, prepare a hot cautery that resembles a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then insert yourself into the fistula while burning (and note) the depth at which the nail is inserted.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeat the cautery on (it) until all corrupted bodies are burned away, either once, twice or three times, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And take care not to burn a nerve or a large vein if the fistula is there; or if the fistula passes to the body of the bladder or the body of the intestine, then take care away from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 Do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place; and remember, it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then, take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If, however, the location is sealed off and the material is removed from it, and it remains for a long time; then you will know that it has healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 If the material is not removed from it, then you will know that it penetrates or there is a rotten bone deep within it; or it is one of these things which we shall remember later in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 Chapter on cauterizing the Kidney.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or large wind, and it weakens the body because of that, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the flank over both kidneys with a cautery throughout the entire kidney with a cautery claw, whose precedent is remembered.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we cauterize it again in the same flank.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Why three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore they will be more effective in the relief.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 Section on the method of cauterizing the Bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness or softening occurs in the Bladder due to cold and moisture, until it is unable to retain urine, then it should be cauterized on the lower part of the back over the Bladder where the hair of the comb begins, and with a cautery from the right side of the back, and another from the left: and let the length of this cauterization on the side be according to the size of the knuckle of the thumb: and it should be cauterized with a lower-back cautery or with two cauteries, if necessary: and it should be done as the preceding cauterium claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 Section on the method of cauterizing the Womb.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When coldness and moistness occur in the womb, preventing conception, and the menstrua are spoiled, and their calling forth is delayed, and pain occurs at their arrival, then it is necessary that three cauteries be applied around the umbilicus, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and a cautery below on the back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be a claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 On the method of cauterizing the anus in its dislocation.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter XLI (42).
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When the moistness of the mucosa flows out to the anus, and it becomes the cause of its exit from its place; and the sign of this is that one leg is extended over another when they are brought together; and a hollow place is found in it (the anus) due to dislocation.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore, it is necessary to apply a weak cautery on the anus itself with a similar circular cautery; after you have marked the anus with encaustum (hot wax) in a circle, as they are rolled (the anus); and that the anus falls into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let the cautery be of such a shape as was described in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large oil-burning cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII (43).\] Quando accidit Sciat
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in the anus and the cause of this is coldness and moistness; and it is treated with what was said above (for other conditions); but the treatment does not help, and it worsens; then it is necessary to dissolve the weakened one with fetid pills or with artificial pills, or similar.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of cauterization is done in two ways: either with a cautery containing medicinal substances or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 Cauterium with fire, is in many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One of these (ways) is to cauterize on top of the ankle pit with three triangular cauteries in this manner.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make it a good or bad depth (for them).
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And let the space between every cautery be of the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be greased (with oil).
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle on top of the ankle pit itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 If you want to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded the cautery in the ankle dislocation, one should be: so that the circle contains the entire ankle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And burn (or char) the thickness of the skin all over.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is attached to the ankle itself and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, at the place where the patient indicates that there is pain, and with your own cautery four fingers deep into the woody part (of the affected area); and let the cautery be a knife-like cautery.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the cautery correspond to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the patient indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, then cauterize it there where he points with a needle-like cautery, three, four or more, as needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 If he indicates that the pain is turned towards the calf of the leg (thigh), then cauterize it there with a knife-like cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 In every cauterization of yours, be careful not to burn the nerve or a major artery with the cautery, and avoid causing harm or contracture through it.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 I myself have seen one and another among those who cauterized over the heel, and burned in cauterization, and the leg swelled until the tumor reached the foot, and it was perforated completely, and the whole foot was rotten: then there occurred rupture of the belly, and death followed after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And certain wise men have said about the cauterization of the anus, whose cautery this method is.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a similar instrument of iron, whose diameter is half the width of the palm: and it should be at its opening according to the size of the tip of the thumb or less: and within this instrument there should be a third instrument.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And the distance that is between each instrument should be according to the size of the knuckle on the index finger: and the instruments should be open on both sides: and their height should be like a knuckle or two knuckles: and make handles for them of iron properly fitted in the instruments.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it is heated in the fire until it glows and casts sparks: then place it on a bowl of the weakened anus lying on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Therefore, cauterize it with three rounded cauteries at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then let it rest for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Then apply poultices with butter: and leave the open wound for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then heal it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Says Albucasis, we have not used this type of cautery enough, because of the fear of its appearance: and therefore, few are found who dare to endure it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 Verumtamen is good for the one who endures [the operation], and it finds its place with him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 Cauterium however, with stimulating medicines, is to be made so that you make two knots having a perforated armillary, from which descends the cord of its gate from brass or iron, long as the thickness of the wall: whose height in their nodes should be two, or themselves like.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let there be space between the two which is the thickness of a finger, and it should be open below and above: and let it be able to contain each other according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place it on a box of ankles, with the weak one lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand much upon the box of ankles.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour water between the two circles which is heated slightly with fire and hold it for an hour's time: and let the weak one endure its bite and his burn, for he himself finds a bite like fire until the bite ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then wipe your hand with the tool and remove warm water from the whole ankle with sweet water: then let it go for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And place butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed: and let it go for some days, and pus will flow out from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 Indeed, it is the last remedy.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain extends to the hip or leg: make a splint for him in what contains water, according to what you did in the ankle equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 This is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take alkali and half a part of unslaked lime from both of them: grind each of them, and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that enters it itself radius: and put another earthenware pot below the bottom of the pot: and pour alkali and lime from sweet water on both of them, so that each is submerged by a finger: after this you press them with your good compression: and let go the pot until the acid water comes out from the bottom of the earthenware pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then collect all that water and pour it over another pot, and let it boil until it returns.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 For indeed, it will then be very strong for sharpness, which is given in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of other members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Because it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medications are those with which they are cauterized, such as tesisie, and honey of cardamom, and chalk with soap, so that both are mixed together. (Here starts a new paragraph)
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galen himself, in telling, reported a cure for a man of old, who was cured from pain in the anus and the sciatic vein: and he praised it very much.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that it does not need other cure, and because it was cured by one application, until it returned to tell that perhaps he himself had entered the bath, and left already healthy from it.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is to be taken from the wild green sedge: and if not found, dry one should be taken, fresh: and it should be crushed a lot with some fat, and placed on the anus where there is pain, or leg, or hip: and tied, and left for three hours, or until it feels weakened by the sensation of burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then insert it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When his body becomes warm, insert it into the bed.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For pain retreats and heals.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that someone should not use a cautery with these medications unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides, who said that the feces of goats, when it is used for cauterizing the sciatic vein, gives it: and it becomes a cautery according to this method.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it on a deep place that is between the toe of the foot and the heel, and near the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry feces of goats and burn it until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Place it on wool and let it extinguish.
Deinde itera illud.	 Then repeat this process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Do not stop doing that until the sensation reaches the bone and the pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cauterization is called a "Vaccine Cautery".
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 [Title] On the cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Occasionally there is pain in the back due to various causes, either from falling, striking, excessive evacuation, and similar things, or from the infusion of cold and moist matter: and cauterization does not occur except in this sole case, which is made by the infusion of cold and moist matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after evacuation of the sick person with fetid pills and similar things on the back where there is pain, three lines should be drawn according to the width of the almeida itself, after marking with encaustic in each line five cauteries or more according to the amount that comes from the strength of the sick person: and the cauterization should be made with a cautery point.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, along with the medial claw cautery, according to this shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in the development of humpback.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This disease often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 The sign of the onset of this condition in children is that it happens above them when they are constricted during a sigh and motion: and you find at the end of the vertebrae of the back and its knots, which have already begun to emerge above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 When you see this and wish to do it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery of the following shape.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And the cautery should cover all parts of the vertebrae equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebrae with a pointed cautery, make two lines or three; and let the points be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then take care of the place until it heals as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And be careful not to administer the cautery in the humpback that occurs in a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 On the method of cauterizing in gout, and pains in joints.
Caput XLVI.	 De modis cauteriandi in morbis podagricis, et
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When pains in joints are caused by cold humors that flow into any part of the body, and when they occur in the feet, it is the custom among physicians to call it gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 Since gout caused by cold humors does not respond to the usual treatments and the pains persist, then use cautery to remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is done by cauterizing it after evacuation around the joint of the foot, with many firebrands, and let the cautery be Oliuare.
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if it is necessary to prick the sole of the foot, then do so with a hot iron (cautery).
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints and this often happens, then cauterize it over all the knee three or four times with a single firebrand, called Clavili.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If more than one cautery is required, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 Do not immerse your hand in the cautery, but rather let it be about the thickness of the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If the pains ascend to the knees and the back (of the leg), then administer what has been said in the appropriate chapter regarding cautery.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If the pains are only in the hands, then prick around the knuckles, as two lines are rolled (or twisted).
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If the pains remain in the fingers, then prick them all over, on every knuckle and on the back of the hand (palm).
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not evacuate a weak person from good diet and medicine reception.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 If good care is taken and phlegm is drained, it will be healed with God's help by this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 On the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter LIV.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When there is a rupture in the groin and the intestine or spermatic cord descends to the testicle, which is just beginning: then it is necessary that you order the patient to abstain from food on their own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And they should use laxatives, so that the feces leave their bowels.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then he should sit on your hands over his back; and order him to hold his breath until the spermatic cord appears or the intestine emerges.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then you should reduce him with your fingers and mark the place of the rupture with hot iron, with a sign whose end is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then apply the heated iron cautery, in this shape: until white matter appears and it discharges pus.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then reduce the intestine or spermatic cord to its hollow.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then place an assistant's hand on the location so that the intestine does not escape; and you have already opened between the legs of the patient, placed a pulley under him, and another servant on his thighs and another on his chest holding his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the cautery over the mark, with your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold him until you follow the bone with it; or hold it again in turn if you have not followed it to the bone in the first instance.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And be careful to observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization hour, lest you burn it and it passes over the patient causing death or great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not follow the bone with the cautery, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be fine, according to their measurement.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then, care with the remaining ointments, until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 And let the sick one lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 And it is necessary that you place his sustenance in length of the time of treatment for him, so that it will calm his stomach; lest the intestines come out during an attempt at healing and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then, when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a well-made bandage and let him hold it for forty more days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And let him be less in labor, in filling of food and drink, and violent voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 For when this regimen is used, thus it heals with a complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I will say the cure for ruptures with an incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 When ruptures happen in the rest of the belly, and they are beginning, and there is a wish not to add them, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let it be what is heated from then on as one-third of its size.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then care for him as I have said; do not add to it.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And some of the first ones have said: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is signed with pitch and a line is placed that is across its width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And put your hand in the middle with the curved cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for pains due to loss or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When pain occurs in some members due to accident or blow, and the pain persists for a long time without healing with medications, then it is necessary to cauterize it with the cautery of Point.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And let the cautery be for all members according to its size and smallness, weakness and strength, and its location and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If it is cured by the first cauterization, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then repeat the cauterization on it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because it is a custom of these pains that they are transferred from one member to the neighboring one.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore, follow them with the cautery until the sick part is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 Chapter on the way of cauterization for Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Lepers are sometimes helped by a great benefit from cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And especially the kind of leprosy that occurs due to corruption of phlegm and black bile; when you intend to cauterize it, consider this.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If leprosy is beginning and you have treated it as we said in the division, but it does not decrease or stop; and if you fear that corruption will spread over its entire complexion, then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head at a known spot, and the second lower facing the forehead towards the end of the hair, and two above the horns, and one behind the occiput on the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And place your hand with the cautery a little bit more until it makes an impression smaller than the mouth cavity and the scalp separates from it; so that expiration of thick vapors from it is relieved, and cauterize also over the spleen as it preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 If the leprosy has already spread over the sick person and it is manifestly apparent, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries which we have mentioned earlier, and a cautery upon the extremity of the nose, and two cauteries upon the cheeks, and two cauteries upon the spine of the neck, and six upon the spines of the back, and one large one over the alhahosos near the base of the tail and one upon it, in the almeidati: and two over the ankles: namely, one over the entire anklebone, and two over the knees: one over every knee, and two over the shoulders, and two over the elbows, and two over the tendons of the chest, and cauterize it upon all the joints, from the joints of his fingers on his hands to those of his feet: and cauterize upon all the heels of his feet, and upon the soles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 Cauterize the nerves which are above the heel bone (calcaneus), so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes a cautery is applied to the back of the head, another to the stomach, and another to the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 And know that the sick person does not feel pain from the cautery, as healthy people do; therefore, because his body has already become numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 And it is necessary that the cauteries be of various sizes and shapes according to the limbs and joints; this will depend on the type of instrument used.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the cautery with flour made from herbs mixed with honey, and the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in Stupor (numbness).
Caput L.	 Book L:
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a limb becomes numb and is treated with medicines, oils, plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb with cauteries, according to the size or shape of the member.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 Your cautery should go slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 Sometimes, when cauterizing in the region of the hand and foot, especially in the spine at the nerve exit points that move that limb; remove the stupor (numbness).
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But do not presume to act on it unless one is wise in the study of body parts and nerve exits.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in Albaraz.
Caput LI.	 Chapter L (Roman numerals for 50).
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When Albaraz is ancient and does not receive anything from the skills of medicine; then cauterize on top of it, slightly deepening with a cautery according to the thickness of the skin, until the white disappears and the color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with barley flour and lentils mixed with rose oil, arnoglossus leaves, and the blood of a dove and a frog; each equal part; mix all these together, soak them on a cloth, and apply them to the location until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in Cancer (Tumor).
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII (Roman numerals for 52).
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When Cancer is starting and you wish to stop it; then cauterize it with a ring-shaped cautery around it, as it rotates.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 But the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 I do not think that is correct; I fear it may burn, and I have seen it happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 And it would be better to cauterize around it with a ring, as we have said; or with multiple cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in Adubelati (boil).
Caput LIII.	 Head LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 If someone has a boil and it is slow to mature or due to excess causing it, or because of old age and weak blood or due to time and a desire to hasten the maturation of the boil, then cauterize its circumference with small cauteries, many times.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then release it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For it will hasten with the maturation itself.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If you wish to perform a perforation of it with a cautery, then cauterize it with fire, whose shape is this:
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 Place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be weakened from what follows, so that the course of the purgatives may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing a corroding disease.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 A corrosive is not anything other than a corruption walking in a member and consuming it, just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If you see a corrosive in a place that can bear cautery with fire, then use much cautery, small and large nails, according to what suits the place where the corrosion is located.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it from every side until you root out the entire corruption, and there remains nothing of it deep within.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then let it be for three days, and put sulfur pulverized with oil on the cauterized places, until all the scabs and all corruption are rooted out.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then care for it with ointments that produce flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If you see that after three days, flesh is born with a healthy growth in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery on what remains from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 A corrosive is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 The place of the cautery rises itself.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 Nevertheless, cautery with fire is more expedient; and I have already said that the cauterization of it with a sharp medicine should be used in division; therefore, take it when you need it there.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing nails and warts.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 This disease often occurs in the lower parts of the feet, and it is a thick, filtered one that injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 And the cautery is indeed in two modes: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 The quantity of the cautery with fire is such that it is similar to the concave tip of a vulture's feather: made from iron, its entirety should contain a nail; and its edges should be subtle.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the heated (cautery) on the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then, turn the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail; and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then, apply balm made of forest malve oil crushed with salt on it; and leave the balm over it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 It will be uprooted from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the place with a salve for healing flesh until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they have not been converted and frequently occur on the surface of the body, particularly in hands and feet; then administer cauterization with hot water: it is to be noted that you should take a cannula made of copper, iron or vulture feather; and place it on the nail, or althea root.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then throw a small amount of hot water into the cannula: hold your hand and turn it with slight pressure, so that the edge of the cannula presses on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail; let the weak one wait for about an hour under the pressure of hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then release it, as the nail will be uprooted with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Do this to each one, until you have come upon all that are within the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then take care of them after they have been uprooted, with the salve that generates flesh.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 Method for Cauterizing in a Shaking Motion.
Caput LVI.	 De modo cauterizandi per rotundum in Trem
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When there occurs trembling due to cold in the nerve or from quartan fever or something else: then you should cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the dorsal spine, and a cautery between every spine, and on its chest, and above its stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 For trembling ceases with the cauterizing of oil, and hastens the health from cold illness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 Method for Cauterizing Alabatrum (a type of porcelain).
Caput LVII.	 In quibusdam partibus corporis accidit, ut ne
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 Sometimes in some parts of the body, alabatrum (porcelain) discharges foul matter, that is, pustules, which are produced by corrupted substances.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, when they appear, it is first necessary to cauterize them with a fine cautery over every head of the pustule with the myrtle wood, whose tip is ignited with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of long-stemmed Aristolochia (an herb).
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are cauterized with ademenul (a type of metal), at the beginning of its expulsion according to this method; and they do not grow more; and the excess is broken, making them so, and it heals from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 But it must be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 Method for Cauterizing when bleeding from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Quando accidit sanguis fluxu de arteria, ut
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Blood often flows from an artery that is cut near a wound, which happens externally or at the incision of boils, or cautery on a member, and similar to these; and it is difficult to separate it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 When it happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery and place your index finger upon it: and tighten it much, until the blood is held under your finger so that nothing exits from there.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place in small oil lamps a few cauterizations, and blow on them until they are heated very much.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one, either small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery upon the vein, after you remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If the blood is ejected with the removal of the finger from the opening of the artery and the cautery is extinguished, then take another cautery quickly, from those which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore do not cease to do that with one after another until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And be careful, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and something evil happen to the patient through other malice.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut off [the blood]: especially because the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is extracted, the ends contract and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or it is tied with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or they are placed upon it [the wound] medications that have the property of cutting off blood, and it is tied with a tight ligature using a bandage.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 Whoever administers the amputation with a ligature and tightening with bandages, or with placing on them burning things and similar, does not completely heal him, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 If it happens to anyone that [the situation] occurs, and the physician is not present nor medicine available: then let him begin with the positioning of the index finger over the opening of the vein as we have said, and with a very tight constriction until the blood is blocked from above the wound, and on the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And let the finger not be removed, from above it with cold water of intense coldness always, until the blood freezes and thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile let him consider what he needs from a cautery or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 Chapter on Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in Wounds and Similar Matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 We have already said in Chapter One, every sickness in which it is suitable to burn with cautery and burning medicine, its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And there I placed the chapters from head to foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same path, to alleviate the person seeking what he seeks.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, my sons should remember what is in this chapter from the fear which is in Chapter One on Cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And because of that it is necessary to be more careful, since in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood frequently occurs, with which life stands at the opening of a vein or incision on an abscess or exit wound, or treatment of wounds, or extraction of arrows, or incision on stones and their similar: from all of which are associated tremor, fear, and in many of them death.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you, lest it fall upon you that wherein is hesitation, for sometimes they fall upon you in this art as do men with their weaknesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For there is one who gets angry with his illness, and death is easy for him; because of the vehemence he finds from his weakness and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when it is with fear, this signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And there is one who offers you the remedy and promises healing to you, hoping for health; but his disease is deadly.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore it is not fitting that you should agree with him who comes to you of such kind.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 Let your caution be stronger than your greed and avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume anything concerning that, unless after certain knowledge, which is proven to you by a praiseworthy sequence.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And use in the healing of all your sick, prognostication and indication concerning that to which it is fitting for safety.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For there is help to you in that concerning the acquiring of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 May God, O son, inspire you with His intelligence, and not remove from you the direction and inspiration; for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And I myself have arranged this Chapter by dividing it into sections, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from neck to feet; so that you may be relieved of that which you seek from him, and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 Chapter on the healing of water that accumulates in children's heads.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this weakness frequently occurs in boys during childbirth: or when the midwife tightens the boy's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 It also sometimes happens for reasons that are unknown.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And indeed, I have not seen this illness in anyone other than boys; and for everyone that I saw of them, death followed immediately; therefore, it seemed to me that I should abandon the operation on this matter.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And indeed, I saw a boy whose head was filled with water and who swelled up in every day until he could no longer sit upon himself because of the size of his head; and the wetness increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 This moisture, indeed, may accumulate between skin and bone; or it may accumulate beneath the cheekbone.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation on this matter, if there is moisture between skin and bone, and an abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a longitudinal split in the middle of the head, and let the width of the split be as two knuckles, until the moisture drains out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of a trephination (spatulum).
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If therefore the moisture has increased more and the abscess is larger, then place these two splits according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moisture is beneath the bone and there is a sign that you see of the head's openings widened from all sides; and water comes out when you press it with your hand towards the inside and it does not hide from you; then make three splits in the middle of the head according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then suture the splits with cloth and lint.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then anoint it above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then loosen the sutures, take care of the wound with poultices, and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 Do not let go of tying the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 Feed the sick person with dry food containing little moisture until the member is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another method of cutting is to consider where the size of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Whenever it is more in the head, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore ascend with incision where it appears to you an abscess and filling of water: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe, do not cut an artery, and may the flow of blood occur, and the sick one dies from that flow with evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 Chapter on the incision of arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When someone gets cataracts on the eyes or on the chest, and it has become chronic and medical treatment does not help: then, more effective is the final treatment in him, incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when you wish to cut them (the arteries), it is necessary that the sick person shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then scrape the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let the sick person tighten his neck with any of his cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then consider where the vein pulsates.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And the places on both sides are places that are depressed behind the ears and are rarely hidden except in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark both with hot wax: and cut each one with a spatula on both sides of the head, the incision reaching the bone; and let it be done all around the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you wish, insert a spatula under the artery and cut it towards the top with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 Let the length of the incision be as long as two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 For when the vein is cut, blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which jumps to the internal parts with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 If, however, the artery does not appear to the sense (touch), then it is necessary that measurements be taken from the ear for the space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with hot wax and cut up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And what must be released from the blood is 6 ounces (or fluid drachms), and perhaps you will release more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 All this must be done according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the sick person and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then consider for a wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 If there remains some flesh near the bone in the wound, then cut it so that no hot abscess occurs; then tie up the wound with linen rags.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with an ointment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 On the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	 Third Head.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When an old hemicrania or sharp catarrh occurs in a man due to acrimonious humidities and warmth in the temples, or an old soda, violent, and similar things: and it is treated with modes of curative medicine, but that does not help; then we have experienced extractions of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have said.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 And the method of operation in their extraction is that a weak person removes hairs which are in the temples, and intends towards the visible artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 Indeed, it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few men, or by violence of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it is hidden to you, then a weak person should tighten his head with any cloth of his, and then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or apply warmth to the place with hot water, until it appears to you in a manifest appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take the probe that I made earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then scrape the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then thrust into it a hook and draw it out upward until you draw it out of the skin, and make it emerge from all sides from the layers beneath it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If, however, the artery is fine: then envelop it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut off from it a portion according to the length which its ends will extend and contract, so that there is no bleeding.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not cut and not separated, the blood does not rise deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then empty out six ounces of blood, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large: then it should be tied in two places with a double thread, strong, of silk; or with threads of alum, so that decay does not occur to it before the wound heals and there is bleeding.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut the redundancy which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do that at that hour or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a sharp-pointed cautery; until its ends are cut through and it remains in place for the same work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 It is a better operation, unless if he is weak and has fever, or is of cold constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because the cautery is made from those things that help to stop moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the extraction of arteries, the place should be filled with boiled old linen; and small, well-made fleas should be placed upon it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after the dissolution, it shall be treated with dry medications that cause flesh to grow and with linen, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If there happens to be bleeding from an artery while you are working, then go quickly to cut it with a cautery or fill the place with wax; and press your hand until the bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If none of those is present to you, then place your finger on the place until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 Anoint the place with water of intense cold, until the pain subsides and it is squeezed as required.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And from that which is easier and simpler to extract an artery, it is to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two sharp points; and let the sharpness of the two points be similar to a needle.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 However they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Because if they are as sharp as two knives, coldness is required for both; and they do not cut the flesh swiftly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Since therefore there is some thickness in them, heat of fire is required within them; and the flesh is cut swiftly with this operation, which is better than any operation, and easier, and simpler.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between the two knives be of the size of a finger's thickness, after you mark two places with wax: and place both very hot ones, until they reach the bone, and cut through veins in two places: so that what is between its extremities may come out.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 They are not fully consolidated with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 Chapter on the treatment of acute and frequent tear ducts from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When tears are frequent and there is a channel for them from the veins on the exterior of the skull: and no remedy for them with medicines confers anything in this condition, and you see the face of the sick person becoming red, and feels walking in the forehead, as ants walk: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that the hair of their eyelashes has already been corroded by corrosion: and his eyelids have become hot from the acuteness of tears: then ancients resorted to this treatment for them, and called it a cure, with a sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And it is that you command the sick person to shave the hair on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then cut three fissures in the forehead that are equal in length to the forehead: and let the length of the fissure be like two fingers, and let one fissure be in the middle of the forehead equal to the length of the nose, and the second near the movement of the arms, and the third on the other side: and be careful not to cut the arteries that are in the sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the entire incision space be the size of three connected fingers: and have a piece of prepared sponge or dried cloth with which you can squeeze blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert a bistoury with two sharp ends, whose shape follows next.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the first incision, which is from the temporal part, to the second incision: and scrape off the skin that is between the two incisions, with a curette (sifac), which is on the bone of the forehead.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then make it also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove this bistoury and insert another tool called a sharp knife (cultellare), blunt on one side, not sharp on the other side, into the first incision.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place the sharp side towards the attached flesh with skin, and the blunt side towards the bone; push it in until it reaches the middle split, and cut off all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes; except for the incision which extends as far as the visible part of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then make it to the other split.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And when an equal amount of blood flows out, squeeze the areas from the clots of congealed blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place linen from an old cloth into each split and put over them small pieces soaked in wine, oil or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And observe that no hot abscess occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 And on the third day loosen the suture and administer a large amount of decoction with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of it with a basilico ointment and the rest that are used to heal wounds until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 Chapter on treating sharp tears and catarrhs of the eyes, from the inside of the head.
Caput V.	 Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When someone gets sharp, intense, continuous catarrhs; you see their eyes are sunken, small, and their appearance is already weakened; and the eyelids are ulcerated, hairs fall out, and there is intense pain deep in the head, aggravating and causing sneezing; then take from among these symptoms what does not come from mucus or catarrhs unless they come from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 A better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it should be ordered to shave the sick one's forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead or slightly to one side, and begin the cut from the left temple to the right temple, and let the cut go as far as the bone; and move your hand away from the temples that move during chewing, until when the bone is exposed; then dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate the gap between the two lips of the wound using warm old cloth or linen irons.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then press down with pledgets and soak the pledgets with wine and oil to avoid a hot abscess.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you release it and see that the abscess is starting to subside, then you should cut the bone until flesh begins to grow there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then treat the wound with a drying regimen to promote growth of flesh; as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, prepare an ointment from them and apply it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 [Section title: Treatment of Ear Wounds]
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something resembling a stone such as iron and wood; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is liquid, such as water, vinegar, and similar things; or it is an animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When a stone falls into the ear or anything resembling a stone that does not grow within the ear, expose only the ear: if you see a stone, then pour something from violated oil or sisamo into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer the extraction of it, and make him sneeze with a snuff, and close the nostrils at the onset of sneezing, after you place around the ear fragments from cloths or wool, and stretch the ear towards the upper part.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 This treatment is repeated many times.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not come out, then administer the extraction with Geista, that is, subtly cooked Pizigarolis [a type of medicine]: its shape is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 Therefore, if it comes out with Geista, this is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 If not, then administer the extraction with a fine blind hook, only a few times.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If it does not come out through that [the blind hook], then make a tube from brass, and insert the end of the tube into the ear opening many times, and close what is around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that there is no way for air to pass except through the tube: then draw it out with your strong pull.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 This treatment is repeated many times.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If it does not come out in this way: then take some helkalimbat or vinegar, that is, gluten prepared for catching birds, a small amount of it: and place it at the end of the radius after you have placed it accurately over it: then insert it into the ear opening with ease, after you have removed the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If it does not exit as we have described, then hurry to cut, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 The method of incision is to use a lancet on the weakened first in the head region: and draw out from the blood according to its virtue's measure.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the patient sit with his hands on his lap, and turn his ear upward, and make a small incision at the base of the ear in its fatty part at its depressed place: and let the incision be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone: then remove it along with it, which is possible for you using your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then make the incision from your side quickly and carefully, until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If what falls into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 But if it does not obey you to exit, then take a fine, thin forceps according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer with it the removal of that species from the grains which fall into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain is already moistened by the ear's moisture, until you put many fragments on it: then remove it with tweezers, or with a fine hook, or with suction, as we have said, since its removal will be eased.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 In water that enters the ear, it is necessary for the patient to sneeze with his nose pinched in first: and already fill his ear with some cooked old solution: and there lies on it the ear where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If it exits through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if it does not: then take many small, soft, warm stones according to the length of a finger, and heat them slightly with fire, and make the patient insert one from them into his ear's opening: and sprinkle some salt on his foot from that part, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Therefore, it should not cease to be done with a stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And now water comes out in such a way that you take one from parchment or reed, and insert one end into the ear; and burn the other end with fire until it is burned much of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then take another reed and do the same thing many times until all the water comes out; and draw it out with a cannula as was said before in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 In the extraction of an animal entering it [the ear], if it is of small body, like a louse, and similar to what was said in the division [of animals], take care of it as I have said.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it is of large body, which appears to sense, then administer the extraction of it with forceps and with hooks; and its substance is easier for all who hold in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you care for it with what was said in the division, and in the treatment of distillations, and your care does not help; then it is necessary that you look at the ear in sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If therefore something appears from worms there [in the ear], then draw it out with forceps or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula whose shape is narrow below and wide above; and insert the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the weak one [patient] can tolerate; then draw it out with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Do this many times until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 But if they do not obey you to come out, then circle the ear with seeds of poppy wrapped in a cannula as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 What if they do not come out with what was said: then administer the distillations which the ancients have already known for the destruction of worms; and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your flow (be) from which you pour oil and medications into the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you see make it from silver or bronze, below narrow and below it has a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Therefore let the thing that is inside the concavity of the cannel be made from bronze.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take radish, and roll on its end with a decent rolling; then pour oil or juice, or whatever medicine you prefer into the cannula, and let it be in the ear; then insert the radish rod with the heated top, and press it with your hand evenly, until the oil is pushed out in the concavity of hearing, and the sick person feels it inside; and what is poured into the ear should already be slightly heated with fire; and take care that nothing which distills into it is very cold; for medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 Chapter on the treatment of an auricular impaction (obstruction or blockage in the ear).
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 When certain infants are born from their mother's wombs not pierced (perforated).
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it also happens to some people that an obstruction occurs in the ear from a wound or flesh grown there.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this obstruction sometimes occurs in the deep ear canal, which is not visible to the eye; and sometimes it happens near the outer ear canal, and it can be seen by the eye.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, the obstruction that occurs in the deep ear and is not within the reach of sight, is difficult to cure in many ways.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in the case that is visible to the eye, it is necessary to place the sick person's ear on the sun and observe it; then if you see the obstruction appear, open it with a delicate spatula, whose shape is as follows, with its end having a small notch, part of which is sharp; and the rest of the spatula should be two-edged so as not to harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If therefore an abscess arises from the flesh in the ear: then hold it with a fine hook, and cut it out with great ease, until the whole flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If therefore an abscess is deep within the ear: then take a fine and sharp probe, heat it slightly with fire: then insert it into the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you then find that the abscess is accompanied by illness and hearing loss: attempt an opening of it with ease: but be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place linen cloth of appropriate size according to the width of the opening you have made, wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are certain that the wound has healed.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take linen cloth and immerse it in distilled water, sprinkle powdered chalk over it, and use it (to clean the wound).
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see that the ear is discharging pus: then it is necessary to extract the linen cloth, and let another linen cloth be placed over it, which has been soaked in a cerotic ointment made with rose oil, until the hot pus settles: afterwards care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If there is bleeding instead: immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, and place it on the ear: use the rest of the treatment that stops the described bleeding in the section about distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 Chapter on the care of Althaea's (marsh-mallow) for the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter 8:
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 These are the Althelil [affections] that occur in the eyelids of the eyes, which are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore, one should hold them with tweezers or with a hook and cut them at their roots with a spatula.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place it on the location of the bite, crushed.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lenticular cautionery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 For often they recur when something remains at their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 Section on the care of the eyelids of the eyes (Grandin).
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Often something happens in the eyelids that resembles a Grandio (Grandio) in its strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called Grandio; and it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower one.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore, the operation is to see if there is a Grandio proceeding from it that appears on the eyelid and moves to all parts, and its substance is easy to remove.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Then make an incision over it along its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then scrape it off from all sides with ease until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hang it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 If its removal is not prepared for you unless after you make an incision into the eyelid a little, then it harms the weak one (patient).\]
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the incision is large: then gather it together with stitches; and take care of it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, there will be no harm from that.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 Ointment restores it and fills it up.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 And if a foreign body is turned towards the inner parts of the ear facing the internal surface, then turn the eyelid inversely, and hang the foreign body with a hook; besides this, you will need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 If the eyelid is stretched out by an incision, it does not harm it in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then clean the eye after the incision of the foreign body with salt water; and take care of the place with it until the weak spot heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 Chapter on the Care of Axirnath (Eyelids)
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 The Axirnath is a growth that is generated in the upper eyelid tunic; it mostly occurs in children, and it weighs down their eyes, causing cataracts in the mornings, and they are unable to look at the light of the sun, because tears flow towards them, and on account of this, you can see them lying on their faces constantly, and sleeping on them, and their eyelids are always under the eyebrows, which have already swollen; and indeed, the appearance of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 The method of operation for it is that the weak person should put his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a clean cloth and prepare linen within it, and make a circle out of the linen according to the size that contains the Axirnath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then place it on top of it, and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in the center of that moisture with a small spatula, and let the fissure not be larger than the one made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 You must find the entire skin until you reach Axirnath, for in many arrangements Axirnath proceeds from the fracture according to the shape of a white plum's pit.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 Draw it out with a cloth that you have dipped between your fingers to the outside: and you roll your hand left and right until it is dispersed: and take care not to add to the fracture, so as not to reach the spatumelas with a lancet at the eye, and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 If, however, Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fracture, you shall gently add into the fracture until Axirnath appears.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then draw it out as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the site, and bind it with small stones.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And there are men who grind salt, and place it in the hollow of the fracture, so that it dissolves what remains of that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If, however, a hot abscess occurs at the place, then take care of it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 Chapter on the methods of Ataxmir for the eye: when the eyelid becomes soft and weeps excessively as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond the natural course of the hair, and they turn white: then they harm the eye, and cause various ailments such as constant tearing, softening of the eyelid, and clouding of the cornea until it causes the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And Ataxmir for the eye is cured according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 With sharp medicine, as stated in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 The blind man Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 With reeds, as I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 You should place the head of the sick man in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If it (the eyelid) is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if not: insert the needle into it (the eyelid), where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread, and let that be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and draw the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it up with a spatula.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a probe inserted from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then extract the thread, and place a small round piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid: then mark (tattoo) the eyelid with a branding iron in the shape of a myrtle leaf (as a mark).
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, it must be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: since this is diversified among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 For there are those who require that it (the eyelid) be cut in proportion to its size, according to the part which is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then with the probe find above the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let there be one incision near the natural hairs, as thick as a nail.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the skin (incision).
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then scrape it (the eyelid) entirely.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then sew together with fine wool and needle the two edges (of the incision), and remove the blood, and let that which overflows from the threads on the eyebrows adhere to it, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not worry about it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then release the suture and the threads for three or four days; afterwards take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish, release the wound without suture, and care for it as it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid should be raised during sealing of the wound and its collection, but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of healing was taught by the ancient ones named Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, there is concern for the sick one in it, and it comes from a good operation, but there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another method exists in Ataxmir: and it is to mark signs on the eyelid in a form similar to that of the leaf of the myrtle tree, as we have told before.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then raise the eyelid with three separated or grouped combs, according to the following shape, then cut off what is excessive with small scissors, according to this shape, with equal incisions.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If it is not possible for you to hold the comb, and it does not match it: then take a needle with a thread, and insert it into the middle of the shape; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and another thread near the smaller tear duct; and tie threads between your fingers with equal tension.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then raise your hand equally with the same lever: and lift the skin where the spot is marked, as we have told before.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then join two lips of the wound with a suture: and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If an abscess occurs at your incision or your tear, but it: pack the abscess with wax and similar substances from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes it happens that the eyelashes also turn inwards.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, you should use what I have said for this incision, but suture is more artificial for both of them.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 "On the treatment of Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 "It is as if you turn the eyelid and make an incision in the inner fissure, as I have told.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 "Then make two canines or two fine sticks whose length is the same as that of the eyelid and whose width is smaller than the width of a thumb, and you have already made an incision at the ends of both sides where you hold threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 "Then apply both together with delicacy to the excess part of the eyelid of the eye and press the two canines from both sides tightly, and release it for some days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 "For the tightened skin will die, become blackened, and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 "If it does not happen quickly, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 "Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 "When it has become solid, lift the eyelid and do not pluck hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 "And this is the form of two canines which you should make according to this shape and size in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 "On the pulling out of hairs sticking in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 "Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 "The operation is to take a fine needle, insert a thread from silk into it gently,
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 "Then connect the ends and tie them with a very fine knot; let the length of the threads be one palm."\]
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 "Then make another thin thread called Alinxotati, place it under the first and tie the ends if you wish."\]
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 "Then the patient should place his head on your lap and position it near the sun so that the operation may be seen clearly; because this operation is delicate or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 "Then insert the needle with Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull out the natural hair from above."\]
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then draw the needle above the ankle-bone: and insert the needle into the ankle-bone; if it is one, or two, or three, not more than that.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then draw your hand with it until the needle emerges with the ankle-bone at the eyelid together with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If the ankle-bone is drawn and the needle does not emerge with it: draw the ankle-bone downward, with the thread you have made in it, until the ankle-bone comes out through the superior opening, and you see it with the eye: then draw the ankle-bone and the thread; take both out, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two or three days until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is short, then join a long hair from the natural hairs and elevate it with it; or leave it as it is until it lengthens, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 Chapter on the care of the xiphacteral ulcer that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Title XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this xiphacteral ulcer happens to the eye, it is called a leporina (rabbit-like sore).
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this xiphacteral ulcer is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 An accidental xiphacteral ulcer arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 And the method of treatment is to make an incision in it (the ulcer), and to separate its lips, and to place a linen cloth between them and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 And it is not necessary to use things that dry and constrict (the ulcer) for its treatment; if you do so, the xiphacteral ulcer worsens rather than improves; instead, use softening things such as fenugreek; and embrocation with water in which althea has been cooked, linseed; and an unguent of dyaquilon that has been softened with some oil; and wrap it with a linen cloth, and treat it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 Thy treasure of care is to strive with all thy skill, that it may not become consolidated, according to the form which it originally had.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 This operation indeed, is but a correction of Alzharate, so that the form of the place returns not at all to what it was originally.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 § On the care of Alzharate that is made on the lower eyelid, and it is a swelling or contraction upward towards right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIIII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This which is below, is what is truly called Alzharate.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the accidental one is made from a wound, or a fissure, or a cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 And the method of operation in it is to take a needle with a double thread, and moisten it in flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then extend the flesh upward with the needle, and cut it with a broad scalpel.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If therefore the form of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take radium and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it; and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let their ends be from the angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle; until when joined together, this figure is formed, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that flesh by the amount of its sharp edge below, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then join the separated parts; or join it with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with what I said, with softening medications, and linens, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 If an alxatrati occurs from a fissure, whether by suturing or cauterizing, then it is necessary to examine the fissure flat under the eyelashes, as was done before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate the two lips with a linen cloth, as I have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 In summary, the treatment of alxatrari, whether it is above or below, is to perform the operation as described for preparing the alxatrari.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 For it is of many different forms: and the skilful craftsman prepares the intellect with whatever method is possible for him, until he restores the figure to its natural form or almost so, and himself who is sick, according to what suits him from the operation and the tools in various dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 Chapter on the adherence of the eyelid with the conjunctiva or the cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you insert the end of the radius beneath the eyelid and peel it upwards: or stretch it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a delicate spatula, which should not be sharp like a spatula's edge, but rather blunt somewhat: so as not to disturb the sick man during the operation, and remove the spatula, and harm the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you are scraping off the adhesion gently, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, the adhesion heals completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then pour saltwater into the eye and clean it with water: or distill it onto him from sulphur boiled with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen cloth: and place warm wool soaked in egg white over the eye: and use sulphur on the third day and with ointments until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 Chapter on the incision of the nail and protrusion of skin at the corner of the eye.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the nail is in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Or it is nerve-like and is similar to horn, subtle.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or it is not nerve-like, similar to the consistency of frozen white matter that when touched with iron or attempted to be picked up with a hook, it breaks off and the hook does not adhere to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And both types do not start unless from the larger tear duct, up to where it gradually reaches the eye, until it covers the vision, and prevents light, and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation for its incision is: let the sick person place his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Gather a small nail with a pair of tongs and extend it upward.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take the awl, and insert a horse or cow hair into it; let it be threaded, slightly enlarge the tip of the awl, fix it in the middle of the nail, and pierce it with the awl, tie it with thread around the nail, and extend it upward. Scrape the side of the nail following the pupil as if you were pulling it out to the very end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the remaining part in the root of the lacrimal with a thin spatula, or with small forceps: and let the natural flesh of the lacrimal pass, so that there is not a continuous flow of tears from the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes an onyx is extended with a chisel alone; or with a file, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then it is to be scraped with a soft spatula, whose shape is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And beware, lest the spatula touches the horny sheath and there occurs a breakage, and the pupil is pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, throw into the eye something crushed salt, or made from alum and vinegar, and let it remain until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 And then care for it as needed, until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the onyx is not nervous and you cannot insert a needle into it nor does the chisel fit into it, then this type of onyx is often treated with medicine and heals as I described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you wish to cut it (the onyx), then open the eye of the sick person and take a thin, soft, delicate spatula with a blunt edge, in this shape:
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And file the top of the onyx with a file (rasp) with finesse.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it is becoming rough and broken, and you press with the rasp into it, then drip from your hour into the eye a solution made from alum and vinegar, or red alum, or crushed salt: and close the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat this operation until the whole is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless there is a warm abscess in your eye: then let it be and treat the abscess until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat this operation on it with the rasp until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 Prominence of the lacrimal flesh, if it harms the eye severely, should be suspended with a hook and cut from it, not too deep, so that the flow of tears is not interrupted.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then drain into the lacrimal sac or reddish, or made from zinc, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 Chapter on the incision of Alguardenic and the flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 Sometimes in the eyes of humans, red flesh composed or placed, which covers the pupil, approaches it, or presses against the eyelids and perhaps turns the eyelids toward the outside; it resembles a rosebud on a column.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the operation for this is that the weak place his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open his eyes and collect the entire flesh with appropriate hooks; hold it with a single forceps or pinchers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then cut the flesh first, until the entire piece is finished with the knife.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 Be careful not to hurt the eye during the operation; let your cut be as we described in the incision of the nail or with small forceps, such as are used for cauterizing an abscess, according to the shape that will come after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 When your incision is complete and the entire Alguardenic is removed, fill the eye with ground salt or pour in red powder and similar substances from corrosive medicines; place on the outside of the eye a piece of cotton with egg white to protect it from hot infection.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If some Alguardenic remains and hot blood dominates, and you fear a hot abscess, then let the eye be; treat the abscess with what calms it.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat over him with the operation until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And similarly do with the added flesh that happens in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 Nevertheless, it is necessary that all the weak eye from a natural or accidental cause be cured without iron operation: and you shall not introduce your hand into any of these operations, until you see that this member can bear this operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 § On the collection of Sebale from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 Sebale are the red veins that surround the eye and prevent the use of its operation; and they weaken the eye for days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which there is Sebale, is strong, and there is no other sickness except Sebale; then collect Sebale of it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And it is to command the weak one that he place his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend those veins with a single hook or two according to your discretion; and the hook be subtle of double thread, according to this shape, or there are two hooks graded in one body, according to this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect those veins with subtle forceps and remove the blood by the hour after the hour, until you see that those veins are removed from the eye and dissolved; and beware not to wound the eye with the points of the spatula.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be strong in your operation very much: that you cut not except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you are finished, then pour into the eye either green or red; that with its own sharpness it may burn what remains of Sebale.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If however it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye; and let it rest for some days until the pain subsides; and fumigate it with warm poultice; then repeat over him according to the same manner until he is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 On reducing the aphthae to the nose.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 The physician named Arisatha treated a Fistula, which he cured with a cautery or with a medicine burning sharply, according to the story that preceded it.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 If it is not cured, then there is no skill in it; except to open a boil at its birthplace and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone appears.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 When the bone appears and you see decay or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument whose shape is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 It is called the roughness of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Make it from iron and let its head be round like a rasp, which is marked with the mark of a file or a fine aliskilfer mark; and place it on the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then turn it over with your fingers and press your hand slightly, until you know that the corruption is already scraped; and do this repeatedly.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with extremely dry medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place consolidates and flesh grows there, and the flow of pus stops; and it remains for forty days without recurrence, without abscessing and no accident occurs; then you know that it is already cured.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 If not, then there is no skill in it except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this shape.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 It is to scrape the bone with iron or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take a trepan according to this shape, the extreme part should be iron, triangular: and the wood part should be a pyramid extended until the extreme end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it on the bone itself; let it be close to the tear duct; and extend your hand slightly from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn your hand with the lancet until it penetrates the bone and feels weak: through this you will find wind to come out from it, when you hold your hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Then restore the place with medicines that are drying, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 When the flesh is born and hardens, then the material that was flowing out returns to the nose: therefore it is lighter above the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 Chapter on reducing protuberance of the Eye.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX (20).
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye protrudes entirely and there is no visual harm or diminution, then it must be weakened; afterwards, apply leeches to it; later place wind-drawing plasters on the neck without scarifying but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then put on the eye a liniment made of acacia, aloes, frankincense, and colophony.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then bind the eye above with a plaster containing many small stones.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the method of stones is: that you receive soft cloths, many, and each cloth should be folded over four; make many from them; then place one on top of another, according to the quantity that the eye needs; afterwards bind them above with a strong bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat the wind-drawing plasters without scarifying but with suction.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the wind-drawing plasters, and let the eye be bound day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If the binding becomes soft again, then it must be tightened a lot; afterwards remove the binding after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If you see the eye already returning to its original sheath, that is good; if not, then repeat the plaster, stones, binding, and wind-drawing plasters until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 On the incision of the bladder's covering.
Caput XXI.	 In hac operazione, si vis introitum facere in
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When a rupture occurs in the bladder's covering, it protrudes like a bladder stone and disfigures human shape because of that, and one wishes to cut it: then operation is performed on it as I have told before, namely, insert the point into the root of the bladder from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another point where there is a double thread from the lacrimal part and let it pass through: then release the first point according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut the location of the double thread and tie a part of the bladder around it with the point: and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then remove the point, and put warm linen on the eye of the eyeball: and let it remain until the thread comes out with the bladder.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then take care of the eye, as it comforts itself, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes the bladder is tightened from all sides with a circle made of cloth until the eye protrudes greatly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then a sharp instrument is inserted under the eyeball gently until it reaches deep into the eye and wetness spreads on the white part, and the eyeball drops down and enters immediately: then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 Treatment of Alcomnat.
Caput XXII.	 Et si aliquis homo habuerit alcomnatum
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 If a man has Alcomnat. This illness that is called Alcomnat is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, which is like descending water, and it itself is not.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 The method of operation in this case is to make the sick person sit on a prepared seat or chair.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take hold of his head with both hands from the sides and move it until you see pus coming down to your lower eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then it (the catheter) is fashioned and not allowed to descend, and the passage is cleared: and the sick one sees as he saw before: and if it does not descend lower, know that there is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 If the evacuation of pus is not prepared with what I said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a fine probe and punch through the horny layer slightly above the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal pannus, until the pus emerges.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When it (the pus) comes out, then pour hot water containing honey into the eye; or hot water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey; afterwards treat with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 Chapter on the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have already discussed the types of water and those suitable for perforation in conversation, when they appear and are explained, then take it according to its health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Therefore it is necessary to make the sick person sit with his face between your hands facing the sun; and bind the healthy eye, and tightly compress it; then close the eyelid of the affected eye with your right hand if the watery eye is the left one: or with your left hand if the affected eye is the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take your right thumb, if the affected eye is the left one; or your left thumb, if the affected eye is the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the end of your thumb near the edge of the cornea, on the side of the smaller lacrimal gland visible in the white part of the eye; then push with force; and you revolve your hand with it, until it penetrates into the white part of the eye; and you feel that the thumb has reached an empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And it is necessary that the measurement of the journey (of the needle) be large enough to reach deeply, the measurement of space from the pupil up until the end of the blackness: and it is the circle of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 You will see it (the light spot) within the very pupil of the eye, on account of the clarity of the corneal tissue.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place (the finger) deep until the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it down once after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If therefore water descends immediately, then the sick man sees that which opens his sight immediately, and it (the light spot) is within his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If water descends, then place it down again, except that the light spot goes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it is pressed and does not rise: then pull the light spot out with ease: and you rotate your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve something from clear salt in water, and clean the eye inside with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place outside the whole wad of wool or flax soaked in rose oil and white egg: and bind with it the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 We, and those who are of our time, place over him (the injured party) powdered camphor with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the light spot does not obey you to enter into the eye because of its hardness, since it is a person whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you receive spathule called Alberid, whose form is as follows:
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Grind it (the Alberid) with it (the spathule) only the eyelid: and do not go deep into the hole with your hand: and it is only to make a path for the light spot to reach the deep place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then insert the light spot as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 And for the completion of your work, prepare a suitable bedchamber for the sick, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark house; and let him be prohibited from all movements, and from coughing; and place food for him that softens his nature; and let him not move his head to either side at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And the suture should be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then dissolve that in the dark house and test his sight; make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then bring back the suture until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it is not suitable that he should do that during the hour of cure, or immediately after the incision; on the contrary, it should be left to others; for this reason because water rises quickly through a violent opening.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If, however, an abscess occurs that is hot: then it is necessary to dissolve the eye before the seventh day; and correct it with what quiets the abscess, until it is quieted; then without his sight, and place upon his face the purgative that regulates his vision for several days, while he remains in the dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then he should go out of the house gradually, and convert himself to his belongings.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that in surgery, a student is not exempted from seeing the operation often; then he dares to perform it.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And now a certain one from those who are of Alayrach has arrived, who said that in Alayrach, a large hole was made through which water was drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Therefore I have not seen anyone in your country who has done this; nor have I read it in any of the old books: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 And these are the forms of shapes from the great Magdee, to stand over him who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Make them from proper iron: and let their ends have the same subtlety of triangular shape, and let their points be sharp.
Formae magda.	 Form them like a large scoop.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 On the treatment of newborn flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 When diverse fleshes are born in the nose, among which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet: and from it is cancerous flesh, stone-like, dark in color; and from it is soft flesh, not dark in color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore, with respect to the soft flesh that is among these fleshes, neither fraudulent nor cancerous, it is necessary for you to make the sick person sit with his face opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and throw a hook into those fleshes: then pull them out towards the outside, and cut what you have seized with a subtle spatula sharp on one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If something remains from that which it is not possible to remove: then shave it with a subtle instrument with ease, until there remains nothing from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs: then oppose it as necessary: or it is from malignant abscesses, then run to cauterize it until the blood is removed, and all fleshes are taken away.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then throw vinegar, or water, or wine into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If the nose opens and moisture proceeds to the palate, then you know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If moisture does not penetrate as necessary, then you know that there is newborn flesh in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then it is necessary that you insert a thread of linen with some thickness and many knots; and place between every knot the amount of a digit, or less; and let the weak person send one extremity of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever he can do once he has made it similar to an azure; and draw out the odorous part until it reaches the nasal cavity, and exit onto his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed many boys in schools often make something similar to this Attomius; and it is easy for him who wishes.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place two ends of the thread, one end which exits over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then cut a piece of flesh with the knife containing the knots on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do that until you know that the flesh is already with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then draw out the thread; and place in the nose after bleeding linen which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment; do that for three days, or more, until the ointment has completely eaten away what remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then place at the end of the thing in the nose a tube of lead, for some days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If however it needs treatment that dries out, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 For the purge of the head, when olive oil and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it from silver or copper; it should be similar to a small lamp, open like a snail shell; and its channel similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the instrument for head purging should be full, pierced; with a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when heating oil or whatever you want from juices and flowable substances in it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 On the care of the nose.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius translates to: "Thelul often arises at the end of the nose and becomes more noticeable and grows with days until its appearance is unsightly.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 "Therefore, it is necessary to cut it at the beginning of its appearance and to remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 "Then place over it either a hot iron or a medicine that burns in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 "If the incision does not make it less noticeable, then consider if it is hard and black, with few senses; then do not touch it with iron, because it is cancerous.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 "For often I have seen that when a person cuts a common growth, great harm comes to the one who has it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 "And if the growth is soft when touched, not black, and you see that it can be cut out entirely, then evacuate the weakened one, and cut it without fear or hesitation; take care of the place with medicine to draw and bind it until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 "On the subject of suturing the nose, the lip, and the ear.
Caput XXVI.	 "Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 "Know that when discontinuity of one of these cartilages occurs, the operation is not effective in it unless in certain individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 "Therefore, when something happens to someone, you should consider if it is a recent wound with its blood; and then gather two layers of the wound with suture; then take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 "And if the discontinuity of the lips has already separated them, and each part is healthy; then it is necessary to remove all parts appearing from the skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 "Then gather the two lips with suture and bind them; sprinkle on top of the blood of a dragon and pulverized olibanum; place on top of the powders a piece of emplastrum diafinicon, and any other more consolidated emplaster; leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then dissolve it and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads separate by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of suturing is to gather the solution of continuity with needles, as we have told about suturing the abdomen; or to gather the solution with thread, as I have shown you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 Chapter on the extraction of neck lumps.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many people indeed suffer from hard, nodular-like ulcers similar to the seeds of grass within their outer or inner lips; and some are smaller, and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, it is necessary to turn the lip and make an incision over every node of it, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after the incision with powdered silver until the blood separates.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then it is rubbed with vinegar and treated at the place where there is stiffness, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 Chapter on the incision of the born flesh on the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Often a flesh grows over the gum which the ancients called 'abuless'.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 It is necessary that you hang her with a hook or hold her with forceps and cut her at the root, and let the pus run out, or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place upon it a powder of sieved wheat, or other healing powders, drying ones.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If the flesh returns after treatment, for it often returns, then cut her again in a second place and cauterize her; for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 [Chapter title:] On Tooth Extraction with Iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When they are gathered on the surfaces of Teeth from within and without, between the gums and rough cortex, and sometimes they become blackened, turn yellowish and greenish, until that corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and grind the molars and teeth where the cortex appears to you, and similar to sand: until there remains nothing of them, and similarly do with blackening, greenness, yellowish, and others until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If therefore what is in them is removed from the beginning by reason, it is good: and if not, then do repeatedly over them the shaving on another day, second, and third, until at last the effort comes to that which you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that the tooth requires razors of various forms, many figures: according to which it is prepared for your operation: because the razor with which the tooth is shaved from below is different from the razor with which it is shaved between the teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these forms of razors should be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 Chapter on the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary that you treat the Tooth from its pain with all skill, and delay in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For it is not that anything can be its substitute when it is extracted: because it is a substance that rises up: until there is no excuse for the extraction of it, then if the sick person is compelled to extract it himself, it must be firmly held and certified by you that the tooth in pain.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 Often pain deceives the sick person and thinks that there is a worm in the tooth and extracts it himself: then the pain does not subside until the sick tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 If therefore the toothache is certified by you yourself, then it is necessary that you should make an incision around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something virtuous, until the gums are loosened from all sides: then move it yourself with your fingers, or with subtle forceps first of all gently, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place large forceps in that place, and hold the head of the weak there between your knees: what you have already firmly held, so that it does not move: then pull out the tooth in a straight line, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If however the tooth is pierced or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with a cloth and tie it with the end of a fine radius so as not to break it during your constriction on it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And it is necessary that you be careful when making an incision around the gums from all sides a lot.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And keep your strength, so as not to break it and a part of it remains, and returns to the weak one from that malice which is greater than its first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And be careful not to do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and the boldness of themselves regarding its removal, apart from what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For many times they bring on great weaknesses in men, which are more difficult to break and all the roots of it remain or some of them: or to pull it out with certain jawbones: as we have often testified this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then it is to be lanced after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If there should be bleeding from the places (for it often happens), then rub something from pomegranate peel, and fill that place with it; and if not, cauterize it with fire if pomegranate peel is not available to you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The handles of the fine forceps that move the tooth should be long at the ends, short in the handle, thick, so that they do not split when pressed against the tooth; they should resemble the thickness of the handles of pincers, until when you pull with them, they do not bend or split: the end parts, and they should be made of iron or well-made steel, with pointed ends: and at their ends there should be teeth, some of which enter into certain ones and tighten with a proper constraint, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes the ends are like the shape of a bird's beak, which is called a stork's beak, and they are strong in compression.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 Chapter on extracting teeth and broken jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When part of a tooth remains after its extraction and breaks off, then you should place hot iron with butter on the site for one or two days until it softens; then insert algast (alum) or forceps whose ends resemble the beak of a bird called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 This is the shape of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 The ends should be made like a file or an alisclife (small pointed tool).
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If the tooth does not come out with these forceps, then you must cauterize the root and remove all the flesh, and insert a small tool called a palanca minora whose shape is this:
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 The extremity is short and somewhat thick: it should not be moist so as not to break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If the root comes out through it, it is good: and if not, it should be helped with other instruments whose shapes are like these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The first shape is a triangle at the end of which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The shape of the triangle is subtle or fine-tipped.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 It can also be helped with this tool having two branches, whose form is as follows.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools which have been described earlier in the ratio of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 It can also be helped with this tool resembling a large nail, of the following form: a triangular end twisted, having some thickness so as not to break; it should not be moist.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many tools for the teeth: and similarly the other tools are not counted; and the skillful artist, subtle in his art, discovers for himself the tool according to what the operation and illness themselves signify.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because from the diseases there are those for which no instrument was mentioned by the ancients, due to the diversity of their forms.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If the bone breaks from the jaw or from other bones of the face, or it rottens: then examine it at its place with that which suits it from the instruments and tongs that I have mentioned for extraction of roots, and help with gestures whose form is as follows.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 There should be something of thickness in it gradually, so that the bone is tightened or held with it, and it does not flee and go away, until the bone comes out; and restore the place with appropriate medicines for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there is a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape it from its rot, and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 Locking of projecting teeth over others.
Caput XXXII.	 In the head of the scalpel used for amputation, a
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When teeth project not according to their natural course, the form becomes ugly; and particularly when this happens in women and girls, that is, venereal.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, one must pay attention.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit or can be locked, neither sawn nor filed; then pull it out; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this tool, whose shape is as follows:
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It resembles a small beak and is made of iron with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And let your cut be such that you cut it over many days due to the hardness of the tooth and so as not to disturb another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 If it is projecting exposed for sawing; then saw it with a file made of iron, whose shape is as follows:
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 The whole (thing) is made of ivory, and its handle is small points of large needles, similar to a file with which scribes make pen points: with it, the hard part is gradually filed down over many days with ease, so as not to disturb the hard part and let it fall off: then smooth it, and in the end sand it with some scrapers.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If it is hard (and) breaks off a part, and injures the tongue: then it is necessary that the file is used on it until the roughness of that breakage is removed, and it is made smooth; and flatten it, so as not to injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 Chapter on the filing of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When there is shock and disturbance of the front teeth due to a blow or accident, and the weak person cannot hold what they eat so as not to fall out; and you have treated them with medicines made of wax, but the treatment did not work: then it is appropriate for them to be held with a gold wire, since silver becomes green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let the gold wire be of medium thickness and varying coarseness according to its size so that it can fit between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 And the shape of the filing is that you take the gold wire and insert it double between two healthy teeth; then wrap it with its two ends around the moved teeth, whether one or several, until you reach the end of the wire at a healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then do it again until you reach the part from which you began; and hold your hand with delicacy and wisdom until it is not moved completely; and let your grip, by which you hold the wire, be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not go out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut off the excess parts of the wire with pliers; and gather both of them together and turn them around each other; and hide these under a healthy tooth and a moved tooth so as not to injure the tongue; then release the grip, but leave it tight until it remains so.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it is loosened or cut open, tie them with another thread and let it remain so for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the shape of Teeth, and the pattern of the interlocking of two healthy teeth, and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And it sometimes happens that a tooth or two return to their places after loss, and they are held as we have said, and remain so: and this does not occur unless the skilled craftsman is careful and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes a tooth from the bones of a cow is adapted: and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in its position, where it strengthens and ties, as we have said: and it remains, and serves with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 Chapter on the Incision of the Ligament that occurs under the Tongue, and prevents Speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XLII.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 When this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 The operation on it is to open the sick man's mouth at its base, and raise his tongue: then cut the nerve ligament across, until the tongue is released from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 If there is something hard and knotty in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then thrust in the hook into it, and drill it across, until you cut the ligament, and the knot is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And beware that there is no gap in the deep flesh, and do not cut the artery there, and let blood flow.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then it is dressed with water and rose petals, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place a piece of linen under the tongue that the sick man holds all night: so that it does not become consolidated again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 If however there occurs a bleeding, then place on the place crushed zecha.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If blood defeats you, then cauterize the place with a lentiginous cautionery which is suitable for that; then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 Extraction of Ranula under tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Sometimes an aposteme occurs under the tongue that resembles a small Ranula, preventing it from its natural function and perhaps growing so much as to fill a bone.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the operation on it is to open the sick person's mouth facing the sun, and examine the aposteme.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If you see it of dark or black color, hard and insensitive to the sick person: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if it inclines towards whiteness with moisture, then pierce it with a hook, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 And if blood defeats you in your operating hour, then place on it crushed zecha until the blood stops flowing; then return to your operation until you extract it along with its contents.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and care for it with the rest of the treatment suitable for that until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 Extraction of two Apostemes from amygdalas.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Whenever there occur swellings at the throat, that is, glands similar to glands occurring outside [the neck], which are called the two tonsils: if, when you treat them as we said in division, they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If it is a hard abscess, of dark color and few senses, then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is red in color and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing bleeding, rather let it be until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Then either you will perforate it yourself or it will burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is white in color, round, and its root is delicate: then it should be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the operation in it is that you consider before the operation itself, if the abscess has become quiet with complete heat or if it is reduced by some reduction: then let the patient sit facing the sun, and place his head on your lap; and open his mouth, and a servant should be between his hands, and press his tongue down with an instrument, whose shape is as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be made of silver or brass, which is thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 When therefore you press his tongue with it and the abscess is shown to you, and it falls on it under your vision: then take a hook, and pierce it into the tonsil, and pull it out to the exterior as much as possible, beyond which you pull something from the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it with an instrument, whose shape is as follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It resembles forceps; however, its ends should be curved so that the opening of each one is in a straight line and the sharp part of one is opposite the other: therefore, it should be made from iron or wood soaked in oil.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose shape is as follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 Be sharp on one side, not on the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after cutting one almond, cut the other in accordance with this same shape of the incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then, after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If however there is a bleeding, let him gargle with water in which the rinds of pomegranates have been boiled; or leaves of myrtle and similar ones from elms, until the bleeding stops; then take care of him until he is cured.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes ulcers other than almonds two grow in the throat.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Cut them accordingly as I said, equally in the incision of two almonds.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 I myself have been cured of a woman with an ulcer that was born in her throat, which pulled towards the swelling, little sensation, which almost closed her throat; and the woman breathed through a narrow mouth, and already forbade her to eat, and drink water; and she had already come close to death, if it had remained one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 The ulcer had only risen so much that it expelled two branches, until they came out through two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 I approached quickly, and fixed one of its hooks.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it out, and a large piece came out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then I cut off that part, where it was grasped from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I did to it what came out from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened his mouth, and pressed his tongue; then I fixed a hook on the ulcer; then I cut off part of it, and nothing else came out except a little blood; so the throat of the woman was healed, and she began to drink water immediately, then she began to eat.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 I did not stop cutting out the tumor many times over a long period of time; and the tumor succeeded in its place that I was cutting out, until it grew too large with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 I then cauterized the tumor between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 Then it stood still concerning its increase; afterwards I walked away from it, and I did not know what God had done with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 Section on the excision of a tumor of the vulva.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When a catarrh descends to the vulva and becomes a large tumor, it is then called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, it is then called a swelling.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is cured together with what I said in the division, and it does not heal; and you see that the tumor is warm and has become subtle, then it should be cut out.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And if what is gathered around it is round and not long, and it is red, or of a dark brown, or black color, and there is no sensation; then it should be excised with a knife.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For there is fear over the weak one.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore when you see it as I said according to its size and whiteness, make the weak one sit facing the sun; then press his tongue with the instrument whose use was described before; then prick an awl into the vulva and draw it downwards; then cut out the tumor with one of the two instruments that were mentioned in the section on the excision of the two almonds.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And it should not be cut out from it, unless what is added goes beyond a natural limit without increase.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you cut out more from it, you harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after excision, use what was described in the section on the excision of the two almonds; and heal it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 If the sick person fears incision: then it is necessary to treat him with skill in cauterization without fear and dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 The method of cauterization is not otherwise than with sharp water: it is to place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take from the water which I told you in the chapter on cauterization, and fashion a not-extinguished lump of plaster, neither thick nor thin, and fill the hollow of this instrument with it, whose form is as follows:
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let its end where the medicine is placed be concave, like the concavity of a cochlea's radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 Place the instrument with the medicine on the wound itself: and let the sick person lie on his side so that saliva runs from his mouth through the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it to his throat and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you from above, apply it to the wound in portions of half an hour, until you see it already darkened and the bite of the medicine ceased.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you wish to receive the cautery and enclose it on the end of the radius, and pour the cautery with the medicine, and insert the radius with the cautery into a funnel from above, until the cautery adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do this often, until you achieve what you want in the cauterization of the vein.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then release it: for it burns and falls after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization, clean the area around the vein with cautery soaked in butter, and clean it with that which is around the vein from the medicine: and wash it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And it shall be treated externally with embrocis (fomentations), and internally with gargarisms (emetics or purges), until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 This manner of treatment is healthier than incision, and further from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes the ulcer is also treated with that which is more subtle than cautery and incision: it is treated with suffumigation (fumigation), according to this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take calamintus (Calaminth), hyssopus (hyssop), origanum (Origanum), ruta (Rue), sseah (probably a typo or miscopy, could be Sesame), camomilla (Chamomile), abrotanum (Abrotanum) and similar herbs from them: gather all of these together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, and boil them: the pot should be well-coated with clay: it should have a hole in its center, over which an instrument concave according to this manner is placed.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 It should be made of silver or brass: its end, where the grain is placed, shall be inserted into the sick man's nose until the vapor reaches the ulcer through the pipe, until the ulcer is greatly covered up.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeatedly over it many times, until it burns out.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And beware, not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess's advent (appearance).
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 For, usually, it is added to an abscess: and it shall not be done except when the abscess's heat has declined (subsided).
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 If this instrument is not present to you, then take a reed and make its end the rind (bark) of an ox's horn: so that the sick man's bone is not burned: since the ox's horn rind prevents the vapor from burning the bone: and this is good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 Chapter on the extraction of thorns, and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Head, XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often a bone or a fish spine, or something else, adheres in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore, it is necessary to extract whatever appears visible above which the vision falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in the sun, and when it is shown to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And whatever is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 Perhaps the attached object will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 The sick person may swallow a piece of poppy seed, radish root, or a morsel of dry bread; or he may receive a soft piece of dried sea sponge: and tie it with thread, then let him swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When it reaches the place where there are bones or teeth, and it is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If it does not come out as we have said: then use an instrument made of lead in this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 Let it be thicker than a radius, but smaller, and at its end let there be a hook that can easily enter the throat with convenience; and let him hold his head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And be careful not to touch the patient's epiglottis, so that he does not cough, and push with it the bone or spine, or the doctor may insert it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 However, what the sick person inserts himself is better: because of his knowledge of the place where the object is attached; and he pushes downwards, or pulls his hand with the instrument upward, all of it according to the size that is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	 Head, XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When a leech is treated with what was said in the division of cure with medicines, and it does not work, then consider in the throat of the sick person before the sun or after pressing his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If therefore your sight falls upon a leech, extract it with a small hook or carefully with fine forceps.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with them (the hook or forceps): then take a concave cannula and insert it into the sick person's throat until near the throat; then insert into the concavity of the cannula a hot iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do that often: and let the sick person abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him take a mouthwash full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and rinse his mouth with it, and swallow nothing from it; and move the water with his hand one hour after another.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 For a leech immediately falls when it feels water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If it does not come out with what we have said, then fumigate the sick person with bedbugs or with the instrument that I spoke of for the fumigation of the bladder.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do that often, because it (the leech) will fall by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot, in which are living prunes with fire; and let the pot be covered with a cover, in the middle of which there is an opening; and arrange the end of the instrument in that opening.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then throw the fumigation, and let the sick person put his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not come out, until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 For a leech immediately falls.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation often.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 Let the sick person bear thirst, and eat salty things and other things, and drink no water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Therefore it is necessary that it (the leech) comes out with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is drawn from the throat, when it falls upon it while seen.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It resembles forceps, as you see, except that it has a curvature introduced into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 And its end is similar to the beak of a bird called the stork, which has the roughness of a file; when it seizes something, it does not let go entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 Chapter on the opening of abscesses, and their section, and care in general.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 The species of abscesses are many, according to the recollection of them, that is, one and one in this book; and they are diverse in their perforation, and section from two kinds.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One of them is from the species of an abscess itself, and because it seizes from humors.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 And the second method is due to places where it happens within the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Since an abscess occurring in the head is one thing, and an abscess occurring in the anus is another; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is one thing, and an abscess occurring in joints is another; and each of these has its own judgment according to the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And of abscesses there are some which should not be perforated unless there is the ripening of pus in them, and its completion; and of these there are some which should be perforated while they are raw, and do not ripen according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 Such as abscesses which are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Because when an abscess occurs near a joint and is prolonged until it putrefies, what is around it is perhaps corrupted, the ligaments or that joint's nerves; therefore it is the cause of its closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 The cyst is at the main part of the body: since if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either him or through the main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 It is near the anus; perforate it, therefore, while it is immature: for it is not necessary to perforate a raw cyst, which has not completed digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not rot deeply and extend towards the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or remain at its end which will not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 It is necessary that you know the hour of perforating the cyst, which has matured according to its completion; and it is at the stage of sedation of pain, recession of fever, diminution of redness, pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the cyst; and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And it is necessary that you perform the same perforation at a lower position of the cyst, and of greater prominence: and the perforation should go in length of the body, if cysts are in the parts of hands and feet, and in places of arms, shoulders, necks, veins, nerves, arteries, and finally in all places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those which are reflected, go with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 But when the cyst is in fleshy places: then it is better to delay its perforation until its digestion has consolidated, as we said according to its completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 Since if you perforate it beforehand, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there are many filthinesses and dirtiness, and perhaps its edges harden, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some cysts are perforated according to the width of the body in necessity; or according to that which the member requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 It is necessary that you administer a small perforation for small boils and a large one for large boils; or multiple incisions similar to the size of the boil.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 In some boils, it is necessary to concave the skin; and to cut when it has become like a piece of cloth, and has reached a point that is already dead: as happens often with many, so that they burst, and with buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And among them are those to be cut through an incision having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And from these is one in which it is to be cut like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 Like an inguinal boil.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And among them are those in which a round incision is administered, and a crescent-shaped incision; and similar to these from incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 But that one without a head, such as are soft superficial boils, it is necessary to perforate it with a superficial perforation or only flatly.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 And it is necessary when the boil is large and has collected much pus, to perforate it so that it does not burst and you extract all the pus in that hour; rather, extract a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then press the boil until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then extract something again from the pus.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do this often according to gradation until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak in vigor, or a woman pregnant, or a small child, or an old man decrepitus; for the animal spirit is resolved many times with the discharge of pus; and perhaps the sick one dies, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Beware therefore that this chapter requires great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your perforation of the boils, which you perform, it is necessary to clean the wound; and observe.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If therefore the wound is small, or it is a plain incision, then administer linen lice or ancient cobweb.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if the wound is large and there are many perforations, then it is necessary to insert linen into each perforation until they meet.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if you cut off a piece of skin in the wound or hollowed it out, then it is necessary to fill it with ancient cobweb, or as when cloth is sewn, or shorn with flaxen linen without moisture, and tighten it for three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then throw it away, and care for it with whatever is necessary from the ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 If however there is bleeding during your operation hour, then administer cold water and vinegar, after which a cloth is soaked in them; and place it on the site of the bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 If however the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer treatment, care and powders as I have described in many places of this book of ours, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 If however it is winter time and the wound is in many nerves: then it is necessary to pour powder with wine and hot oil over them; and place them on the sites.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is summer and the sites are fleshy: then it is necessary to place powder soaked in water, or oil, or with wine and oil, and everything should be cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary to dissolve the wound, and wash it, and administer for its care whatever is suitable until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 This is therefore what is necessary universally regarding the treatment of abscesses.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the method of classification, as I have already said regarding every ulcer, here is the procedure for treating it individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 Chapter on the incision of ulcers that occur on the head skin.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter XL. (Forty-first chapter)
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 Small ulcers occur on the head skin and they are of the type of tumors enclosed by the membranes which resemble small pouches; as if they were engorged with fluid like a hen's pouch.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And their types are numerous.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Among them are the fat ones; and among them are those that contain moisture similar to clay; and among them are those that contain moisture similar to ointments and powders; and similar to these, and among them are those which are hard like stone.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in incising all of them, and extracting them, there is no fear, as long as it does not create opposition to an artery during the incision.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the operation in incising them is to explore it with an instrument whose shape comes afterwards, which is called Probe, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if it contains moisture, then cut it along the length with a superficial incision in this shape (circular).
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin with a cut along line b to line g. Therefore when the moisture is evacuated, then scrape off the scab that contains this moisture, and do not let anything remain deeply within it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For many times it returns if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill up the wound with it, and let it remain until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For it corrodes what remains from the scab.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then again on the wound with second Egyptian ointment, and third, and if necessary, until you trust that nothing remains from the scab, then take care of the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If an abscess contains a thick knot: then cut it according to this form, having the shape of a cross; and throw hooks between the angles of the cut, and scrape it from all sides; and try your strength in extracting the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 If, however, it opposes you an artery, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And the same procedure should be followed with an abscess that is stone-like, by cutting and treatment as described above.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 The cut over a stone-like abscess is easier since there is less blood and moisture involved.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 There are sometimes such abscesses on the heads of some men that have no deep moisture within them.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 This is because I have cut over an abscess on an old woman's head, and found the abscess to be like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if anyone struck it with something to throw it away, it would injure itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 In other kinds of boil-like conditions on the head, except for those boils occurring on children's heads and around the roots of ears, a section of all of them should be a superficial one.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Make a perforation of all of them always from the bottom part of them to alleviate the course of pus towards lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then treat those with whatever is suitable for them in terms of treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Chapter on the sectioning of goiters (swellings of the neck).
Caput XLII.	 Chapter XLIX.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These boils occur frequently in the neck and under armpits, and sometimes in the groin; they may also occur in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And on top of those that occur in the neck, there is one main swelling (goiter), and many smaller ones; they are generated around each other; every goiter among them is within its own layer, like knots and boils on the head as we previously mentioned.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 The types of these goiters are numerous.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 They can be hard (stony), some contain moisture, and there are also malignant ones which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 In the one among them which appears good, with a proper disposition, whose softness is close to the skin color and it moves throughout all parts and is not attached to the neck muscles, groin or arteries, nor deep; it must be cut out by superficial section from the upper part of the body to the lower part from the line b to the line g, scrape it off from every side, extend two flaps of skin with a scalpel or multiple scalpels if needed as we mentioned in boils on the head, and remove it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And be careful not to cut into a vein or a nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the lancet not be very sharp: so that it does not cut your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If you cut a vein or artery, it prohibits you from performing the operation, then place in the wound alum powder or some powders that coagulate blood, and tie the wound, and leave it, until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 For blood is coagulated by a linen cloth, therefore return to your operation when you finish.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then examine your index finger if there remains something from the Straphs (suture materials) or other small ones, therefore cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If it is at the root of the suture material a large vein, then it is necessary that you do not cut the suture material from its root: instead you should tie it with a strong double thread and leave it until it falls off without damage.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with an old cloth that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then take care of yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the suture material is cut completely, then it is necessary that you gather the edges of the wound together and sew it immediately, after you see that there is no redundancy left.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 If you see that there remains redundancy due to the size of the suture material, then it is necessary that you aim at cutting its root and pulling it out, and apply the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And those from the suture materials that contain humidity, pierce it with a superficial perforation, so that the place of maturity appears to you: and place the perforation below that which follows the lower part of the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer after perforation linseed with ointment, and similar ones, to burn what remains from corruption, until when you see the wound already clean: then care for it with regenerative flesh ointment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 On a section of the epiglottis due to ulcer within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients said this section of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is their writing.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 However, in those with synanchias (a medical condition), the section of the epiglottis should be avoided; for there is no benefit in this, because all veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 In those who have a hot ulcer in the mouth, throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the channel, it should be done with section of the epiglottis to prevent loss that happens from suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we want to do that, we should cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small section in width, at the place between two circles by amount, so it is a section in sifac (cartilage), not in cartilage; and this place is suitable for cutting because it lacks flesh, and blood vessels from it are distant.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the doctor is fearful, then it is necessary that he spreads the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then make an incision in the skin until when it reaches the channel; avoid blood vessels, if he sees something from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then cut the sifac (cartilage) as we said; and it is indicated by the mucus that comes out of it, with what breaks off, and voice loss.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 Let the open wound heal at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 When the feared putrefaction is removed, bring together two lips of the wound's skin and its flesh alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medicines that cause the flesh to grow until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 This sums up the conversation we reported, it is not a treatment unless they see that one of these abscesses has already burst and the sick person's throat has opened: and he was raised from near death and wished to cut himself because of his shortness of breath: they go to cut the Epiglottis so that the sick person may breathe over the wound site with some breath, and be saved from death: and for this reason they ordered to leave the open wound until the malice of the illness is consumed, and the malice lasts three days as if it were itself: therefore, they then ordered to cover the wound and treat it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And I myself have seen that a maidservant took a knife and sent it into her own throat, and cut a part of the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was called to treat her, and found her gasping, as the gasp of the dead does.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 So I uncovered [the wound] and found blood that had come out from the wound to be small.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 I was convinced then that she herself had not severed the vein nor the windpipe, and air was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I therefore approached her wound and treated it until she was well: nothing else happened to the maidservant except a hoarseness in her voice, and she returned after some days to a better state of health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 From this I say: there is no fear in cutting the Epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 On the operation for hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This abscess called hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is much more common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 It occurs in two ways: either it is natural or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 In the natural, certainly it is not a birth defect.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The accidental one occurs in two ways; of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the other mode is similar to an abscess that forms from a swelling of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 There is a fear in it, and it should not be presumed to cut with the iron unless in the part that is small; and you test it, and examine it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you find it similar to a fatty node and not suspended with any veins, then cut it, as knots are cut; and remove it along with what contains it from the cavity, if it is in the cavity; and if not, then examine the entire area.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the place with what is required for treatment until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 Chapter on the operation for nodes by position.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already said all their types in division; it is necessary that here I tell the difference between a Node and an Exitura: although causing doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 I therefore say that an Exitura is heat, fever and violent pains until the boiling of superfluity subsides and putrefaction is completed; then indeed the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 A Node however is neither heat nor fever, nor pains; and it contains them with the kistis sifachin, which is their own proper sac, and it is according to the color of the body; and it is a beginning of them like a chickpea, and it forms like a grape, and larger or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And they are according to two kinds: either fatty; or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 The colors of the moisture are many, according to what I have said in division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a Node, it is necessary that you test it and examine it first with the instrument called Intromissum, according to the form its chapter which comes after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 And the method of investigation of abscesses and nodes of all kinds is that you receive this instrument, and insert it into a more moist location that you find in an abscess; and you move your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then, finally, place your other hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then withdraw the Intromissum, and observe what comes out following its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If therefore moisture runs out with any color; then cut it off with a superficial section, according to what I have said in other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if moisture does not run out in the track of the Intromissum; then you know that it is fatty; cut off above it with a section shaped like a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from all sides with ease; and guard the kistis if you can over it, in order to extract the healthy one with the node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If a cyst is torn apart during the operation and it cannot be extracted whole since it often happens thus, then extract it piecemeal until something remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 If something remains of it, whether little or much, a nodule returns most often.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If it defeats you and something remains of it little: then fill the wound at its completion with some corrosive sharp powders; and tie up the wound and place upon it what sits a hot boil, and take care of it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If therefore a nodule is large, then its two folds and treat it along with whatever incarnates in it.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 If it is a pulsating vein or not pulsating facing you: then proceed and fill the place with zegi ground, and leave it bound for two or three days until the wound rots and the boiling of blood subsides; afterwards return to cut what remains from the nodule.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 Chapter on external instruments for cutting and puncturing.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 Of these there are forms of probes, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 Among them is the great one, among them is the medium-sized one, and among them is the small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Make them of square iron tips accurately, so that they may enter quickly into a boil.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these are the forms of Experts and no (puncturing), and one of them is called beris, i.e., piercing, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 From them is great, and middle, and small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They meet so that they can be incised, excised, or lanced, and drained of pus, and abscesses from the bone which is between them.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And others become round, smooth, soft, such as the large needleheads which are held in place with cement, namely, of glass or metal, iron, copper, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 Those that are made of glass are superior among them.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And experiments are also made with black lead which meet so that they can test abscesses whose hollows have reflections to soften them along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 There are again three types.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because there are long ones, medium ones, and short ones, according to the size of the abscess or narrowness of its opening.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The form of scoops, and they have many shapes.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because there are simple ones, namely those which have one curvature; and they have three types as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And among them there are blind scoops; and they also have three types.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And among them there are scoops having two curvatures; and they have three types: and among them there are scoops having three curvatures, and they also have three types; and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 These are the forms of scalpels with which knots and nodes are cut and incised; and they have three types because there is a large one, a middle one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 The tips where a cut is made are sharp, the other ends are not; they are not placed thus except as an aid during the incision of knots near the fear of cutting a vein or nerve; and so that healing can take place, and the weak person may find some relief from the heat which he finds during the incision of abscesses.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are Magda, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made from copper and are similar to a rod, like when alcohol is made: and at the end it has a wide point, hidden punctum Spatumilis: and within it flows both towards the inside and outside as you wish, just as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The shape of punctum Spatumilis hidden among the fingers for the perforation of boils: and the weak do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The shape of Ventosarum with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 Make them from copper or citron, round, slightly shorter in length as you see, and make them delicate.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 And it is necessary that these shapes of Ventosarum are with you large and small: to cut off blood quickly when needed, and then when medicine is not present with you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 Nevertheless, do not use them for the removal of blood in every part of the body, and do not use them unless in fleshy parts: such as the thighs, hips, arms, breasts, abdomen, groin, and similar to these, from fleshy moist areas.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes they are made into small instruments similar to the fists, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from a location of phlebotomy, or incision of vein, or artery: and sometimes they are round, according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 Chapter on the care of human breasts resembling the breasts of women.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter LXVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell during sleep (that is, when they begin to dirty in sleep): and remain postemous, filthy.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Whoever recoils from that, it is necessary to cut across the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Fill the wound with a ointment made of wax.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bring two lips of the wound together with stitches, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the breast, however, hangs down towards the lower part and softens due to its size, as happens with women: then it should be cut in two on either side with two crescent-shaped incisions similar in shape, one contained within the other, so that the larger line contains the smaller, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off the skin between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what I have said about stitches and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If you do not make the incision as required, because of the restlessness of the sick person, or due to bleeding: then fill the wound with a sterile linen cloth soaked in a corrosive ointment and leave it until it burns away what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 On the lancing of an abscess, which happens under a boil.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These abscesses that occur under a boil are of the types of hard strobila containing cysts, and among them are those containing liquids.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Those that contain liquids should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision according to this form from line b to line g. When all that is in the abscess has been evacuated through pus, then fill it with a sterile linen cloth and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the wound and treat it with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the boil is of the kind of Strophulus nodes, then cut it open as we said in the section on Strophulus equal cuts.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If the wound extends so that it discharges pus, then administer cautionery, as we said in what was mentioned earlier.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 Section on the Boil which occurs due to an Artery and a Vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When the artery bursts and the skin above it becomes consolidated, a boil often occurs; likewise, a boil or swelling occurs in a vein as well.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which it is known that a boil and swelling are due to an artery or vein are as follows: if the boil is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated in the deep body; and when you press the boil with your fingers, it feels as if there is a hissing sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And what is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 Cutting open such a boil is an error, especially if it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many parts of the body; and it is very dangerous.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, its care should be avoided with an iron, and it is especially necessary to avoid such treatment on the limbs or head.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 On that which is due to the expansion of an artery opening, make a cut on the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the incision with scissors, then the artery; and free it from tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert a probe under it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread in two places, as I taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then pierce the place that is between two ligaments with a lancet until blood that is within it all comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off; then take care of it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If it is an abscess due to a vein incision, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what is possible from the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert a needle under the place that you held with your hand and make it penetrate; let there be a double thread in it, until you pull it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then tie the abscess with a good ligament; as I told you before, in the ligament of the vein, from two parts with two ends, with threads.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 If you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with a new thread under the whole abscess near the incision; press and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the abscess in the middle of it until what is within comes out; then cut off the excess skin and let go of what is tied from there.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place a poultice made of wine and oil on top of the wound that you have submerged.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer treatment with linen cloths and suitable ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 Chapter: An abscess that occurs from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As it happens with an aposteme in an Artery and a Vein, similarly it happens with an aposteme in Nerves: what happens to them by striking or laboring excessively, or similar causes: and it mostly occurs in places where there are joints, or heels, and in any place where the connections move: and the aposteme is severe.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 Its color resembles the rest of the body and it is in various positions without pain: and when it is tightened with vehemence, it feels weak like dizziness in it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And the aposteme is not gathered in the deep body, instead it is under the skin, and itself moves to every part, and does not reach the front or before, nor does it go back to the rear parts.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 What is therefore at the joints, should not be invaded with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 For perhaps it will happen that a contraction occurs.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 But what is from them in the head or forehead, cut the skin with a lance.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If therefore it is a small aposteme, then hold it with forceps and drain it from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and strip it; afterwards remove it, and sew the wound with stitches: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 [Paragraph on removing an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.]
Caput LI.	 [Chapter LXI.]
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 Certain people often have abscesses in their bellies and in other parts of their body, which are called Fungalias, similar to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Whose root is subtle, and their head is coarse, and their lips are turned inside out.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And it is small from them; and there is one from them that grows very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 And indeed I have seen a man whose belly had two abscesses that were like large mushrooms to other things: there was no difference between them, white with small roots and their lips turned inside out, drained and moisture ran out of them constantly.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I made an incision, and found one to weigh about X and VIII ounces, and the other about VI ounces. The operation in making an incision of these is that you should consider if the patient is weak and pale, and the color thin, moist, and tender: then make the incision with a broad lancet, and have cauteries ready in your presence.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 For often blood is expelled during the incision: therefore be careful if the blood overpowers you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see a weak, afraid and timid person from the incision with iron, then take a well-made wire of lead, and bind it with it to the athelul: its method is as we have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add lead in the ligature.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore do not cease to tie lead, whenever it presses in a thin place, until it is separated and falls out by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 But if the thin place is large-rooted, then there is something to fear and be afraid of in making an incision of it; especially because it is in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 However, it is possible to make an incision in the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then take care of it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And be careful not to make an incision in a thin place that is of a dark color, with few senses and foul appearance; for it is a cancerous apostema; and I will come back later with the reminder of Cancer.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 Chapter on the care of hernias of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 A hernia of the umbilicus arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 Either it comes out through a fissure above the abdomen, and an althub or intestine comes out, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 From the blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been mentioned previously.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 From the obstruction of flatulence in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If it is due to a hernia in the scrotum, and a discharge: then its color is similar to that of an abscess; and it is soft, without pain; and its location appears diverse.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to an intestinal protrusion, then its location, as we have stated, is of more violent diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 Therefore when you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns and perhaps there is a sound along with it; and it becomes greatly inflamed at the entrance of the bath and causes violent pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 But if it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor can it be compressed, nor does it increase in size.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears towards blackening from the heel.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is due to a piece of flesh: then an abscess is heavy, large, hard and heals according to the size of one unit.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 But if it is due to flatulence, then when touched it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the operation in it is to examine then whether the protrusion of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or flatulence; then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I said abscesses due to an artery or vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 But if the protrusion of the navel is due to an intestine or a tumor: then you must command the sick man, so that he holds his breath and stands still, extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then mark (the place) with hot wax around the whole umbilicus.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Then command him to lie down on his back between your hands (on the back).
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then circle with a broad spatula around the place that you have marked with hot wax.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Then stretch open the wound with a large spatula (or probe) towards the top (of the body).
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind him around with a strong cord or with a silken rope that is tightly knotted (tied) firmly: and let the knot of the binding be alienated.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open up the extended wound above the binding (ligament).
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If then you find that the man is already caught by the binding (ligament): Then extract the alienated, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the inner parts of the abdomen: And if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut off its superfluidity.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 But if it is contrary to you (i.e., an artery or vein), then circle him very much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your surgery (procedure).
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert into them two strong threads: and insert the two needles into the circle that you made around the wound in the form of a cross, making them penetrate (through).
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then stitch (close) the wound in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the rotten flesh extends: and let it fall off by itself; or cut it when it becomes soft and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with what is necessary from ointments, until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 But if the protrusion of the navel is from a cancerous flesh on him, or from moisture: then it is necessary that you excavate (the wound), as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And extract blood or moisture that you find in him.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then treat him yourself, with whatever solves the problem.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 On Cancer Treatment.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have already discussed the types of Cancer and its method of treatment with medicines; it is to be cautious about treating it with iron, as it should not be cut: and we have said that Cancer originates in the matrix, and cautery should be avoided in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated; such as Cancer which is in breasts or hips and similar limbs, to remove it entirely: particularly when it is beginning small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 When it becomes old and large, one should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I was unable to heal from it anyone; nor did I see anyone else before me who reached that point.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when placed as we have said, is to precede and dissolve the weak from black choler several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then you will find the phlebotomy itself if there is a clear swelling.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the weak with a preparation where it is placed during the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then insert the hooks that fit into the Cancer.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then hollow it out from all sides with the skin, according to examination, until there is nothing left of its roots: and allow the blood to run, and do not cut it quickly, but rather press the places, and remove all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever is possible there with instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If the flow of thick blood from the cut artery or vein opposes you; then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 Chapter on the Care of Hydrophisis.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We have already discussed the types of Hydrophisis, how it accumulates water, and all its signs; and the treatment of it with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	That which is treated with iron, is nothing but the appearance of an abscess alone: and it should not be approached with iron the appearance of a tympanic membrane: nor the appearance of hypodermis deeply: for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you have already been treated for this appearance of hydropic tympanic membrane with medications, and it has not improved, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 If weakness has already come upon the sick person, or if there is another illness besides hydropic membrane, such as cough, diarrhea, and similar conditions: then beware not to treat it with iron, for it is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 If you see a sick person who has an excess of strength and there is no illness other than hydropic membrane, and he is not a child nor an old man: then there is room for treatment in him. You should lift the sick person standing between your hands, and after him a servant should press his abdomen with his hand, pushing water downward to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a sponge needle with this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with an acute tip like a sponge needle.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, there should be something of shortness in it, so that you do not pass through it completely during the operation to the intestine and harm it.
Deinde considera.	 Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 If the hydropic membrane is generated from the part of the intestines, then it must be stretched by cutting off a length of three fingers below the navel towards the lower parts above the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 But if the generation of hydropic membrane is due to liver disease: then your cut should be on the left, three fingers below the navel.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 And if the generation is due to the spleen, then the cut should be on the right side: and it is not necessary for the sick person to lie on the side over which the fluid flows, so as not to flow excessively to the weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then pierce through the entire skin with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert the spatula into this incision and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and tissue as if you are peeling it off; let the amount that is to be peeled be like a nail or approximately so.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then pierce the tissue until the spatula reaches an empty place; there is water there.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then remove it (the foreign body), and insert an instrument of this shape into the opening.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 It resembles a cannula; it is made of silver, bronze or brass, linen, cleaned; on its lower part there is a small hole, and on each side there are three holes, two from one side and one from the other; the end of it is cut in the manner of a calamus incision, as you can see; at the upper end there is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument; therefore let out from the water a quantity of an hour (approximately).
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 Because if you let out too much from it, the sick person may perhaps die due to the resolution of his vital spirit; or he may experience a syncopis approaching death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 However, let out from it according to its potency, and according to what the signs of the sick person's condition indicate to you, and according to his pulse and the quality of his condition.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 This is because it should be immediately retained due to the skin that closes the opening on the tissue, about which I have told you to pierce it in this manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then insert the instrument again on the second day if you see that the sick person can tolerate it; and let out from the water a smaller quantity as well.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Do this for several days without fear, and be cautious to avoid error; until no water remains except a small amount.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If however you fear the patient and let him depart from much water: then care for him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and wait for thirst: and care for him with dry medicines, until he is cured: and cauterize above the stomach, and spleen, after extraction of water: according to what I narrated in that which preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 On the care of infants who are born with their urinary passages not pierced.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When any infant is born from his mother's womb, and the head of the cord is not pierced, or the opening is narrowed, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, assistance must be given with piercing it immediately upon birth, using a very sharp spatula in this manner:
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a thin nail made of lead into the wound and tie it; hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When he wants to urinate, remove it, and mix (it with something).
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then return it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not place the lead, now it is possible that the urine which flows over the place does not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 But for one whose wound is narrowed, he is treated with lead, as we said, for many days until it becomes wider.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 Because from those who are born, the opening is at the end of the spine; therefore, he cannot mix toward the front until he lifts the spine with his hand to a higher place.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 It is not a generation for him because the seed cannot reach the womb according to correctness; and it is a very foul illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the method of operation in this case is that the sick person lies on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend the head of his spine with your left hand using a powerful extension and cut the head of the spine from the location of priapus, with a sharp point or chisel; similar to the incision of a reed, or like you root something, so that the middle comes out similar to the head of the spine; and let the opening fall in the center as necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And beware during your operation of blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 This often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore oppose him with what cuts the blood, and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 Section on Albathar (inflammation) that occurs in the prepuce and head of the penis, and corruption, blackening, and adhering to.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 These Albathers frequently occur in the vein, and it is an eminence of foul-smelling flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from this there is one that is malignant, and one that is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hang up the non-malignant one with a fine hook and cut it off, until you clean it all.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then place a dish submerged in Egyptian ointment on it.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then treat the wound itself with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If the Albather is malignant and of a foul color, then it is necessary to administer cautery after its incision and its excision.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 If however the Albather is on a male slave's foreskin, not circumcised, and part of the Albather is inside the foreskin and part outside: then it is necessary to remove the Albather that is inside first, until it solidifies, then treat the exterior. Because when you treat it at the same time, the foreskin will not heal unless it bursts open.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And they also occur in the testicles, and a darkening and decay of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hollow out everything that has already turned black and what is about to rot or is already rotten.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then apply linen over it after that with honey that has been beaten with flour and grated bark of walnut trees, and sieved herbs of the mill.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 If there is a flow of blood, then administer cautery with lunar cautery in this shape.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 For cautery is useful for two purposes at the same time, that is for a flow of blood, and for a wound when it is injured.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head of the vein is corroded and destroyed completely within an hour: then it is necessary to insert a cannula made of lead into the penis to mix weak urine on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 In a real attachment of the foreskin to the head of the gland, and this attachment indeed occurs only in one who has a healthy foreskin and circumcision is not required: and sometimes an attachment occurs due to a wound or an abscess: therefore it is necessary to scrape off the scab with a blunt spatula until the ligament dissolves and the head of the gland is released from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to distinguish it precisely, then it is necessary to scrape off something from the head of the gland and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 Because when the foreskin is thin, it may be perforated quickly on account of its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the foreskin from the head of the gland with a thin linen cloth that has already been made wet in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is treated with wine of cedar until it solidifies.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 On the purification of infants and their treatment due to errors that may happen to them.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a solution to continuity, like other wounds; but since it comes from our operation, and its use is specifically for boys, it is necessary to mark it with a better sign and a lighter way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books; because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have learned through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 Because I found that most craftsmen and phlebotomists use purification by cutting with a knife or forceps; they use ligation with thread, and incision with the nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And I myself have already proven all these methods, and I did not find a better purification with forceps or ligation with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Since in excision with a scalpel, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Since the prepuce has two layers of skin, it is perhaps cut through the upper layer and the lower layer is spared; therefore it is necessary to make another incision, and pain will result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And when excision is done with the awl, that is, the thumbs, which shoemakers use, the extremity of the male member is not cut through; since it may enter its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 However, when excision is done with the nail, perhaps iron slips out and ruins your operation; since a child's skin is short by nature, and it often happens that such cases do not require excision; indeed I have seen this happen myself.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 Furthermore, when excision is done with scissors and a ligature with thread, I discovered a good experiment for you; because scissors are proportionate to the incision, so the sharpness above is like the sharpness below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 Therefore when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses correspond to each other and cut according to one operation at the same time; and a compression similar in shape occurs, containing the skin of the rod on all sides with which no mistake can occur at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 And the method of your operation is that you should hold the boy, if he understands a little, so that you do not bind the thread on his rod unless you only tie it; and leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him happy and cheerful in every way possible for you, from the fact that he receives his intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand between your prepared hands and not be seated; and conceal the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand into its sheath, and blow on the skin, and draw it upwards until the head of the arrow emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then clean it thoroughly from any dirt that accumulates upon it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then bind the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Then bind it a little lower with another ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold it with your index finger, and with the thumb retain well the lower ligature, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then lift the skin up quickly, and extract the head of the arrow.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better); and put powder on top of it; and above the powder place a cloth in which a cooked lamb's lung boiled in rose water has been spread out, crushed with fresh good olive oil; and let it remain on it until the next day; and take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The shape of the forceps for cleaning is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 Let them have two ends pointed, and let them be curved; so that the branch of the nail does not come out in them; and let the length of the points be equal to the length of two handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 But an error occurring during cleaning is when the entire inner skin or part of it escapes at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, you must stretch it out with your nail from your hour before the excision of the place, and cut it equally.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a tweezers, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 If three days have passed and there remains what is inflamed under the arrow, at the site of the incision; then let it be, until the abscess settles down warm, and scrape off that area easily, and cut it according to how you prepare yourself; and take care not to touch the head of the arrow.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 That will not hurt him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Treat that with it, as it heals the wound with the powders which we have mentioned in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut deeper than the measure and goes to the inner parts, it does not hurt him even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Treat it with that until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 On the extraction of a retained bladder stone.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Retention of urine in the bladder, occurs from a blockage made by stone, frozen blood, pus, flesh born, and similar things from those which we mentioned in the mode of treatment division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if the urine does not resolve and you see that its retention is due to a stone already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that he be weakened on his knees bent.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then place his feet on his back, and he should extend his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and he should strain as much as possible for him to breathe weakly.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 Therefore, when the neck of the bladder is compelled towards expulsion of the stone, the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If it does not resolve as we said and the pain is strong over the weak one: then it is necessary to administer extraction of him with the instrument called syringe, whose form is as follows: It should be made from silver, and be thin, flexible, concave like a feather quill in delicacy, long like the palm of one hand and middle: to which there should be a thin cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the method of urine outlet through it is that you receive a double thread and tie at its end wool or cotton, good binding: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut if there is excess wool with scissors, but introduce into the cannula with force, as one pulls.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and beeswax: and make the weak one sit on a chair, and warm the bladder and his member with moist oils and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then introduce the syringe into the member with ease, until it reaches the root of the member.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then double it from above the navel part.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the syringe into it until it reaches the bladder and feels weak that it has reached an empty place: this is not done according to this order unless because the channel through which it passes is where there is a twist.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 Wool will follow the vein.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then draw it out and make the vein run through the urine way: then repeat the syringe, and do not stop doing that until the bladder is emptied, and the weak alleviation is found.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 Section on the quality of clysterization of the bladder with a syringe.
Caput LIX.	 Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When a wound occurs in the bladder or blood freezes within it or pus collects and there is a desire for distilled waters and medications to be poured into it: then let it be done with the instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It (the instrument) is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And within it there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And there shall be a concave place where that which drives it is situated, according to its capacity without addition, until when something is drawn out with it, it is attracted by humidities; and when it is pushed, whatever is expelled with it goes far away: this is how the clepshydra works, from which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is thrown in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 When there is a desire to pour waters into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepshydra into the water and draw out with it what pushes it upwards; for humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clepshydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then introduce its end into a rod, as we have described in a syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then push the water with it, for indeed the humidity reaches the bladder immediately, so that the weak one feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The form of a subtle enema to cleanse the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Let it be made from silver or brass; its head shall be higher like a syringe with a small cavity below where a ligament can fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the bladder of a sheep and put water into it for cleansing the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie it with a strong thread between two cavity ligaments, and heat the water a little over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then insert the end of the clyster in the vein, afterwards bind your hand over the bladder with a suitable amount of damp string, until the weak one feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If there is no bladder present for you, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce it completely from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert a thread into those holes as they are rolled up.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then gather the circle as glue is gathered; once you place within it what you wish from humidities, oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then tie it up in the instrument; make it as you did with the bladder by pressing it with your hand until moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 Chapter on Stone Extraction.
Caput LX.	 Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have said about the types of stones, their treatment with medicines, and their differences between a stone generated in kidneys, bladder, or urethra; we have also explained the operation and section for that stone, and it is a stone generated specifically in the bladder; the one formed along the vein; I am now telling this with clear explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 Therefore, a stone generated in the bladder most commonly occurs in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder like water in its subtlety; and it appears within it as white sand, and the weak one scratches his vein, and struggles with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then it becomes erect and exits together with it (the anus) in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And the healing of children is easy up to the age of fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 It is difficult in old people.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 In young people it is medium [degree of difficulty], because it is between that which is difficult and that which is easy. And if the stone is larger, treatment is easier; but if it is small, the treatment is reversed.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 When we arrive at the treatment stage, it is first necessary to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which draws out all the feces that are in their intestines; for sometimes it prevents the discovery of a Stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then the sick person should be taken with their feet and shaken and moved towards lower parts: so that the Stone may descend into the depth of the bladder or rise up from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit with his hands in yours, and his hands should be under his hips, so that the bladder becomes completely empty towards lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine him externally and touch him.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If you feel a Stone in the space, then immediately approach it with incision.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not fall under your touch completely, then you must press the index finger with oil from the left hand if the sick person is a boy; or the middle finger if the sick person is an adult man; and insert it into his anus, and examine for the Stone, until it is under your finger; and gradually move it towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the outside towards the incision site; and order the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and order another assistant to extend the testicles of the right hand upwards, and with the other hand remove the skin that is under the testicles in the part where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then introduce a Spatula cutting instrument whose shape is like this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find it (the Stone) between the anus and testicles, not in the middle, on the left side; and make the incision above the Stone, and your finger should be in the anus; and make the incision transverse, so that the incision is wide externally and narrow internally, according to the amount by which the exit of the Stone from it should not be larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 Perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses a stone during a cut, and it comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that from the stone there are angles and edges, which is why its exit becomes difficult because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And it is soft, like a gland, and round; hence, its exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 To that which has angles and edges, add in a fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not come out in this manner, then you must apply pressure on top of it; or twist it correctly, with the end resembling the moon, which will press on the stone and not escape from there; or insert an instrument beneath it, with a curved tip.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If you cannot apply pressure on it, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If something restrains you due to blood, cut it with a saw.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 But if the stone is larger than one, then push on it primarily towards the bladder bone.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut into it (the stone).
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Afterwards, push a little one after that; and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, then ignorance is to cut through it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Since it happens to the weak that one of two things occurs, either death or constant discharge of urine; this is because the location does not consolidate at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 But administer its expulsion until it comes out; or apply pressure on the fracture of it with forceps until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with turpentine, aloe, and dragon's blood; bind it up; place over it a cloth soaked in oil or wine, or rose oil, and cold water; so that the boil may settle down warmly.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then turn the patient over on his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 As you loosen him, apply olive oil and water to the place.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 If however there is a hot abscess added and corrosive, and similar things: as if blood congeals in the bladder and urine is forbidden from it; and it is known that this is recognized by the exit of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Therefore insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then clean the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply to it every kind of remedy that is suitable for its healing until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And during the entire period of treatment, it is necessary to tie two legs together and bind them, because of the medicaments that are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and it is in the intestine and it pierces it and prevents the exit of urine: then treat him with what I mentioned earlier before you reach the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For often, by this treatment, you are excused from the incision; for I have already proven that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And it is to take Perforatorium from the iron anvil, whose form is triangular at its end, sharp and fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread and tie it to the rod under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the perforating iron into the rod with ease until the Perforatorium reaches the stone; and turn the Perforatorium in your hand gradually on the same stone; and you compress its perforation until it makes it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 Urine is immediately discharged.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand on the remaining part of the stone from the outer side of the vein.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 For it is broken and comes out with urine, and the sick one is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If this treatment is not prepared for you for some reason that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut across the vein above the stone between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then extract it (the stone).
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Afterwards, untie the ligature, and clean the frozen blood which forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone unless to prevent its return to the bladder: and another ligature above, unless so that when the thread is untied after the stone's exit, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and for this reason, it is necessary for you when you tie the thread above, to loosen the skin towards the higher parts, so that it returns near the wound's edge, and covers the wound as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 Chapter on the extraction of stones in women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 Insufficiently formed stone (precipitate/stone) in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 If however it happens to any of them a stone (precipitate/stone), then its cure is difficult, and it is forbidden due to the many modes (complications).
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One of them is: that the woman perhaps is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And the second one is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to the doctor when she is chaste or married women.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 The third one is, because you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, particularly the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And the fourth one is, distance from the place of the stone: it necessitates deep incision, and there is fear involved.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If necessity forces [you] to this, then it is necessary that you take a woman-physician who knows well: and such are few found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 But if you are deprived of this [option], then seek a chaste physician, skillful, and a woman-midwife well-versed in matters regarding women, or a woman who is acquainted with the part of the art (surgery): make her present, and particularly advise her to do everything that you command her based on the investigation about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 Firstly, that it is to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that you insert your finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If he finds it [the stone], then grasp it with his finger and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the weak part (vulva) and search for the stone after she places her left hand on the bladder and compresses it with a good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If he finds the stone, then it is necessary that he moves it gradually from the bladder's opening towards lower parts with all his strength until it reaches the root of the hip bone.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then cut above it at the opposition of the middle part of the wound near the root of the hip, from whatever side it is prepared for him, and feel stone in that place; and his finger shall not be moved away from the stone, bending under it; and let the section be small in the first place.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then insert a ray over that section.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If he feels stone, then add to the section according to the quantity proportional to the stone as it exits from there.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that the forms of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 For from these one is small, and large, smooth and rough, long, and round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Know its form, so that it may be indicated to you concerning what you want on that.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood conquers you, then add at the place crushed pumice and hold it for an hour until the blood is separated.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your work until the stone comes out; and make sure you prepare yourself with instruments, which I said for the removal of stones in men, to assist you in your work.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If the flow of blood conquers you and you know that expulsion of blood is from an incised artery; then place powder on the place and tie it with a suitable ligature; do not remove it; and let the stone remain, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps a woman weak will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 And when the sharpness of blood subsides after days and the place becomes rotten, then return to your work until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 Section on a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	 Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 The translation is: "A watery growth is not anything but an accumulation of moisture in the white scrotum, which is beneath the skin of the testicle; and it is called the scrotum.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 "Sometimes it is within its own pouch which nature has prepared for it in the part of the scrotum until it is considered ripe; this is another egg, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white scrotum, which we have mentioned; it does not happen often.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 "Certainly, the generation of this (growth) is from weakness that happens to the testicles; therefore, this material flows towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 "Sometimes it happens as a result of a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 "This moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 "For indeed, its color is either yellowish-green, or bloody red, or foul black, or watery white, and it is this one that is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 "And the signs by which it is known where there is an accumulation of water are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 "For if it is in the white scrotum as we have said, then it is an abscess that is round and smaller in length like the figure of an egg; and the testicle does not appear because moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 "And if the moisture is within its own pouch, then it is an abscess that is round with part of the egg; and therefore a man becomes inflamed because it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 "And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it falls under suspicion.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 "When you wish to know the color of the moisture, then experiment with the color of the moisture in an abscess with a probe inserted whose shape has been described before.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 "Therefore, according to what exits in the track of the probe, judge about this that is within it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When therefore we come for treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you command the sick one, to be bled if it is possible for him, and see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then he shall lie on his back on a raised bed slightly, and place many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then you sit on the left of him, and command the servant to sit on the right, who extends his rod to one side of two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the scrotum.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a broad probe and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, up to near the comb: and make the incision according to the straight line dividing the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white lining enclosing it: and scrape it and observe it, or be careful not to cut it: and your scraping should be on the part which hangs more with the egg: and examine carefully with the scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then perforate the scrotum full of water with a wide bore, and drain all the water out.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate the edges of the incision with scissors, and stretch the scrotum upward, and do not touch the skin surrounding the testicles: and cut the scrotum as you are able to cut it, either entirely or in pieces, particularly the thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not examine and inspect carefully, there is no certainty that water will not return in the incision.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 If however an egg comes out from its skin externally during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the scrotum, return it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then gather together the edges of the skin of the testicles with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him as you would any other wound, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If you find an egg corrupted by another blackness, then it is necessary that you tie vessels, which are supports, fearing blood flow.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then remove the testicle with its support, and extract the egg; afterwards care for it with what I said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 But if water is gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two branches; therefore cut the other part equally according to what you did in the other one.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it is equal for you so that the operation is one, then do it; afterwards remove the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 And insert into the incisions a wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place another wool that you have immersed in vinegar and oil on the outside and spread it over two testicles, and inspect the intestines; and place on top double cloths, and they are small pillows; and tie them above with a cord that has six knots according to this shape.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then take two cloths, let them be washed and filled with carmine dyed linen, as follows: make the ends that are pressed by the iron or wet wool; and join them with a binding at the loins; and one end should reach from the anus to the back, and the second should reach from the neck part; and the two ends below should be on the lower legs, and the other two ends above on the thighs; and bind the whole binding at the loins of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery at the site of the section with iron; and there is a need for you to receive a sharp surgical cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it; and it should be ignited, as we have said, until when the white fat containing water appears; then take the cautery, as follows.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 The letters are assimilated to Greek ones.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then, pierce it along with that sifac and set it alight until all the moisture has exited.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then, stretch the sifac with forceps and scorify it with a fine cautery heated, and cut it as much as possible for you, until you have completely removed all of its root.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And beware of the egg, lest fire touches it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this operation is safer, and more distant from bleeding, and better than the operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 But if this opposes you at the time of incision or cauterization, or a boil, or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary that you take care of what opposes you from that with a treatment suitable for it, according to what was previously mentioned.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 But if the sick person is timid and does not await this operation due to its horrible nature: then administer perforation according to what I told you, and it is done.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When you are certain about it through what we have said about the meanings that the ramik is watery, then it is necessary for you to make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then, pierce the boil in its lower part with a wide spatula: and position the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until water runs out completely.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place it on a heated surface and tie it up, and allow the remaining water to drain: then take care of it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 But if there is an obstacle to the discharge of water at the time when you pierce it, and this is not due to anything other than that a white membrane opposes in the opening of the wound and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary to introduce a feather or instrument for extracting water from hydropic lesions, whose shape was previously mentioned, or add to the operation of the wound a little.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know, that water returns and gathers again after six months, approximately.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 When it has gathered (again), then it should be perforated in the same manner, and the sick days will pass through.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 Chapter on the treatment of fleshy branches (or sprouts).
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that, in a section over this Rhamic, it leads to danger in many positions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore it seems suitable for its removal from there.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I am recalling the operation in that and the appearance of the excision.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 I say therefore, that many abscesses happen in the bodies, from which testicles are composed; and this is due to various causes.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or by excessive acidity or sharpness which flows towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or by striking.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the color of an abscess is according to the color of the body and it does not find pain; and an abscess is heavy.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose color is dark and it has no sensation.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it happens from the swelling of the arteries and their expansion; as already mentioned its recall went before; or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 What is therefore from the expansion of the arteries can be known by the position of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And it is not necessary to touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 But what happens from the swelling of the veins does not discharge anything at the compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And now it is possible that this shape can be sectioned and on the other parts of the flesh; and it is, to cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then stretch the egg upward and extract it along with the sifach white; release the suspenders from the bladder, and tie the bladder; and cut the suspender after you have released it from every part of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If the egg is solidified with those born flesh, then it is necessary to draw out the egg and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is an adhesion between something from the sifach or within what is between the bladder; then it is necessary to release the entire adherence and cut it with a circular incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 If it is a birth of flesh at the site of adherence which is behind: then it is necessary that you cut through the whole of it and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; afterward, take care of it with the remaining cure until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 Chapter on the Care of Ramics (Ramie), which is related to Vine.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter LXIIII (62nd chapter).
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 An abscess enclosed by some enclosure, resembling a gourd, with the softening of testicles is caused by the vine; and it makes difficult movement, exercise, and walking for the weak.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the care of this illness, there is fear due to the memory of what preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 However, it is necessary that we say the operation in it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 I say therefore, that you should make the weak sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then push the suspender of the testicles downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with reeds that are near the rod; and let another servant hold it, and stretch it with strong tension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then cut with a broad, sharp scissor-like instrument across the length of the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then scrape off from all sides, as I told you regarding the extraction of Arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then place a needle with double thread in them and tie it at the first places where the vines occur; and tie it again at the last of those places.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut them in the middle crosswise along the length of the body, and extract what accumulates from corrupted foul moisture.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then care for the wound with treatment of other wounds, where pus is generated, so that vessels which nourish one testicle fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 It is not bad through that (method).
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 If however it happens that the grapes have rotted in all the vessels, then it is necessary to extract the testicles with the vessels, so as not to deprive them of their nutrition through the incision, and for them to rot or burn, and not be useful with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 Chapter on the care of internal herbs.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The outgrowth of this internal herb occurs from a section that happens in the siphax stretched over the abdomen in the inguinal part of the liver.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from the siphax or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 These two types occur from many causes: either by striking, jumping, shouting, lifting a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And the sign is when it is due to the extension of the siphax.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It occurs gradually over a long period of time and does not happen suddenly; it is an abscess equal in depth to the direction; therefore, because the siphax compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And the sign of it when it is due to the section of the siphax, because it causes a violent pain suddenly from the beginning; and it is an abscess different, appearing close to the skin: this is due to the exit of the intestine, and its course towards the exterior of the siphax.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it exits with the intestine, called the internal herb and the siphax; and sometimes it occurs with diarrhea.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes feces run into the intestine and are retained there; it is a danger for the sick person because it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 In the treatment of this condition's symptoms with iron, there is fear; therefore, care must be taken to avoid mishaps in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 The method of operation is to command the sick person to place their own intestine back into the concavity of their abdomen, if they obey.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he shall lie on his back upon his neck between your hands; lift up his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Next, extend the skin that follows the skin towards the upper part and cut the entire skin of the testicles along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Next, fasten the hooks of the incisions on two lips of the incision, as much as you need to open the incision with them; and the incision should be according to the quantity that is possible, so that the egg may come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the scrotum, and whatever is under the skin of the testicles until the scrotum album is hard from all sides; then insert your index finger into what follows the testicle, into what is between the scrotum album, which is below the egg's skin, and between the scrotums according to it, and without the adherence that is in the back part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move with your right hand to the inner skin of the testicles; and at the same time, stretch the scrotum album upwards with your left hand; and lift the egg with the scrotum album towards the part of the incision; and command the attendant to extend the egg upward; and you loosen the adherence that is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And search with your fingers if there is nothing there from the intestine rolled up in the hard scrotum album.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If you find something from it, then push it down to the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take a needle with a thick thread made of linen from ten threads; and insert it at the last scrotum, that is, the membrane beneath the skin of the testicles following the incision; then cut the ends that project from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then compose some of them over others with a figure in the shape of a cross, and bind them with alsifach, which is under the strong ligament of the testicles, until no fluid from the vessels that nourish them can pass to them; so that no hot boil may occur there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 Then position another ligament beyond the first one, at least two fingers away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligaments, let two ligaments of sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, be removed in quantity equal to the size of a digit; and then cut the rest completely in round shape, and remove the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then, on the lower part of the scrotal skin where blood and pus run, make an incision as we have previously said.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the ligament as we have said.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes cauterize the white sifach that was mentioned after making an incision, to prevent bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 This often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 Leave the ligament until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 If the case does not heal on its own, then embrocate with hot water; and place on it what was said before until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then care for the wound as is the treatment for wounds, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 Chapter on the Poultice of the Ram.
Caput LXVI.	 Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this poultice of the ram, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And first they said that it is made as previously described in the poultice of the vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 This is to bind the vessels after cutting them at a lower level; then cut it in the middle, and later heal it with what opens it, until the vessels fall out; and care for the wound as previously said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 "On disruption which occurs in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	 "Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 "When rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and there is a protrusion of the location that does not extend to the testicles from the intestines; but if it does extend, it is slight, and returns in all hours: however, if this condition persists with the same time, a tear is added in the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 "And this occurs from the extension of the scrotum, which is in the groins, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 "What happens is that the scrotum extends; then it becomes softened, the location is pressed out.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 "And the care for this is with cautery, as was previously mentioned in its narrative.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 "And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method: and it is as if the weak person lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 "Then cut the location of the rupture and the protruding part with a section across its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 "Then tie the scrotum and, what is beneath the skin, until the white part of the scrotum that follows it is revealed.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 "Then take a probe and place it on the protruding part from the scrotum and press it deep into the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 "Then make two protruding parts at the end of the radius from the scrotum and connect them with a suture; then remove the end of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 "And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor stretch the testicle, nor anything else, as I have told you in the treatment of intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 "Then treat this with wound healing.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 "When you make a cut, clean it and restore the wound until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 Sisach is contracted and no eminence is added for Rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And the cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 Chapter on softening the scrotal skin.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 The skin of the testicles is frequently softened in some men, due to which the meats between them become soft and its appearance is spoiled.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the one who asks for its cure to make the weak person lie on his back, and to cut the entire skin that has been softened over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then gather two flaps with stitching: and if you wish, or preferably, remove the excess of the softened skin with three or four stitches, and make a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then take care of the healing of the remaining wounds until they heal and the thread falls off.
¶ De Castratione.	 Section on castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 Know that castration is forbidden by our law; and because of this it would be permissible for me not to remember it in my book; and the memory of it is not necessary unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One reason is that this should be known by the physician when questioned about it; and so that he may know the cure for one to whom it happens.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And another method is that we often require castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, hogs, cats, and similar ones among animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 Therefore I say, Castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by making a cut and division.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In the one that is done by attrition, the method of operation is this: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and become tender, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and are not noticeable when touched.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 In the castration by making a cut and division, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then bind the glands and cut above all of the eggs with a single section until when two eggs come out: then cut those where you have scraped off the skin from both, and do not leave anything on them except the membrane that is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than the one by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something from the testicles, for which reason the animal desires coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 Chapter on the care of hermaphrodites in two methods.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 Hermaphroditus from males is according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is when it appears in him that follows a gap or in the skin of the testicles, in what is between two testicles, with the figure as if it were a female vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine runs out from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women there is one kind and it is the female wolf on the forehead like small male testicles protruding to the outside; one of which is like Priapus in a man, and two like two male testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 The treatment for the three kinds, two from men and one from women, is as follows: because it is necessary to cut the added flesh until the impression of them escapes.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then treat these wounds with the remedies for other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 For the second kind of men's species, from which urine comes out, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is any treatment for it at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 Section on the incision of tentigo (itch) and protruding flesh in women's ulcers.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 Itch is perhaps added to what is natural until it becomes ugly and its appearance is disfigured; and sometimes it grows so much in some women that it expands like in men and reaches as far as intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hold the excess itch with the hand or with a tweezer, and to cut; not too deep in cutting, especially in the root, so that there is no bleeding.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat this with the remedies for wounds until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 Flesh that arises is the flesh that is born in the opening of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it comes out to the outside like the tail, for which reason some call the disease tail-like.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut this as one cuts an itch and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 Section on the treatment of alratic ulcer, which is a female wolf that has not been pierced through.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 The arterial vessel of a woman should not be pierced, or it should have a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 It is either natural, or it is accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 It is accidental due to the preceding illness; it occurs either from flesh born along with it, or thin, or thick; and it takes place in the deep of the womb, or in its sides, or above it, or below it; it forbids coitus and impregnation, parturition, and possibly menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 Its recognition is made by the observation of an obstetrician, if the opening is apparent nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If it is not apparent, then search for it with your fingers, or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the opening is from thin flesh and is close to two lips: then press it, and break it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 It is as if you put two small pills on top of the lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place your index fingers of both hands simultaneously, and let the woman be above her back with her legs spread out.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then stretch the two lips forcefully until the thin flesh is torn and the opening is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take wool and dip it in oil, and place it on the spot; let the woman sit on it every day to prevent the location from being closed by another thing.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 If the flesh is thick and hard: it is necessary that it be cut with a broad, flat leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If the opening is from flesh born along with it: then hang it with hooks and cut it; have with you medicines that stop blood flow without cutting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and resin of onion mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a large cannula made of lead to prevent the wound from closing quickly; hold it for several days; then apply linen cloth, then treat the rest with healing, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes birth occurs in the matrix of other flesh: therefore it is necessary that they be cut as follows: while it is not a cancerous aposteme, for the aposteme which is in the matrix is not at all contrary to iron.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 On the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil and Bothor concerning redness in women's private parts.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the veins' orifices, until much blood continuously flows out from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 Since therefore hemorrhoids become hardened, they become piles: and I have already said in the division of their types, and the signs of them; and here I will say what receives treatment from them, and what does not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the matrix's opening and do not appear to the senses: then there is no treatment with iron for it.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those which are on the matrix's opening over which falls the sense, are those which can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore it is necessary that you introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then Athehelil spreads out with forks, or with a rough cloth, and cuts them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then powder over them at the flow of blood from one grinding stone without crushing it: such as ashes of oak, dragon's blood, and pitch, and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then push his feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Then put her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the flow of blood persists: then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate bark, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, and knead it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If therefore blood is cut with it (the instrument), it is good: and if not, let adhesive plasters be applied to the back and nipples, without making an incision.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take linen and dip it in the juice of tarathit or arnoglossa or aglanter, that is, elm bark, Pontic wine, and apply it as an adhesive.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When therefore the abscess has ceased to be active, then treat the spot with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 Albareth (Albucasis) is red and resembles the heads of al-hassa, and it has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, it must be cut away as I mentioned before in the text on thelesion, and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 Chapter on Perforation of the Expelled Fetus in the Womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter LXXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 In the womb many types of abscesses occur, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, adubelas, alekilas (herpes), fistulas, hemorrhoids, ragadias, thylili, and hot abscesses.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And I myself have already said all these diseases and their types, their signs, and their treatments in another book: it is necessary that I say here about the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, which is one of the abscesses that collect pus, and to know how to make its opening with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 If the pain of the abscess is sharp at its beginning with striking and burning and fever, and you see it turning red when it touches the senses, then do not proceed with perforation: instead treat it with what helps its maturation until the sharpness of symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat which has two armrests, and she should recline or lie down on her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of her abdomen: and her thighs should be spread, and she should place her arms beneath her knees, and tie each with a band appropriate for that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the tool to open the opening of the matrix (womb).
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 Whose shape comes after those that are posterior (in position).
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And it is necessary that when you administer this tool, you probe with the rounded end of the woman's matrix to ensure that what enters from the tool is not deeper than the depth of the matrix and injures the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If the tool is deeper than the depth of the matrix, then it is necessary to place pills on top of the covering of the deep part of the matrix: to prevent the entire instrument from entering into the deep part of the matrix: and it is necessary to place a stirrup on the upper side which runs in the instrument: and to hold the instrument and to turn the stirrup, until the deep part of the matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When the expulsion appears, and it is touched with the hand, and it is soft and yielding: then it is necessary that she herself separates herself from her head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary to place a linen cloth dipped in rose oil or green oil, with some styptic substance on it: and place the linen cloth, and make an incision in the deep part of the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And place outside on the matrix and on the comb, a clean wool cloth dipped in water in which boiled mallow has been steeped.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it is cured after two days with an ointment suitable for that, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the matrix (afterbirth) and wound are cleansed, so that they are washed with water and honey; then, after washing with water in which the root of the lily has been boiled or long aristolochia, return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound is hidden internally within the afterbirth, then it is necessary that treatment with iron be prohibited for it; rather, treat it with what was said in the section on division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Doctrine of Childbirth, how are fetuses that have come out unnaturally alive to be treated, according to their figure.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter LXXXVI.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for the Midwife, first and foremost, to know the form of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 Therefore, among its signs is that when you see a woman being pressed towards the lower part, and she desires to smell the air and is alleviated above her in the area of childbirth, and hastens the exit of the fetus; then you shall know that this birth is according to a natural figure, and it is an exit over its head, and the second one with it: either hanging, or suspended by the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 If you see these signs, then it is necessary to press her abdomen so that the fetus descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 For when it descends over its head, the second one comes with it, and it is cleaned from these excesses with a good cleaning.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But he who is outside of this birth is unnatural, inadmissible.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 For sometimes the fetus comes out over its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet or one hand; or only one foot; or its head and one hand; or the navel; and perhaps it turns over its neck, and similar unadmissible figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in these matters, and avoid error and deception; and I am showing every figure from them, and how the intellect is present in it, and it will be indicated by that, and it will stand over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus emerges from its natural exit, and it becomes strong upon the woman, and delivery is difficult for her, and you see the force of her weakening: then make her sit on a chair, or let women hold her; and apply warmth to her vagina with boiled fennel, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 The midwife should insert her little spatula between the fingers and separate the second [finger] with it, and cut it with her nail, until what is within it from moisture runs out; and press the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 If it does not come down, then it is necessary to enema the woman with a decoction of fennel mucilage and sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then order her after the enema to be tightly bound; and make her sneeze with a powder, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 The fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary to draw them back gently.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If she does not obey at the entrance, then put the woman on a chair, and raise her feet upwards; then strike the chair on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If the hands do not come out and the fetus dies; then cut them, and extract the remaining fetus; tie the hand with cloth and extract it equally; for it will come out by itself.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 Delivery of the embryo through its foot.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus comes out through its feet, then push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards extract it equally.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one of its feet and stretch it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they [the instruments] have advanced up to the hips, then command him [the patient] to apply pressure, and make her sneeze with powder: it will come out if God wishes.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 If it does not come out as we have described, then gradually draw back the fetus until you place it in its natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 It will then come out easily with delivery.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 If it is forbidden with what we have described: then take from the resin of althea, oil of sesame, and dissolved gum; grind it all well in a mortar by good beating; afterwards anoint with it the womb of the woman, and below her stomach.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until she feels the afterpains.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 When you see that the lower parts have become heated, then give her a sip of myrrh and place it under her.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When an hour has passed, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make her sneeze; and pinch her nose and mouth; and press the lower part of the womb gently.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 The child will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 Delivery of the Child above the Knees and Hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it comes out in this manner, then he [the midwife] will insert his hands gently.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman lies on her back, with her feet hanging downwards; and she lies on the bed, and clasps her hands together.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Press gently above the womb.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then take out what is under her feet from the breeches and prepare it below.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 If the child does not come out, then take hold of his feet and move them forcefully.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press gently above the womb until the fetus rises to higher parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then insert your hands, and press the fetus gradually: and command the woman, to compress until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 The fetus, hanging obliquely from the hands, has come out.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 He makes an incision for reducing that hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 If it cannot be reduced, then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 But if she cannot walk, then lay her on a bed: and strike the legs violently.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then administer the ointment which you have prepared from mallow.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 If she receives it in labor, then let her sit on a stool.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then strive in reducing the hand and press the fetus according to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The fetus has come out on his neck, with spread hands, and his face is towards the back of his mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it over and press it gently.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it is pressed, then place it on the wound that I told you about, from oil and mallow.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then command her to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that, then let her sit on a stool, and command her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then command her to compress: and make her sneeze with powder.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The fetus is prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it descends through the mother's opening in this manner with the placenta, then cut the placenta with your nail until it separates from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If the fetus hangs on its face and neck, then make an incision from the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus towards the inside until you place it as required; and command the woman to press herself several times; for it will come out easily by itself.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 Delivery of twins or multiple fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 Know that twins are often born, and there are times when three or even four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 Nevertheless, this is unusual and rarely occurs.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 Five is beyond nature and do not live long; and it contains them, even though they multiply, by the second one; and they are separated by the siphunx (a type of instrument), distinguishing between them bound at the umbilicus of each one.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 Sometimes they come out as a single fetus does with a natural easy birth; and sometimes they come out with an unnatural exit, as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them are difficult during childbirth and reach the state described in the unnatural figures, then care for them as we have described; and let a skilled midwife be there, and she shall do what she does with ease and slowness, and innovate according to every figure with that which is prepared for her by her skill leading to safety.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Remember this: what forms in the womb from embryos and miscarries.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes it forms in the womb as one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten; and it has been verified by me that a woman has miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 What was done with the measurement of the wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, this must be in the knowledge of obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 For perhaps it may reach a similar state; therefore, let her oppose it with what is necessary (for treatment).
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 Chapter on extracting a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Head, LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you treat a dead fetus as I said in the division of medicine and it does not come out, and you must operate with your hand, then it is necessary to consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If the woman is of good health and not with any accident that is feared for her loss, then it is necessary to make the woman lie down on a bed on her back, and let her head be inclined lower, and her legs raised: and the attendant should hold her from both sides or tie her to the bed so that her body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then wet the mouth of the womb with moist oils (such as) olive oil, mallow gum and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the midwife will wet her hand with those oils and gums, then she will insert it into the womb easily.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then she should seek with her the place where to grasp the hook from the fetus and places suitable for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Therefore consider then if the fetus is ready to descend onto its head: then seize the hooks in its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its beard, or in its armpits, or near its ribs and below its hips.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If the descent is on its feet, then seize it at the breastbone (sternum) and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary to hold the hook with the right hand and place its head between the fingers of the left hand: and insert it with the left hand easily, and seize the hook in one of those places that we mentioned, until it reaches the empty space (vagina).
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then seize another or third hook with the opposite hand if needed, to have an equal contraction and not to decline to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then it should be extended equally, and the extension should not be only in a straight line, but rather it should move to all parts, so that its opening is alleviated: as it happens with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And it is necessary for what is between it [the tooth], that the extension be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If a part is retained from it [the tooth], then it is necessary that the midwife insert some fingers with oil, and insert them from that side, to turn with them what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If, therefore, a part of the fetus comes out, then change the forceps to another higher place: do this until the entire fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If a hand or other part comes out first and it is not possible to reduce it due to its dislocation: then it is necessary to cover it with a cloth.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then pull it out until when the entire hand comes out, cut it either at the joint of the foot or at the elbow: and thus you should do the same with the other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If the fetal head is large, or there is a dislocation in its exit, or water has accumulated in its head: then it is necessary to insert a pointed spatula (Spatumile spinosum) between the fingers and break the head with it, and extract the water; or tear it apart with the instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter following this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly, do the same if the fetus has a large head by nature, then it is necessary to cut off the afterbirth (algenge) with scissors; or pull it out with misdach as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then pull out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head comes out and becomes dislocated at the neck, then it is broken, until the moisture that is in the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 If it [the wound] is not complex and does not follow the direction of exit: then cut the head intermittently, as much as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If it [the tumor] is below the abdomen or there is hydropsy [edema] within it: then it must be punctured until the moisture runs out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 But if the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the bone of the matrix [pelvis] is gentle.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If it [the dead fetus] is twisted within the abdomen or chest: then it must be extracted along with a cloth you have wrapped around your hand; and pierce the abdomen or chest until what is within them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If other parts are removed and the head returns: then the midwife should introduce her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the bone of the matrix [pelvis] is open, then insert your hand deep into the pelvis and search for the head with it; and draw out the head with your fingers as far as the bone of the matrix: then insert a hook or hooks and draw it out along with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the bone of the matrix [pelvis] is twisted due to a hot tumor that has occurred to it: then one should not labor over it, but rather administer liquid medicine with moistening properties and oil; and apply poultices; and sit in baths that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is on its side, it can be turned: then administer what I have said for a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If it cannot be turned, then it should be cut intermittently and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And one must not leave anything from the afterbirth completely inside.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 When you have completed your operation, then administer what I have said for hot tumors that occur in the matrix [pelvis].
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If bleeding occurs, then lower in water and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 I myself have already seen a woman, whose womb contained a dead fetus; then she conceived again on top of it, and afterwards another fetus died as well.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 A long time later, a boil occurred on his navel and it became swollen until it opened up, and started discharging pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I was therefore called to treat him, and he was treated for a long time; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 I therefore placed on it some strong adhesive plasters; and bone came out of the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then a few days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I was therefore astonished because there was no bone in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 Therefore it occurred to me that the dead fetuses were from bones.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I therefore examined the wound and removed many bones while she was in a good state; and she lived like this for a long time, and now discharges little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 I did not reinforce this foreign matter here unless because there is knowledge and help for that which the skilled doctor administers with his hand in healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 Chapter on the necessary forms of instruments for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here below is the shape of a Stricktor, which makes equal books, having two equal spindles at both ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 However, this spindle must be more refined than the Stricktor; and it is made either of ebony or of boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the width of all wood should be as thick as two fingers; and the edge of each of both is as thick as one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half, or more but less; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood there are two additions made of the same kind of wood, which have already been secured on each, whose length is half a palm and more, and width as thick as two fingers or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 These two instruments are inserted into the matrix's bone to open it when you rotate the two handles.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The form of the handle used for opening the matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another shape similar to it but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 Make it from ebony wood or boxwood, in the manner of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 However, at its end there should be two extensions, as you can see here above: and the length of each extension is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 When you wish to open the matrix with it, then have her sit on the bed, with her legs spread apart, opening what is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two extensions connected together into the matrix: and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount that you wish from the opening of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 The form of another handle mentioned by the ancients, known as the Pusher, used to push the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The form of Almisdac, which crushes a large head; it is similar to forceps but has teeth at the end, as you can see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it is made long like forceps in this shape, as you can see, with teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The form of Almisdac used to crush a small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The form of the uncus (hook) having one spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The form of the uncus (hook) having two spikes.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The form of forceps with saw-like teeth used to crush the fetal head.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The instrument called Spatumilis has two ends for cutting off a head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The form of the broader Spatumilis, too, is of two ends.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 All these instruments are applied [in surgery], and the more their variety multiplies, the better prepared they are by the craftsman for their use, and taller among men due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not disregard from those instruments one which is prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 Indeed, the necessity of these things is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 Section on the Extraction of a Second Tooth.
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII [on the extraction of teeth]: The method of removing a
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the Second Tooth is retained during childbirth, then it should be instructed that it holds its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with the fingers in her nostrils and press your hand over her mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If it exits through this method, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If it does not [exit]: then take the pot and perforate a hole in the lid; and put inside herbs opening the mouth of the womb such as wormwood, rue, anise, chamomile, thistle, wood-betony and centaury; take all these herbs or some of them and submerge them with water and put them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place an embolus of reed on the opening of the cover pot's hole, and hold the other end on the bone of the matrix; and let it remain until the vapor reaches the concavity of the matrix.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 For it will come out easily in second.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then order the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil or aloe mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then insert your finger into the womb and search for the Second.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When he finds it, then take it out gently and stretch it slowly.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If it is attached deeply within the womb, then insert your hand as previously described until you find the Second and extract it gently according to its direction so that it does not fall out violently; rather, it should be moved gently from side to side; then a counterbalance should be added.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 For it will yield then, and be saved, and exit from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 If the bone of the matrix is twisted, as we have already said: treat it with sneezing and with medication from the pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 If it does not come out with all that we have said, then take care not to tire yourself in the repeated extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 But what comes out of the bone of the matrix from there, tie it to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then cleanse her with tetrapharmacon ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 For it will rot her after days and dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 However, when it rots, raise the bad smell from her stomach and head, and injure her weakly.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, it is necessary that appropriate fumigations are administered for that.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Certain of the ancients had already tried fumigating with dried figs and watercress.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The shape of the tool for fumigating a woman during retention of afterbirth and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Make a tool like a bellows or a tube, and let its wide end be over the fire; the fumigation shall be placed on plums; hold it until that fumigation is consumed; and repeat another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 Chapter on the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born whose anuses are not perforated, which the syringe has already cauterized with subtle sifak oil.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, the midwife should perforate it with her finger; and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp spatulum; and let her be careful, lest she touch him.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then place over it a linen cloth dipped in water and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with ointments until he is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 If one fears that it may burst open, then place a tube of lead into the hole for many days, and remove it when the boy wishes to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And now, anus may burst open due to consolidation of wounds or abscesses.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut that consolidation, then take care of it as we have said in the treatment and with lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 Chapter on the treatment of fistulas occurring in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 The fistulas that occur in the lower part are swelling (Nodatio) and swelling that occurs near the outside of the anus; or in the space of one part; and it is a single fistula or multiple fistulas.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 When therefore that ancient nodulation is opened, there flows out from it watery whiteness or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 Sometimes they are penetrating from these fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, they are recognized by what is discharged from the opening, and with windiness, when the sick uses the purge; perhaps a worm is discharged from it.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 These are fistulas when they penetrate into space up to the bladder, and up to the meat of the verge.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 These are penetrating up to the joint of the hip, and up to the knot of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From that, it is known which penetrating fistula is up to the anus, even from one not penetrating, by inserting your index finger into the anus; and inserting a probe gently into the fistula from air or iron when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is a twisting in it, then insert into it a probe gently made of lead or a horsehair, until you feel the probe or the hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything from the discharge come out of the opening, nor windiness, nor worm as I said; then you will know that it is not penetrating; therefore approach for treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the fistula is penetrating up to the bladder or urethra; then the sign of it is the discharge of urine from it, and the prevention of it from this place so that the location may be strengthened with medications.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 But if it is penetrating up to the hip joint or hip bone; then the sign of it is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twisting as far as the bone; and the pain is found around the part, and there is always a discharge of pus from it; and the medication does not work in it, nor is it strengthened with an ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 In these fistulas penetrating there is no cure at all; and the cure of them is pain and futility to him, over whom a fool among physicians is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 In what is not penetrating, and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a scalpel; as I tell you, and I have already proven. And there lies the sick one upon your hands on his back; and tear the legs of his up to his hips, and let his hips be inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then insert a lead or copper rod, if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know where the probe has reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 If the sick one feels it around the anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 If therefore you feel the probe has already passed through itself, detected by your finger and between the probe and anus or flesh; then you certainly know that it is penetrating, not to labor in it because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They say that in some men the flesh heals, and from the medication which is hoped to be helpful for him, it is, that you cauterize with a subtle fire, according to the size of the fistula, as before, and insert the burning substance into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then do this twice or thrice until you know that all those added fats filtered, which are similar to feathers of a bird's quill, have been burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then care for it with linen strips wrapped in butter until those fats burned come out; then care for it with ointments that produce and solidify flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If therefore it heals, good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it shall never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 If it breaks out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh between it and the wound, or if you see a Fistula on that which follows the skin surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the Fistula, and you go cutting with the wound what is in the fistula until the incision reaches where the end of the wound is, and the wound is released and falls off.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then clean those fleshy areas resembling a bird's feather quill, so that there remains nothing of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If blood prevails and breaks through between you and the operation, causing those fleshy areas to separate: then it is better to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Since cauterization with fire brings about good conditions, the heating of those fleshy areas, the coagulation of blood, and the drying out of moisture is added.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then treat that with linen folded in butter or cooked reeds until the place emits pus and the burnt fleshy areas are discharged into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments that cause hardening of the flesh; there are medications containing styptic and drying agents.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when it is restored, then it heals; do not be afraid to repeat the treatment.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 If the Fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is elongated from the body: then insert your finger into the anus and examine it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 If you feel a membrane between you and it, which is of flesh or skin, and is close to the penetration: then there should be no operation on that unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 That is because it (the lesion) is administered in one of three ways: either to cauterize it as we said; or to excise it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert a linen cloth and cure it immediately.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed much with the excision, so as not to cut the muscle containing the anus, and may there be an unfortunate outcome of expulsion without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then treat that as we said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 Perhaps it will heal: or stretch out the membrane and cleanse it after cutting it as we said, either with a bladder or with another sharp-tipped instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then cleanse the fleshy parts that are cut, as far as you can examine them.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then attempt the healing of the entire wound together with the excision and the superior opening where it is consolidated: and there remains an open fistula in the internal part of the anus, which will be less harmful to the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes a fistula is drained in this manner: and it is when you insert the bladder into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus: then take the perforated-tip bladder, which is like the aleskef beak, that is prepared hides, according to this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a thread rolled up from five strands, and around that.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the bladder with the thread into the fistula, until you reach its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it is piercing the edge of the anus internally nearby, then pull out the thread from that hole: so that you insert your finger into the anus and pull out the tip of the thread, and tie together both ends: and tighten each end, and let go of it for one or two days: and as much as the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until the tissues between the ends of the thread fall off and drop away: then treat the wound, until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 If however the orifice of the Fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way you prepare it, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For you there is no need to do so, that you should cut the arm because of it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then proceed as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The shape of the spatulum for the fistula with a very sharp edge, whose surface is highly curved and one part is not sharply curved so as not to cut what is not necessary, as you can see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 On the suture of hemorrhoids from which blood flows upon their incision and care for fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Or they are within the anus, like bladders of charcoal or prunes, or as if they were grains of millet.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And some are small and large; blood flows from them always, and there is one and many of them.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 And they are outside the anus and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 Nevertheless, those that are outside the anus are of few in number and moist with juice that runs a small amount of lemon water or a little blood by constant course; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And the care of that which is within the anus is to command the weak one to fast: and it is expressed until it comes out the anus, and appears to you as atheles.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore also hold them with tweezers or keep them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If they are not held by the tweezers due to their moisture and softness; then take them with a rough cloth or with a glove made of double wool and remove them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them (the vessels), and sprinkle some warm powders over them after the incision to keep them in place for the cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not obey the evacuation, then cleanse the sick person with a small purgative enema, so that it cleanses what is in the anus, and let him obey the evacuation quickly when he expels himself, the sick one.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 But if they are external ulcers from the anus, then their state is light and easy: and it is to grasp them with your nail or with a pair of forceps, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with what I said before, until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And whoever recoils from the incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer a suture for them in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take thread wound round and insert it into the point (of the needle).
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then draw out the ulcers upwards, and make it penetrate with the point into the root on the other side: and wind the two ends of the thread around the needle, and let them be broad: and tie the ulcer tightly with a strong suture.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then knot the thread and draw out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all ulcers, and let one of them remain free: nor should you yourself cut it, lest excess blood flow from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then put on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or pitch, and place it over the anus: and tell the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then let him go until he falls asleep.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Since the ulcers fall off, care for them with ointments and the rest of the treatment, until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For they occur frequently due to drying of feces and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 As they become old and medicine does not work on them, then it is necessary to shave with a spatula or your nail until they become moist and the outer skin layer that prevents healing is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then treat them until they heal as required.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If they do not heal, then shave them again with a more vigorous incision than the first, until they bleed much and are drained. Then treat them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 On the treatment of ulcers that are turned inwards and not inwards, as well as scrofula (Athelil) and anthrax (Formicae).
Caput LXXXII.	 Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 Know that Almirmar is not anything other than a round node similar in color to the body and resembling a nailhead. It occurs throughout the body but mainly in the lower parts of the feet and fingers, and it causes pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 Therefore, it should be cut off at the base of the nail and held with forceps or a nail puller and pulled out by its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then care for that: and if you wish to cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 Furthermore, there is one elevation that is small and rough, filtered, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And it often happens in boys' hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 And its treatment is to stretch the little finger and cut it; or stitch it with silk thread; or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine; and now the little fingers that have turned are being removed, not the ones that have not turned with the tool that I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 Moreover, there is also a small, filtered elevation that is large on the surface of the body and goes very deep; and when it is found cold, it feels like the bite of an ant on it, and it spreads throughout the body; and it most often happens in hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 And its treatment is to take a reed from a goose feather or the strong feathers of an eagle; and place the reed over the ant bite so that it contains the circle formed by the reed on its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then rotate your hand with the reed until it separates from the edge of the ant bite; and place it in the deep flesh and remove the ant bite by its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, do this with a reed of metal or iron, in this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 Let the upper end of the reed be pulled upwards to a height and turn it over so that it relieves the finger and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you wish, cauterize the ant bite as was mentioned regarding the little finger in the chapter on cauterization of little fingers.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 Chapter on the shapes of instruments used for enema administration in diseases of the anus, and solutions of the abdomen, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Head LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 When the clyster is made of silver, or gold, or copper melted, or beaten.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes it is made with small and large instruments, according to those in whom it is administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore, what is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose anus are weak or painful, so should their clysters.
Clistere magnum.	 Large clyster.
Cistere paruum.	 Small clyster.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The head of the cannula, that is, the upper part where it is tied to the uterus, should be wide according to this method; and it should have a separation so that it can be tied to the uterus as you see, and its lower end, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, that is, not open, soft, very, drawing towards fineness; and on one side of it should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And let the size of the hole be according to the thickness of the fingers, and slightly larger, and let the uterus in which the medicine is placed be from the bladder of an animal; or from a sheep's skin, which should be small, like a little sow's ear: whose root should be one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And let it be pierced with many holes as it is rolled, and let the space that is between every hole be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into the holes a thread perhaps from raw yarn, which should be from ten strands or about that, and bind it with it like a little sow's ear.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When the uterus is placed in it, the head of the clyster should be tied with strong constriction at two distinct points.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then clysterize with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the shape of the circle depicted here, and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of clysterizing with it is: to fill the bladder or the sac from medicine which should be heated according to the tolerance of the sick person; and take care that it is not too hot nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the sick person lies on his back and raises his legs towards above; and put under him a cloth or skin upon which people lie.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then anoint the end of the clisterium with oil, or with white goose fat, or with mucilage of fenugreek, or similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then let the servant take the bladder with both his hands at once, and squeeze it forcefully until all that is in the clisterium passes into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the clisterium, and the sick person raises his legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine forces him to leave, then hold as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps through that night with it, it is more effective for healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 If you clisterize him in the illness of the bladder and he desires to leave quickly: then clisterize again until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If there are hemorrhoids or wounds in the anus: then let the clisterium be very subtle, soft, from clisteria with which children are clisterized.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this is the form of a soft and subtle clisterium, over which the skin is rolled.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 Chapter on the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Chapter XLII (Roman numerals).
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 I have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds that it belongs to a book; here I will tell you about their treatment with hands and with medicines according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, wounds are distinguished according to what kind of wound they are and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 Therefore, wounds are like a stone thrown: or by sword cut; or struck with a spear, wood, arrow; and similar things of many kinds.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that are made according to the parts of the body are such as a wound on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or back, and similar ones from those members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am telling the treatments for certain wounds, so that I place the reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the reminder of the compositors will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore (I say).
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 If a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no bone fracture, consider then if it was caused by a stone or similar object, and it has only broken the skin; and the wound is large, and you fear an abscess of hot pus; then act quickly, and make a venesection of the head immediately; and do not delay this; and draw out from him according to the strength of it as much blood as possible, unless there is something prohibiting venesection, especially if the blood flowing out of the wound is scant.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let the venesection be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 And take care that the sick person does not fill himself with food or heavy drinks.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If something prevents reduction (the amount of blood), then reduce from the food, and let him not approach meat or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And place on the wound if it happens to him an abscess of hot pus, boiled mustard seed in rose oil only, or with wine in which there is wormwood.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 If you are safe from a hot abscess, then place on the wound if it is recent with its own blood, and has not changed the air, the powder which I will tell about in a moment; and if it has already changed the air, then place on it some unguents until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If the wound is large or made by a sword cut and similar ones: and its edges are not brought together by pimples, then gather it together with suture, according to what I will tell regarding the wounds of the abdomen in their suturing.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If the wound has already been found from the bone and hangs, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspension: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh in its place where there is a scar, and instruct the sick person to eat foods with thickness, such as heads and cooked wheat, until it becomes soft; and similar ones.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 And if you find a rottenness in the skin that does not adhere to the bone: then cut out the entire rotten part, and throw it away; then care for that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it cannot be cut off by medicines, then investigate above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If you find it not cut, then cut it with a spatula or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 And if necessity demands when it does not provide what has been said, then cauterize it until the blood is cut off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If these wounds are small and simple, then the matter is easy and light; so that you sprinkle this powder on them; because it consolidates them before air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 § Method of the Powder for Consolidation.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt lime; grind it all very well, and sieve it; fill the wound with it, and tie it tightly, until it adheres well on top of it, and coagulate with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then tie the same above with sutures, and leave it, do not loosen it until it remains, so that it does not come undone.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 The medicine is not to be uprooted from him until he is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And at times plaster alone does that, when there is not olibanum or dragon's blood at hand for you; and also lime performs the same operation in many deep wounds when it is applied upon them and they are sutured, and the wounds are recent with blood that has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 If air has already altered it in some way, especially during the summertime, then there is no use for this powder; so take care of it as we have said, placing on them certain digestive unguents, or place on them poultices made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until pus is emitted.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of the rest of the cure until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 But if it happens that the wound is a fracture of the bone, and it is slight, then extract it with trepan (Gesti); and now I shall tell you the treatment for fractures of the skull which will follow.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 Chapter on Neck Wounds.
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If a wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment compared to a simple wound of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If the nerve or artery of the neck has already been cut, if it is a nerve, then there is no skill in its treatment except that care must be taken to avoid causing violent constriction, such as ziniar and zegeh, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Because they harm nerves and cause them to contract.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not place anything cold at all on the wound; because the substance of nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain which is above the organs; so let that which is used for treatment be from soft medicines such as plaster mixed with sweet water several times infused with oil or rose oil, or tuthia when it is washed even with sweet water; and other mineral stones, in this manner, and moist unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If a wound is large, then administer suture; or sew it up with tied flaps and small pieces of wool.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If there is depth in the wound or if a cavity forms at its lower part and already accumulates pus, then puncture it deeper in that location.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If an artery has already been cut in the wound and blood flow is obtained: then separate or sever it and tie it; or cauterize it if such a need arises.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If the windpipe (spondile) has already been severed, completely or partially, and the trachea is saved: then sew up the skin flaps with suture over the wound in the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe; instead apply it evenly and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then tie it with a suitable suture and leave it for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with ointments containing styptics (styptic substances) and astringents until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then probe it; if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all such fragments that you can; leave what cannot be prepared for this purpose until the wound decomposes and separates and heals from its outlet.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If the wound is recent, then sprinkle it with powder as I described earlier.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If a bone appears in the wound and a fistula forms: then treat it as described in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 Chapter on wounds caused by spatha (sword or spear).
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a wound caused by a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then assess the situation.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If from a wound there comes out pus, when sick with breathing from it, then you know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If there is no depth to it and it is fresh with its own blood: then do not put powder on it at first hour nor bind it, so that the blood does not remain deep within it and returns to the heart and kills the sick; but put ointment of attraction on it and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If ointment is not present to you, then put on the wound's opening an old piece of clay, so that it absorbs what comes out from it due to humidities: and make the sick person sleep over the wound, so that it runs towards it and gathers together in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If three days or more have passed from the wound and no spasm occurs in the sick nor a bad heart tremor nor tightness in breathing, and you see the remaining dispositions of it good: then you know that the wound is healthy.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Treat him (the wounded person) with linen cloths and the rest of the treatment until he is cured.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If healing is exhausted in him and it is always opening, then you know that it has become a Fistula (fistulous tract).
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Treat it (the fistula) from its root.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 If the wound is from a sword or knife cut and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what preceded from suture, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 If the bone has already made an impression and cut pieces from it: then examine the wound and rush to extract those pieces, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 If they are not separated, then leave them until the wound decomposes; for it is useful to extract them when it has decomposed.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 The judgment for treating wounds on remaining members, is the judgment that we have mentioned.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 On wounds of the abdomen, and the exit of intestines, and of their cure.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 A rupture that occurs in the abdomen, is great, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 From a great one, at times, intestine or number of intestines exit.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Therefore, their insertion and suture is stronger and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 And a small rupture also becomes difficult by another manner.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore, their reduction becomes difficult if you do not hasten to its insertion to its place immediately; because it swells, opens, and grows larger; therefore, its entry becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore, it is better for a medium rupture to be operated on; because with this one, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 Know that the suture of the abdomen is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two common sewing methods come together in the abdomen and in the suture of other body wounds; and two other sewing methods properly belong to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 Nevertheless, they are more proper for the suture of the abdomen; and I will tell you each one with its explanation and clarification.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore, when a wound is small and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it is difficult to reduce it; then this is because of one of two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said; or because there is swelling in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 When it is like this, then it is necessary to warm it up, so that you immerse a sponge or damp cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Boil in water the bladder of a squirrel, cyperus, pepper and myrrh, and mix them with the affected intestine until the swelling is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes it makes wine in which there is a stoppage; and it is better than water alone for the resolution of swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 When you see that the swelling has already been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which artemisia or wormwood has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For this reason, a small amount of an alum solution is applied to its opening.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If the return has not yet been restored after this treatment, then fill up the opening slightly with a tool used for cutting hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when prepared, than the operation; and there should not be a forced cutting after necessity and lack of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other not sharp; and let the tip not be thin with the subtlety of a needle, but rather slightly blunt; and it is the one that resembles an onion, as you can see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its return be in its natural shape at its proper place, if possible over it; because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 But when the opening is large at the lower part of the abdomen: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then raise the head and chest higher than the lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly if the opening is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then your aim and attention should always be that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And so, it should be admitted into large wounds and into medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 In small wounds, place it as you have prepared it.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make sure that a faithful servant is present at your hands, who holds the entire rupture with his hand: and bind the lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then, cut out some thread for the one who follows to sew something after something: and this is the common method of suturing one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is that you receive a needle or a number of needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then, from the end of the rupture, let a space of one finger width, that is, of the physician, be left: and sew the needle once through the skin in two places where the sifac, which is under the skin, comes out from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side: and you have already bound together the two edges of the skin, and the two edges of the sifac: and four rows are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then sew with double thread around the point of the needle repeatedly from both sides until the two lips of the wound are bound together properly.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then leave a thickness equal to one finger and sew another needle there: afterwards draw it with thread as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Therefore, do not stop doing this with the needles that you need until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 And let the needles be of a medium thickness between thin and thick: because very fine needles easily pierce the flesh; and large ones are difficult to enter the skin; therefore they should be of medium thickness in both fineness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 And it is not good to sew the needle through both edges of the skin closely together: so that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound opens before its healing; and so that they are not lengthened even when sewn, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the end of the onion so as not to harm the sick during his sleep; and place small pieces of cloth from all sides around the end of the onion; and let them be until you know that the wound has already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 This type of stitching is more suitable for small wounds with onions like this.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Because one or two needles are sufficient for their sewing, or about that many.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second type of stitch is common, to gather with the stitching the ends of four: the ends, two skin and the ends two sifac in place of one, with a needle containing an equal thread in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then when you pierce with the needle these four ends, bring back the needle from the side where you began, so that the thread dropped from the upper part of the wound remains retained; thus the stitch will be like a seam stitch for sewing fabric, and place between each stitch an amount equal to the thickness of a little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 This type of stitch is known to humans.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this stitch I sewed my own wound that happened to a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was larger than one palm; and there came out from the intestines about two palms of intestine from the middle intestine, and the rupture was in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 Therefore I brought it back again after the intestines of his had stood out of the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 The wound has therefore healed in the space of about fifteen days; and I cured him, and he got well; and he lived after that for many years, converted to his own ways.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And physicians had judged that he would not get well.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And it was a miracle that I did not cure him with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Since I was in a place where no ointment was found nor any medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 I therefore placed on the wound an old pot two times a day, and I attended to its cleaning with water of honey until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 I will speak of two types of stitching as described in the narrative.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it begins with sharp stitching: and you insert a needle from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the needle penetrates into the skin, and along the length and width of the entire body: release the end at the side where you inserted the needle, and let it penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside in the opposite side with a thread.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When you have made it penetrate there, then let it penetrate thus in the same side thread with a needle from the outside to the inside: and release the end that is on this side, and let the needle penetrate another end from the inside to the outside: and let it penetrate together with your penetration which you make it penetrate in the side thread at the other end of it, until it reaches the entire thing.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then begin also from this side, and pull out the same with the end that is on the other side of the thread: and extract the needle from the skin where it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then return it to the same skin and pull out the other end of the thread on the other side with this end thread: and extract that from the skin at that side, and do one side, then the other: and do one side after the other until you pull out the entire thing according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 And the sum of this stitching is that you do this stitching of skin as it is made with skins: thus one side of the thread from one end of the skin: and you release it on the other side at another end, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 Second type of suture, as Galen named it.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This speech is told as to sew it in the same way that some physicians do, by joining every part to its corresponding part by nature: and applying the end of the sifac to another end, and the end of the mirach to another end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And this is done as I told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 It is necessary that you make the point of the needle near the end of the mirach on the outside part, and let it penetrate to the inside only; and you release the two ends of the sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then turn the needle and let it penetrate from the outside to the inside through both ends of the sifac, namely on each side.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both (of them) and let both penetrate from the inside to the outside through the other two ends of the mirach, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of suturing is better than the common easy one, and it is the suture that was previously mentioned.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 This is also the speech of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And they said some.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The abdominal suture is reinforced with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 What is meant is that you insert one thread into each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle from where it is with you, and let it penetrate to the other side according to the equal suture of those who sew leather.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then the suture of it is more difficult than those of the other parts of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment of the medicine for the wound, is the judgment of all wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 What is meant is that when you seize a fresh wound with its own blood before it changes into air, and reduce the bowels, and attach them, and prepare them; then put it on a bed of dry powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 If the wound has already changed (rotated): then place on it certain ointments which are present to you until it produces pus; and the threads fall out, and it heals up, and it becomes firm again.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat that wound as you would any other wound, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 But if no medicine is present to you, then immediately place on it something old, from which pus begins to flow; and change it twice a day as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not require other medicine in many cases, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 But if you fear that the wound may affect the main limbs in injury, then it is necessary to immerse linen cloth in oil of mild heat or rose oil; and place it around the areas that are between the groins and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If it feels pain, or punctures, or rotting in the intestines (for this often happens), then cleanse it with a potion of warm wine, black, steeped: especially if rot has already reached the intestine and made it perforate to the concavity of it.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know this, that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal; and that which is from the small intestines is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine which is called Jejunum does not heal from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its abundance, because it is made up of veins, and the size of these veins, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity to the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 But if what comes from the wound is worms, and you follow it recently: return it according to your usual method of returning intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the time has passed and it has already turned green or black, then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place where it has become blackened, so that there is no bleeding.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For in it are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of the thread hanging from the bottom of the wound outside it: to alleviate the attraction of it upon you, and the removal of it in case of accident, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Reminder of the wound that occurs in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is a small rupture in the intestine, it is possible to be restored in certain people: because I have seen one who was wounded in his abdomen with a lance strike, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound had been old: and it became a fistula, and discharge occurred from it, and flatulence.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 Therefore, I applied a treatment until I was not convinced of its healing: nor did I cease to probe it, until it was healed, and the place had solidified.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I saw the place already solidified, I feared for the sick man, that an accidental evil might occur in his abdomen: and it did not happen to him from that accidental evil.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in better conditions, eating and drinking, and passing urine, and entered the bath, and exercised in his diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And some of the experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and is small, then it should be tied in this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And it is to take ants with large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then gather two lips of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth on both lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When therefore it falls upon that (thing), and contracts its bone, cut off its head, for it adheres and is not loosened.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant next to the first one, and do not cease doing that as the ant after the ant according to the size of the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then draw it back, and suture the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is eaten, and healed, so that no harm comes to the sick man deeply.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And now it is possible that the intestine can be tied also with a fine thread; which was removed from the animal's intestine, attached to it when it is inserted into the point.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And there is, that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and much of it is excavated.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a fine linen thread at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert the thread into the point and suture it with the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then draw it back to a disjoint state.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is not except by the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that, a large wound, wide, especially if it is on one of the slender intestines; then there is no skill except subtlety, nor is its healing entirely.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 Chapter on Zucchum and Fistulae.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that every wound or boil when it becomes old and decayed and turns into an ulcer and does not consolidate and always emits pus and is not incised; then it is universally called in whatever member it may be a Fistula, and we call it Zucchum.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And indeed a Fistula is in truth a hard, white, filtered nodule; without pain, which has the hollow of a bird's feather; and for this reason some call it Risati, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And it is in some hours moist, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And perhaps humidity is divided in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And sometimes this humidity is much, and it is little; and it is thick, and it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And now I have already mentioned the division (referring to wounds), that every ulcer which does not heal, is not born of flesh within it, is not that except for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its maliciousness; or because hard flesh is between it and the skin, preventing the growth of flesh; or because there are many sores and putridity; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is discharged from it is of poor quality; or because the medicine is inappropriate for its healing; or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, as it happens in Caesaraugusta: where digestion of diseases becomes difficult, and the healing of boils slows down naturally; or because there is one bone or number of bones in it.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 And now I have shown all these causes and their signs, and the cures of them along with medicines in the division; and here it is necessary that I make you know the cure for fistula and ulcer, which are made through the way of surgery with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Know therefore, that fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For from these come fistulas that reach to the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or intestines; or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs; or to some of the spondylus (vertebrae) of the back, or to some of the joints made up of several parts: such as hands and feet; and from these come those that approach the proximity of the main member and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 Which of these fistulas is so according to this manner, is one of difficult cure, and does not receive treatment, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If it is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach those places which I said and you hope for, trust in its cure and wish to attain knowledge about it, then take a probe made of copper or iron, if the fistula tends straightly, and explore it with the same.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 But if there is a curvature in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin probe of lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Since lead, because of its softness and bending around the curvature, is suitable for this investigation.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to sign upon it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Therefore, close one of its openings from among the openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 Since the moisture which you introduce through closure runs back to other openings and flows out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then investigate and examine carefully according to the method which is possible for you: so that you know whether there is a bone or nerve where the fistula has a hollow depression deep or shallow; or it is a single fistula with many openings, and stands over all of it, when exerting your utmost strength, when questioning the sick person, and finding pain upon compression by your hand on the place, and similar indications and signs of injury.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 When you have stood at your true station over all of it, then proceed to treatment according to confidence; and you should consider whether the fistula is near the surface or in a distant safe location away from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or single spot among those I have mentioned to you. Then, if this is so, cut the fistula as previously stated in my narrative, remove what grows within it by filtration and corruption of flesh which arises in its opening or cyst or similar things; and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If however the Fistula is of deep depth and is straight: then it is necessary that you cut it as deep as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then clean it from all the rotten flesh of it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then apply a linen wrapped in sharp medicines and insert it up to the concavity of the Fistula which you have seized with iron. Do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine has corroded all that remains in the concavity of the Fistula due to corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 But if it does not heal by this, then cauterize it as we have said before.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of the Fistula is bone, and it has been certified to you that this is so: then investigate it, and cut it according to what I have told you. If it does not prohibit you from anything from the vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If it is determined to you that there is bone with something corrupted and blackened: then grind it away until the corruption of it has been removed entirely.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what causes it to heal, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If it does not heal and emit pus as it did: then you will know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Investigate therefore above it again and examine its reason, and clean it with utmost force of yours.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If it heals, that is good: and if not, then you will know that the corruption is in a deep remote part of the body which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 It is not for you in this matter, except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If a small bone is corrupted and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps which fit it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If many bones are present, then carefully draw out all of them, do not leave anything from them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If something prevents you from it due to the moistures, and there is no fear or mistake in the incision of them: then cut those moistures and fleshes if they are present, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If you are not prepared to remove the bones from your time, then place it on the wound so that it rots itself and leave it until it rots what is around the bones from fleshes and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And tighten the incision which you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Or place it on top of it if you fear it, cotton soaked in crushed sulfur with oil; or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those moistures rot and separate the bones, the removal of them will be alleviated, and the drawing out of them.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 If there is a large bone such as the leg bone or hip bone and similar ones, and what is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the last rasp, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If what is corrupted in it is a large part and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it entirely up to where the corruption reaches; then care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you about a case that happens to a man in his leg: so place it as an example and aid on your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 A man of about thirty years old had pain in his leg due to a cause that moved upon him within the body, that is, from the inside, until the matter reached his leg, and he was cut out with a large incision: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 The time was extended with the error of the physicians until the abscess was opened, and much matter gathered around it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 His treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: all of which discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 A multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no skilled hand in his care until I was called and saw his leg, and the matter running from those openings in a great course: even the entire body of the man was already wasted, and his color was jaundiced.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 I then inserted a probe into one of the openings, and it reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I examined all the openings: and found that they penetrated into one another from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I then approached, and cut open one of the openings until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already rotten, decayed, putrefied, perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 I then sawed what was exposed to me from the rotten bone and prepared it for removal.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I decided that there was no bone but only the corruption, which I cut off and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And I had already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed a dressing on the wound with consolidating medicine in a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it is not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried and opened the wound above the first finding: and I found continuous corruption with bone: and I scraped what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 Then I attempted a restoration of it.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 I therefore opened it again, and did not stop cutting the bone piece by piece, and attempted its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut from the bone about one palm's breadth, and pulled it out with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I restored it with medicines, and it healed quickly, and was cured: and this repetition in the operation and section of it was not necessary, except for the disposition of weakness in the patient, and his lack of tolerance, and my fear over him regarding death; because bad syncopes from excess evacuation occurred to him at all hours.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 Therefore, it was cured completely by healing: and new flesh hard grew at the place of the bone, and good arrangements were made for its body, and his strength returned: and he turned back into his dispositions: and no harm whatsoever was done to him in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 If however the prominent bone at the place of the body has already been broken: then it is necessary to scrape it, according to this method: and it is as follows: take a ligament, and tie it at the end of the prominent bone; and command someone to stretch it upwards; and place another larger ligament on the first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then bind it over the flesh that is near the bone; and extend its end to pull the flesh towards the lower parts; and you will scrape the flesh above the place which you want to scrape, so as not to harm the scraper.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place a stick or board under the bone below it well placed; since when you do that, it is not forbidden to cut corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 It is necessary that the Serrature be above the corrupted place, so that there is no corruption of the bone in a concavity: and it does not appear to the sense in its appearance, and it compels another for its Serrature.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is corrupted and not projecting but rather adjoined to a part of it, and the corruption is in the middle or part of itself, then excise all the flesh from all parts.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place the stick underneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Then saw it from one side where the corruption is, until the saw meets on the other side: and let the saw be according to the length shorter than the corruption as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If the corruption is at a joint, cut the corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it adjoins from the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 But if the corruption is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no skill but to remove it by grinding.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If the corruption is in the beak of the hand or foot, then there is a great difficulty in that matter.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 However, you must examine the corruption to see how it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And grind it away and cleanse it according to whatever position is possible for you, and with whatever skill it can be corrected for you: when it does not cause opposition to the Vein or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that these bones for cutting and sawing are many according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their sharpness, their size, their smallness, their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an appropriate tool for every type of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations indicate to you the type of tool that you need according to the nature of your study when it requires long effort.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the methods of this art, bears witness to the modes of illnesses: then you shall find for yourself what is suitable for it from the instruments for every affliction.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I am strengthening you with the number of instruments at the end of this chapter, which you shall place examples upon as you carve, and proof on others as you try.
Forma Serrae.	 Form of a Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 Form of Another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Form of Still Another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Form of Yet Another Saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This form of the saw should be well-made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Make its upper part an arch, sharpen it with iron; and let the handle be made of boxwood, and it should be well-formed.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 Form of a Razor for Joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 The head of this rasp should be shaped like the head of a star-shaped nail; and its points should be shaped like the points of a file.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 It is not suitable unless it is used to smooth the heads of joints when they are broken or for a large and thick bone.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 Form of a Larger Rasp.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 Form of a Middle-Sized Rasp.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 Form of a Broad Rasp.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 Form of a Rasp with a Convexity (concavity).
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 Form of Another Fine-Toothed Rasp.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 Form of Another Rasp with a Curved End.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 Form of a Small, Fine-Toothed Rasp.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 Form of a Rasp for Cutting Bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Also the form of a Large Rasp.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 It is similar to a Drill and its end is like a Saw; it is used in many places when cutting bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 Form of a Rasp suitable for cutting the bone that has been bored out.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 The extremity of it (the limb) is a triangle, sharp-angled.
Fit ex Indi.	 It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly, it is necessary that everything which we have said should be made from files, incisors, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 [Section heading: On the Incision of Extremities, and Bone Sawing]
Caput LXXXIX.	 Head LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 Rottenness occurs at the extremities, either from external causes or internal causes.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 If you have treated that corruption with medicinal remedies but it does not improve and you see that the corruption is spreading in a limb which does not respond to any treatment: then it is necessary to amputate that limb up to where the corruption stops, so that the weak one may pass through it from death or from the greater evil caused by loss of part of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign that this happens is that the limb turns black until it seems so: what fire has burned it or rot has occurred after turning black: until the corruption reaches that part of the limb which follows it and creeps throughout the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Therefore approach it for amputation and similarly if the cause of corruption is a blow from some venomous creatures such as sea-scorpions, weasels, nettles, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If the corruption or blow occurs at the extremity of a finger: then amputate the finger and do not leave any space for the corruption to spread, so that it may not reach the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it happens in the hand: then amputate it at the root of the wrist and do not leave any space for the corruption to spread until it reaches the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it invades it (the hand or arm), then amputate the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If however the corruption passes beyond the elbow and you see it: then there is death for the weak one.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And any treatment beyond that (the amputation) is a quantity of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly do the same for the foot when corruption invades a toe: then amputate it at one of the joints; and if it reaches the front part of the foot: then amputate the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If it [the abscess] rises to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 If corruption [of the limb] has already reached the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for amputation, and leaving the sick to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 The method of cutting a member or sewing it is to tighten the ligament below where you wish to cut and tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And stretch one of the ministers [assistants] to the lower parts, and stretch another minister to the upper parts.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the flesh that is between two ligaments with a broad spatula until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it is cut or sewn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And it is necessary that you lay a flax cloth over all the parts and not touch the healthy place with the knife; and let an additional injury be added to the sickness, and let a hot abscess come out.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 If there is bleeding internally while you are working, then quickly cauterize the place or put some powders on top that absorb blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your care until it [the wound] is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded member with a suitable ligament and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you what happens to a man in his foot, the same thing that I have told you will happen.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 What happens is that there occurs blackness in the foot, similar to burning like fire; and corruption starts first with a toe until it covers the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 Therefore the man was ashamed of himself when he saw corruption occur in his limb with intense pain that he discovered from the pain and burning; and he cut it at the joint, and he healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long time had passed for him, the same corruption occurred in the index finger of his own hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 Therefore, it came to me, and I attempted to recover that excess with what I placed on his hand from the medicines after mutilation of his body; but it was not found, and it began to progress to another finger; until corruption started in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 He called me to cut his hand; but I did not want it, hoping for a recovery of the excess [of fluid]; and I also feared death due to the incision of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Because the strength of the man was over his fall.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 After he had given up hope in me, he returned to his own land; and he came to me about that [incident], because he had hurried and cut off his whole hand; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And I did not bring this narrative unless as aid for that which falls under the genus of this disease; and as signification, and according to how it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 [Title: On the Treatment of Sinusitis, and the Quality of Enemas with Medicines.]
Caput XC.	 Chapter XC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When an abscess occurs in some fleshy parts, and the space of the abscess continues until it makes a collection of pus; then it breaks or perforates, and what is inside the pus comes out, and leaves a hollow place as if it were a vessel; and the skin that is above it becomes thin like a cloth that has been softened; and it does not reach its final corruption, nor press on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament; it deserves to be called Sinus; but it is not called Fistula; however, if the space continues until corruption presses into one of these organs, then it is called a Fistula, or a boil.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And its treatment is to cut the whole skin as it rolls out; and especially when it has been softened and made like a cloth; and trust that it will not stick because of its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If you think that it adheres to the skin and does not follow by that ultimate corruption: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then treat it with a poultice; and it is, that you consider for the sinew.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 If it is large, and the pus that comes out of it has a foul smell: then poultice it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and zinc oxide mixed in equal parts, heated in a vessel until the medicine turns red and thickens to the consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take what is needed from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and poultice the sinew with it; and bind the opening of it, and leave the medicine in it for two hours' quantity.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then remove it with pressure: make this daily until the sinew is purified and the foul smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And when you are not able to use this medicine, poultice with water and ashes; and it is, that you take the ash of grape wood, or the ash from oak trees, and throw water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then cook it well, and poultice with it until you are confident that the sinew has been cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 If the patient is not able to bear the Egyptian medicine or water and ashes, then poultice it with water and honey, into which something from crushed zinc has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or poultice it with honey and wine mixed, since the property of honey is to cleanse and purify; and wine holds the sinew, especially when there is an excess of stiffness and dryness in wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 When you are certain that the corruption of the sinew has been removed, then poultice it with what causes flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And it is to be noted that from the plaster dyafinicon, you shall dissolve it with rose oil and stiptic wine, or you shall purge it with certain medicines and other unguents, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on unguents.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 If the orifice of the Sinus is narrow and does not accept a cannula for cleansing, then expand it slightly with iron, or place within it a linen cloth rolled up in Egyptian ointment, or in Basilicon ointment until it expands.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly, if the orifice is also wide, then approximate its lips with suture, and allow the amount in which the cleansing can enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly, if the orifice from which pus flows is elevated towards the superior, then cut it at a lower place that is within it so that pus runs out below; since when pus is constricted in the depth of the Sinus, it prevents flesh from generating in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus below as you wish, then try to prepare a limb so that pus can run out from it with ease according to your preparation.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try not to retain anything of the pus at all in it; and take healing medicines that are placed on the sign, which suit your purpose.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 Spread them out on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 Let the linen cloth be of such size that there is communication throughout the whole Sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then make a hole with scissors directly in the orifice of the Sinus, larger than the orifice of the Sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then spread a layer of soft ointment over another cloth, according to the size of the hole; and place it above it at a distance from the orifice of the Sinus so that the exit of pus from it is relieved; and do not remove the large cloth unless after several days in succession.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 He who is above the opening of the Sinus should be removed at all hours so that what accumulates in it due to pus may exit; and know, whether what flows from it is much or little, digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And again, consider the place of the Sinus itself, whether its master feels pain there or not, and whether there is an abscess there or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 Since your treatment is so extended and you see the material that exits from the opening of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus already adheres or approaches adhesion; then therefore dissolve it in the morning or on the third day; and when you dissolve the wound, then change the linen and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 If, however, pus flows out of the Sinus for a long time, do not despair of its adhesion, for healing is approaching; because there are some who have a slow generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are others who act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 If, however, for many days an undigested pus flows out of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus is not adhering.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 Therefore, if the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed and its treatment prolonged; then add to the drying remedies, but let the doctors ensure that they are in substance moist and in effectiveness dry, such as ointment dyafinicon when superfluous addition is added from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the most remote treatment is that you receive ointment dyafinicon, which is dissolved with rose oil and shaken over it ancient wine equal in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then make it with this and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now do the same with this action when you are not present ointment dyafinicon, honey, when you cook it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Receive myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind it all, and pulverize it on honey while it is over fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then cover it with linen cloth and bind it over the bladder: and line it with honey that you have boiled, until it thickens; and sprinkle powdered spices over it, and place it on the linen cloth and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And at times, long aristolochia, celestial lily roots, and lily itself are administered: and the flour of herbs, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them in simple form or compound, grind them and sift the powder: and sprinkle it over the honey that I have mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the bladder prolongs and is not cured by this treatment: then know that there is corruption within it: or it already makes an impression on the bones, or in other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with fistula cure, according to what has been mentioned before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 Section on panaritis and the scratching of the nails, and the addition of a digit incision, and section.
Caput XCI.	 Chapter CXI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Panaritis is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb or foot, and perhaps arises in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 If it prolongs and is neglected in its treatment, and is abscessed with hot abscessing: or it becomes corrupted and emits pus until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts it completely, and the corruption reaches the bone, until there is a foetid smell; and the end of the digit becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When you treat it, when you have done what I have said in division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you scrape off the entire superfluity that remains from the nail with iron.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then cauterize the wound afterwards.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 Indeed, cautery is very beneficial.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If the bone is healthy and so is the nail, and there are empty additions of the nail that press the flesh towards the inside and begin to pierce it and injure it; then it is necessary that you place fine radium under the edge of the nail that pierces the flesh, and push it up; and cut the flesh easily, and put on top of what remains of the flesh from medicines that burn, corrosives, until it is removed entirely.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If the corruption has already pressed into the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and remove it; for a rotten bone will never heal while it remains in there.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see that corruption and decay are advancing on the finger, then cut it at a knuckle, as previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 If the nail should happen to be rubbed or struck and a very severe pain occurs, then it is necessary to use the phlebotome first on the weakened.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut the nail with an acute cross-cut of the spatula from above as desired.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And beware that the cut does not reach the flesh that is beneath the nail, for you will cause a very severe pain to arise above it and this will lead to an addition of flesh at the site.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then care for the place with something that alleviates the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 The finger added to certain human hands is possibly all flesh; and it may be that some of them have bones, and it may be that there is a nail in it: and some of them are born at the joint of the root, or its birthplace is in some knuckles of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 Therefore that which is born in certain knuckles of the finger does not move; and that which is born at the joint of the finger may possibly move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 Therefore its cutting is easy if it is all flesh.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 It is to cut it at the root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 But its care is difficult if its birthplace is at the joint of the root.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 In that one which is born at the end of the finger at a knuckle, then it is necessary to cut the flesh with a round cut until the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then cut the bone with a saw that fits among those suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 However, the consolidation that occurs in fingers often happens multiple times either due to birth itself, i.e., being born with it, or from a wound consolidation, or burn by fire, and similar conditions.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, the consolidation should be removed until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place linen or cloth soaked in rose oil between them to prevent quick consolidation and separate them; or put a thin lead plate between them until the location is healed as required.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then remove that consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable for the member's shape.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 Chapter on the Fault of Incision.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter CXII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 Wounds are swollen veins, thick, filled with melancholic fluids that occur in many parts of the body; and most commonly they occur in legs, especially in the legs of travelers and laborers, and those carrying heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore, it is necessary to administer a strong purge for the body at times due to black bile.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then, let the bloodletting of the patient be made on the basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 The cure for them (swellings) with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One of them is, that they should be lanced and black blood be drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And the other method is, that a vein shall be opened up and all drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 Cutting is done according to this method (lancing).
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 Pour a lot of hot water on the leg first, until thick, foul blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then bind the weak leg from its upper part of the hip to the lower part of the thigh with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut the vein at one or two or three places in a wide cut.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then draw out the blood, that is, extract it with your hand from the lower part of the leg upward, and it is necessary for the leech to attend to the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut the nail and draw out from the blood as much as you see is sufficient, and as much as the strength of the patient can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Afterward, bind it (the wound) and tell him to abstain from foods that cause black bile; and repeat the purge and bloodletting when the veins become filled, and this is harmful to the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The drawing out (of pus) is done according to this method (opening a wound, draining it, then applying a poultice).
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 If the leg of the patient has many hairs, shave it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then introduce it into the bath, or apply embrocation to his limb with warm water until it turns red and veins appear; or exercise it with strong exercises if there is no bath available, until the limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then dry the skin directly on the vein incision along its length; or in the end part of it near the knee, or in the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with combs and scrape the vein from all sides until it becomes sensitive; at its appearance, as you see it turn red towards blackness.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When it has departed from the skin, you see it white like a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert radium under it until it rises and comes out of the skin; hang it with a blind comb, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then make another incision nearby that incision with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then scrape the skin from the top of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then remove it with radium as you did before and hang it with another comb as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then make another incision, or several incisions, if necessary.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then remove it and cut the last incision at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then extract the part that is above the incision.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 Do this until you have extracted it from the higher incision, or all the incisions, until it comes out entirely; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If it does not obey you to be extracted and removed; then insert a sharp needle with strong thread and tie it and extract it yourself; or insert radium under it and move your hand over all parts until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And be careful not to cut (it).
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to remove it and from that it causes harm to the sick person.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 When you have removed it completely: then place linen soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, on the wound site, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If it is a vine (grapevine) with a twisted shape and coiled at parts, not as we have said in a straight manner: then you must make an incision over all its twisted parts and the coiling sites of it.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then hang it with hooks until you have pulled out the entire thing: and be careful not to cut any vein or wound during your incision; for it will be difficult for you to pull or extract it if you do.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Therefore, exercise caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The method of treating a vine (grapevine).
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The method for treating a blind boil.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 Its scab is not like that of other boils, nor is it sharp-ended so as to pierce a vein; and it is rather large and flexible, soft; for if it were subtle, it would pierce the vein with its subtlety; on the contrary, its excessive size is superfluous, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 The method of extracting a leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated in the warm lands of Egypt, as Azizgi said, and in the dry, hot, sandy areas with little vegetation, that is, where no herbs or trees grow.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 Its generation is indeed from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as it happens in the bodies of snakes and roundworms (ascarids) and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 The sign of this vein's emergence is that it occurs when there is a severe inflammation of the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then let the area be bled.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 The vein starts to come out from that spot of bled area, like a root of plant or animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When it appears from that end, then it is necessary to wind around it a piece of lead, whose weight shall be one and a half drachms, up to two drachms and a knot; and let the hanging lead be released from the arm.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Whenever something comes out of it to the outside, wind it around with lead and knot it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it prolongs much, then cut a part of it and wind the rest.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut its root before it comes out completely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 Because if you cut [the ligature], it contracts and enters the flesh; causing an abscess to appear, a bad ulcer and pus.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore, it should be treated gently and slowly extracted until it comes out completely and nothing remains in the body; and from this vein there comes forth in some men what is of its length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has come to me, because the man has come out of twenty palms (i.e., 20 cm).
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If it is cut during your treatment, then insert a rod into its opening and perforate it with a long rod along with the body until all that is inside it from the matter comes out; and administer medication for decay of the place for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then care for it with treatment for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or on the foot itself; and openings occur for it in several places, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Take care of it as we have said in the division, and with what has been previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 The ailment concerning worms generated beneath the skin is called Bouina.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This ailment is called Bouina in a certain land among us: because it often occurs in cows, and there is a small worm born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 It moves throughout the body, ascending and descending; and it is revealed to sensation during its movement from limb to limb, until it bursts at any place where it bursts through the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 Its generation is from the corruption of certain fluids.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 Just like worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms, occur in the abdomen.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 It is feared because of its mischief.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it moves within the body and rises to the head and arrives at a place, then perhaps it opens there and emerges, and destroys an eye; and this often happens.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 Therefore, when one wishes to treat it and extract it, this is not done except during its movement and the appearance of it to sensation.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 Therefore, one must bind what is above it, and what is below it with a strong bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut on top of it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it has penetrated into the flesh, and you do not find it; then apply a hot iron to the place until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And the greater thing that is feared is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind under it with a good bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut on top of it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 It is necessary for the sick person to use self-cleanliness of his body, with medicines that dissolve foul, bad fluids.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And let them avoid food causing putrefaction to themselves.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 On Section for the Ailment of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This ailment is known in our land as Nakir: it is a pain that occurs in certain members, then it shifts from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And I myself have already seen it, as I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was called to a sick woman in some villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And she extended her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after staying for an hour, I saw the swelling moving with a worm-like motion, quickly ascending to her shoulder as if quicksilver flows from one place to another.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 Therefore the pain left that place and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then she sat for an hour, and it ran throughout her body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then she told me that she was revolving in her entire body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 I marveled at the swiftness of its shifting from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And I myself had never seen this ailment with my eyes before in such a way as now.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 Yet I saw many who found pain shifting from member to member: I did not see it as I did in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that it was anything else than because the woman was from those who are from the villages of the detected veins: hence it appears that the swelling was shifted.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that it not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delicate and moist bodies of concealed veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 When therefore you wish for the cure of it and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to you with the eye, as we said, then tighten above it, quickly beneath it; cut above it until that constrained wind escapes; cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If you do not see it with your eyes: then cure it by excision of the body and with that which expels winds, and crush them with foul-smelling pills and pills of turpentine, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter XCVII.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows are classified according to their types and according to the places where they fall on the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 The diversity of arrows is as follows: because there are some that have large points and small ones; concave or blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And there are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And those with tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And those with stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 Those that fall on the limbs are twofold according to mode.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 Or limbs are from the hollow members like brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestines, bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When an arrow falls into one of these hollow members and you see signs of death as I am about to tell you, then it is necessary to seek the extraction of that arrow from them because death follows him who has it in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when you do not see these bad signs and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it yourself and heal the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 From the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone, and exits on the top of the brain, are: because from this occur soda vomiting, scotoma, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasm, confusion of intellect, and cholera vomit.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out from the nose, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And perhaps speech is cut off and voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And from the wound place comes out whiteness similar to plaster.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And out of it comes forth like a watery flesh-like substance.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment and remove the arrow if it does not come out by itself.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are as follows: that it is near the left nipple; and it feels as if it is fixed in a solid rather than in a soft thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps there is motion similar to the pulse movement, and blood runs out from the wound in black color.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 It follows this coldness of limbs, and a cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Know therefore that death approaches without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is as follows: foamy blood comes out from the wound; and containers that follow the neck are to be removed, and the complexion of the ill person changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And it breathes out a large, high breath and seeks cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls into the abdomen, which is in the chest; then it is near the small ribs; and a great panting with strong pain occurs along with sighing, and all limbs of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 And if the arrow falls into the abdomen and lodges there, something like feces comes out from the wound or pus, or an already disrupted intestine.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore, there is no hope for his cure, nor for removing the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out; and something proceeds from it to outside, and the pain is stronger over the sick person; then know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The remaining limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, spatula, aid, dorsal spondiles, crossbar, hip, leg and similar members are to be healed according to several dispositions: when the arrow does not hit an artery or a nerve; and the arrow is not venomous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you what I saw of these arrows, that you may know by it concerning your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 It is, because a man had fallen an arrow into his tear duct of the eye, at the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore I extracted it myself from the other side, under the ear fat of him; and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen on him under the lower eyelid of his eye; and the arrow was already hidden, and I only obtained a small part of it, which adhered to the wood of it; and the arrow was large among the arrows of the Turks, with a soft iron, in which there were no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 Therefore the Jew was healed, and no harm came to his eye as a result.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 And it was an Arabian arrow, and he has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 Therefore I cut it across in two; and it was already immersed in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 I therefore sharpened myself with it, until I extracted it; and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I extracted another arrow from a man who had fallen it on his abdomen; and we thought that he would die as a result of it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After thirty days had passed without anything changing with regard to him in his treatment, I therefore cut across the arrow; and I sharpened myself on it, and extracted it; and he was healed, and no harm came to him as a result.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man to whom an arrow fell upon his back, and the wound was healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 And I saw a woman to whom an arrow fell into her belly, and the wound was healed over it, and the arrow remained within her; and no change occurred in her condition from her disposition, and the woman did not find any harm to herself in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 And I saw another man to whom an arrow fell on his face: and the wound was healed, and remained, not causing him much pain; and similar things happened many times.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 And I extracted an arrow from a prince of the king that had fallen on his nose, which had already turned slightly to the right side; and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 Therefore, I was called for its treatment after the loss of the arrow up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 Therefore, I found the wound of the arrow to be very constricted.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 Therefore, I probed it with a delicate probe, and did not feel it; but he himself found a puncture and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 Therefore, I hoped that the puncture was at the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 I then covered the spot with a plaster containing an attractive and digestive agent, trusting that the spot would open up, and I would see the sign of the arrow so that I could cut it; but this did not happen in the place that indicated that the arrow had struck.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 Therefore, I kept the plaster on him for many days; but it did not happen, and the wound became more and more consolidated; and he remained weak from its extraction until he felt the arrow one day within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me that (it is).
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 I then applied sharp and corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened; when I probed it, I felt a subtle tip of the arrow adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added through the opening of the wound a sharp medicine until the arrow tip appeared visibly to us; and it passed by me during about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then when the wound was swollen, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not obey to come out; then I did not cease sharpening, and working on it with means of ingenuity, until one day with well-made forceps, according to the form they would take at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I healed the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed physicians judge that cartilage of the nose cannot be restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 I therefore healed it, and the wound was consolidated, and became healthy again in a strong health; nothing harmed him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the quality of extracting some arrows; that you may place this rule and meaning on what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Since the parts and distinctions of this art are not comprehended with the narrative; nor does that book contain it, and the wise craftsman compares little with much; and with what is present, regarding what is absent; and he finds a new operation, and a new tool among descents of things foreign to this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 I therefore say that arrows do not come out from the members on which they are fixed, unless in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or by attraction from the place from where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Opposite part of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which comes forth where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place and is both attracted and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 If it does not obey to exit at the time it falls: then it is necessary that you let it be for some days until the flesh around it decomposes and the attraction disappears and its exit takes place.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly if it is fixed in a bone and does not obey to exit, then let it be also for some days; and move and shake it every day until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 If it does not obey to exit after several days, then it is necessary that you pierce around the arrow on the same bone from every side with a fine chisel in order to make the arrow swell up.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then attract it and pull it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If the arrow is fixed in the skull bone and has reached one of the ventricles of the brain and symptoms such as those mentioned before appear: then refrain from pulling out the arrow and let it be until it becomes equal with its position after several days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if the arrow has reached the heart, death does not extend to it.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not fixed except in a bone only and does not penetrate up to the heart; and it remains weak for some days and does not suffer from any of the symptoms mentioned earlier: then apply skill in pulling out the arrow and its attraction.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 If it is very firmly fixed and does not obey to your pulling out: then apply a chisel around the arrow as I told you earlier; then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 If the arrow is already concealed in a part of the body and hidden from sensation; then seek it with probing.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If however you feel it (the part to be operated), then draw it out with certain instruments suitable for its drawing out.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you cannot go over it (the arrow) due to the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrowhead; and there is no bone, nerve or vein there: then pierce it (the arrow), until the wound expands so that the arrow can be pulled out.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If there are ears attached to it (the arrow), then free the fixed flesh from all sides, in every way you can; and the instruments, if it cannot be moved by simple pulling on the flesh of the ears, and by twisting them, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And you, when you perform the extraction of an arrow, wherever it is located: then use twisting with your hand, together with pliers in all directions, until you make it come out; and gently, with the utmost subtlety, so as not to break the arrow, and its drawing out becomes difficult for you, and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot move it within an hour: then leave it for several days, until what is around it (the wound) becomes putrid.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then return to it (the arrow): the dressing (tunic) will heal by itself. If however a flow of blood opposes you: then administer what we have said in its treatment as described in its chapter; and take care to avoid cutting any vein, nerve or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And apply all means of pulling out the arrow in every way possible for you; and let it be with ease, calmness, slowness or firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 And it is necessary that when you pull out the arrow, it be weakened in the same way as it was at the moment of the arrow's wounding.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Because it is more helpful (to do so).
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 If it is not possible for you [to perform the operation], then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 An arrow that emerges from the opposite part of another [body], or already proceeds to the outside: or makes a swelling at the tip of the arrow by sensation on the upper part of the skin near it, and you see it protruding: then cut above it, and let the incision be according to the quantity that will be able to grasp tweezers in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then draw it out; for it will become easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 If it is held in the bone, then turn your hand according to its roundness until the arrow presses into the bone and expands itself: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: let it be for some days; then try again until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the shaft of the arrow is in it [the wound], then push it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 If the shaft has fallen out and you wish to give a pushing force: then insert a concave instrument into it so that it enters the concavity of the arrowhead; then push it out with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If the arrow is concave, then push it out with the instrument inserted into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 For the arrow is held by that [thing].
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to excavate all the flesh where the poison is; if it is possible for you [to do so].
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then treat it with that which suits for that purpose.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the arrow falls into the chest, or into the abdomen, or into the bladder, or into the side [of the body] and is close to that which you touch with your hand, and it is possible for you to make an incision above it: then make an incision, and avoid cutting a vein, or a nerve, and remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then look at your wound and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And here is the shape of forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The ends should be like a bird's beak, made of iron; when they grasp an arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And various shapes are made from them, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its smallness or largeness, and the size and narrowness of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The shape of a plunger is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 The shape of a deaf-plunger is spherical.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is the shape of a deaf-plunger like a radius, so that its entrance may be applied to a concave arrowhead and it may be pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The end of the concave plunger is concave like a bird's feather; so that its entrance may be applied to the arrowhead and it may be pushed into it.

Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes it is opened with a wide leech.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, it should not be the one with an acute tip like other leeches, rather it should be broad tipped.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And the leech shall make an incision obliquely, because the bone is near; and perhaps it will break the leech when it is sharp.

The help of Guidi's two phlebotomies is for the constraint of breathlessness, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic ailments, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that are corrosive, i.e., herpes or scabies.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 And the quality of these phlebotomies is to tighten the sick person under each neck with a bandage: and let the craftsman stand over the head of the sick person, and the sick person sit on a chair.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then make the phlebotomy vein slightly larger than the broad phlebotomy.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then draw out a measured quantity of blood, or according to what you see for the necessity that is at hand.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Then do the same with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Then loosen the bandage, and tighten two veins tightly in the middle: so that the sick person does not suffocate.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And release it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 The wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 Chapter on the phlebotomy of veins (by Algeberich).
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 Algeberich's vein phlebotomies are beneficial because they help with intoxication in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those that are in the nose, and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the quality of phlebotomy is that you make the sick person sit before you, and tighten his neck with a bandage.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then roll up his lip, and look at the two veins: one is from the right lip, and the second from the left; and a demonstration of both is by blackening them both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And that is true: because around their course there are small, dark veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Cut therefore both with an incision cutting into them.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If there is doubt over you and you do not know which one they are: then direct your attention to the larger incision of them, and make it clearer.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And likewise do with the two veins that are on the upper lip, and indeed there is a custom with this; and cut the two veins that are on the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 Chapter on Phlebotomy - The Vein Under the Tongue After Cephalic Phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 But of the two veins that are under the tongue, phlebotomy is an aid: because cephalic phlebotomy is for afflictions in the throat and the sickness of the voice, and the sicknesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person sits before you with his head towards the sun: and you loosen his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side, and on the other side a vein; and the color of both descends to blackening.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Cut therefore one of them: and be careful not to cut your hand while phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For there are arteries under it, and perhaps blood will flow out from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 Chapter on Three Veins on the Arm.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 But the three veins that are phlebotomized on the arm, their phlebotomy has a custom in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And phlebotomy [is done] according to two modes.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Or piercing with a broad-bladed leech: or applying oil to the decline: or cutting with a sharp-edged knife and it is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus Alnesil [is] what fits for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from these [there are] wide and narrow [species], according to the width and constriction of the veins. The form of the leech is wide, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it fits to open hollow veins, full, projecting, appearing, thick, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this leech [is] of smaller width, and more subtle for thin veins.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 And it fits to phlebotomy of thin veins which contain fine, yellow blood
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 Chapter on Phlebotomy (Basilica).
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 The phlebotomy of the basilica, which is one of these three vein phlebotomies, is beneficial.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it draws blood from the ailments which are under the throat and neck, following the chest and abdomen; and it fits for the leech to phlebotomize it, so that he may be careful, and it is over fear because under it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If therefore he [the leech] misses and adds in the prick of the leech, he will cut that artery, and bleeding will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore it is necessary that [the leech] does not prick it with the leech: rather it should be cutting with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the basilica does not appear by a manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you touch [it], and replace it with another, or look for one of its branches; or seek a rope of the arm in place of it (for the leech).
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 It is evident and cut it with leech Anesil, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If you wish for the leech's application of this same [person], then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the place until you know the location of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark the place with pitch, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a hollow-edged knife by leech Alnesil, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And be careful that the blow does not fall into the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see, as you tighten the ligament, swelling in the place which you marked with pitch, then that swelling is swelling of an artery; avoid it therefore.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood to rise at the leech like urine of a boy, and it is thin, red: then know that it is from the blood of an artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Then therefore hurry, and place your finger on it in a long space, afterwards remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If therefore the blood is cut (many times it is cut), then tighten the arm and let go of it; and beware the weak man from movement of it, and it should be on watchfulness over it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move it for several days until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 If the blood does not flow and overpowers you, and there is no medicine present for you at that moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 Because its extremities contract and blood flows out.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of a fig tree and grind it; take one half of it and tie it over the appropriate place of the vein constriction with a ligament and pepper until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 If blood flows out then it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not [the artery]: then care for him himself with the remembrance of the place from where powder-like substances removing blood flow are removed; and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, due to the small size of the wound, and the possibility of a ligament from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 On Phlebotomy of the Dark Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The phlebotomy of the dark vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, it is composed of a branch of the Basilica, and a branch of the Cephalica, as we said before.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 Moreover, it is fitting for the phlebotomist to know that it [the dark vein] is above a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 Therefore, if the phlebotomist makes an incision and finds a nerve during phlebotomy, there occurs fainting and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it will not be healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 This nerve often appears to touch (or feel).
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 If it is hidden in some people and is subtle and not visible, then you should place the phlebotomy at that point where it can be phlebotomized with the incision of Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 On the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and contributes to eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And in this vein (the cephalic), if you want, it is appropriate to have the phlebotomist anoint with olive oil or myrtle oil when phlebotomizing; for it is safer than all veins, since it is neither beneath an artery nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 It is fitting for you during phlebotomy that you ask the barber only to cut the head of an arm and seek a less painful spot; it does not harm him if it cannot be found with the first strike, but you should repeat over it several times with the phlebotomy.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 Perhaps sometimes a tumor occurs in some men when not bled in the first strike, but it does not harm him that tumor in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 Chapter on the usefulness of phlebotomy and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The quality of phlebotomy and its accompanying circumstances, in whose correction you must think.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 First, you should know that phlebotomy is not administered except for the preservation of health and its continuance, and caution against the onset of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And phlebotomy is to be performed in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely Cephalic, Fusca, and Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And phlebotomy is to be performed at the beginning of spring following a fast, during summer and autumn, and winter after eating, when signs of filling appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 Phlebotomy is to be performed on the first or third day, after three hours have passed since the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 But phlebotomy administered in diseases has no fixed hour; rather, when necessity and suitability call for it, it is performed at night or day, and in every hour, and in any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 Children should not be bled until they reach the age of fourteen.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 A pregnant woman should not be bled except from the fourth month to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Old men who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 If someone wishes to undergo bloodletting for any reason, it is necessary that they clean their intestines before the procedure with a gentle enema, if there is much fecal matter retained within them: so that during bloodletting no putrid waste from the intestines attracts to the veins and harms the main limbs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 The patient should not be bled while suffering from toxicity (satiety of nausea) or drunkenness or inebriety. It is necessary that this be removed from them first.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 A person with dropsy (hydropisis) should not [be bled].
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 Be cautious about bloodletting again after an attack of the colon, vomiting, diarrhea, increase in sexual activity, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and any other thing that weakens the body or animal strength.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider the subtlety of humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medications: if it is possible for him to do this.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then let a bath be entered, if it does not forbid something else: or exercise with some exercise to make the blood subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And let the bloodletting of his be on his chest around the third day, as we said before: and strive for his chest to be evacuated that day from all bad conditions of animals such as tightness, anger, fear: and from all bad physical conditions such as labor, punishment, excess, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let him have present things with which the custom of mankind is accustomed to run by way of aromatics, and fragrances, and perfumes, and similar things, insofar as their quantity allows.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the bloodletter sit on a stool higher than the stool for bloodletting: then he shall draw out his arm and rub it twice or thrice with his own hand.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then tie the ligament with a suture, and roll it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the constriction be even, because an uneven constriction, either due to excess in constriction, then it prevents the flow of blood; or due to looseness, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after constriction, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to rub his hands together until the veins swell and become palpable to the touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then the phlebotomist cleans the lancet with a little oil, using an old one specifically.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then place the index finger of the left hand on the same vein in the desired location, slightly pressing to avoid the vein fleeing and the blow being scattered.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Because from the veins you find one like a string fleeing at phlebotomy; and from those which are full of wind, it contracts under the phlebotomist, deceives the phlebotomist, and does not open the vein; and if it opens it, it is constricted. Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then lay down the lancet.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If a vein is opened by one blow, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then do it again with another blow in the same place slightly or above it quickly; if the spot is not pierced through.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If the spot is pierced through or if the weak person faints, then let it go for a day or two; and do not tie the ligament.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Perhaps a hot abscess may attract it (the lancet).
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Do not enter the bathhouse.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then perform phlebotomy again, if it is necessary.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small or the blood flows subtly and you fear that not enough blood will flow out; then perform phlebotomy again in the same opening according to correct procedure, and add a little more in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 Make it quickly before removing the location, for the place to be excised is often in many people during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If you see it (the tumor) already excised, then do not go over it at all, for it does not excuse anything from you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And place something made of oil paste upon it (the wound): because it will soothe the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 It is better in this place than oil itself, and than other olive oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And similarly administer oil paste in every bloodletting where you are prohibiting the flow of blood: and this is made by Tyrian alkarab, and Sagzenea, when it is placed over the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 For the blood becomes refined and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If it happens at the location of bloodletting that a large tumor occurs, which often happens especially to those who are not bloodletters except for that time or when there is only a small opening of the vein, then hurry and place over the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated slightly: and squeeze it for an hour: because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And it is necessary that you do this after the blood comes out of the vein itself when it is complete, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If something remains in the place after days that is black or greenish, it does not harm it: and if you wish, place over it something of aloe or myrrh dissolved; or something from the juice of mint, namely camphor or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 Many times indeed tumors and elevations occur during bloodletting in the Basilica (hospital).
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Place your hand on it (the tumor), then if you find softness under your pressure on it, then that elevation is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 "Therefore, place something on it from what I mentioned.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 "Perhaps blood from the artery will flow out of it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 "But make an ointment for him with that which has styptics (stopping properties), so that the place hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 "Then take care of him with the rest of the treatment until he is cured.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 "And it is necessary to draw blood from every man according to the strength of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 "And what appears as a swelling over the blood (blood clot) in color.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 "For if the blood is black, then let it come out until it turns red; similarly, if you see it thick, let it go until it becomes thin; and similarly, if it is sharp (pointed), let it become blunt until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 "And it is necessary for a person who is full, strong and in need of bloodletting once, to increase the bloodletting by the vein and be a vein-bloodlet; and for one who is weak, it should be on the contrary.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 "And it is necessary to draw it (blood) in the veins and that the opening should be narrow; and what is administered by bloodletting through the vein is better if it is a cross-section rather than a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 "This method of bloodletting is safe from blood flow and nerve injury; it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 "And to one who often comes for bloodletting (phlebotomy), it is necessary to eat a little piece of bread soaked in water and muscatel or a dry biscuit if he is hot; and draw blood from him in three or four veins.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 "And if he has a cold constitution, then before bloodletting let him eat bread soaked in honey-syrup or aromatic honey with spices, or aromatic fragrant syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If it happens that fainting occurs during bloodletting and the cause is excessive bleeding, then one should take meat water and subtle fragrant syrup in drink. And he should use aromatic substances along with alum and wash his chest with it. And he should use the remaining things that we mentioned in the division chapter on fainting due to evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 Whoever wants to let down his arm and release blood during the second phase, it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is due to excessive evacuation, and his strength is weak, to release blood gradually according to the strength's amount over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 However, whoever wants to let down his arm and release blood during the second phase, and his body is weak, then he should do this after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 Whoever wants to attract blood from his body towards the opposite part where it has fallen, it is necessary for him that this be done on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 In whose body there is much blood that has become hot and sharp, causing a fever, it is necessary for the blood to come out once, and a large amount to be drawn: and the opening should be expanded as long as fainting occurs. After you have ensured all conditions of bloodletting, place your hand on the pulse of his arm along the course of the blood, so that death does not occur in place of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 It often happens when the bloodletter is unaware and falls because of negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 And it is not necessary when one wants to let down the arm and release blood during the second phase, if the orifice of the vein has already been closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, to press on it with force and quickly stretch out the curved arm.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 It is very bad, rather let it be, until it is bled again in the second stage.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Remove with sharpness the clotted blood from the vein's opening and place upon it something of salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 And put upon it some turpentine, or alfaroch, or sageweed, and press it gently until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 If it is a vein that has been cut off, then let it be, and do not cover it, until the tumor settles down.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 If necessity demands the resolution of blood in a second stage and there is no excuse, then either lance it at that place or on another vein in the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The band of the arm is bled at the place of Fusa and Basilica, since they are not found and hidden, because it is made up of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the quality of lancing is such that a weak hand should be inserted into warm water until it turns red, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then tie it over it with a bandage of moderate constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then lance it crosswise gradually, not widthwise or lengthwise; and make the opening wide, and make your lancing on the junction of the hands partially.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 If the outflow of blood is forbidden, then dip your hand into warm water and let the blood flow in the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 If it is during summer days, then you are excused from dipping your hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 And indeed a great number of bloodlettings are put in hot water during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And the lancing of this vein is safer than all veins because it is not beneath a pulsating vein nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 Phlebotomy for Saluatella (a specific condition) of the right hand is related to the illnesses of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 The quality of the phlebotomy (procedure) for this (condition) is as follows: you should tie a leech to the hand with a ligament or your own hand, after inserting it into warm water, until the vein becomes inflamed and is felt strongly.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then make a crosswise incision (on the affected area) for the phlebotomy.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you completely cut it (the leech), it will not harm her/him at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 And be careful, do not overdo the procedure of phlebotomy with your hand.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For under (the affected area) are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then immerse your hand again in warm water and let the blood run out in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not repeat it (immersing the hand) in warm water, the blood will clot in the vein opening and prevent the flow of blood.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 Therefore, when you have extracted the required amount of blood, put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not clot quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 Similarly, it is necessary to do this with every tightened branch (blood vessel).
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 But the help for this (condition) comes from the left hand: because it is related to the illnesses of the spleen; and similarly do this in the phlebotomy of the second (hand), as you have done in the first, equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The help for the saphena (vein) phlebotomy is in the illnesses that are located in the lower part of the body, such as menstrual problems, kidney issues, old ulcers on the hips and legs, and similar ones from other illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 And the quality of this (procedure) is as follows: an ill person should insert his foot into warm water, and make friction on top of it until the veins appear; then tie a ligature above the joint of the foot with a thong.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 The location of the vein is near the heel, appearing towards the thumb; and many branches branch out from it on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore, perform the incision on a larger branch of it, or near the heel at its aggregation: for it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If you perform the incision on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 Place your lancet for the incision as if you wish to make the incision obliquely; and let the lancer be called Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If the flow of blood is forbidden, then immerse his foot in warm water; and release the blood to run into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the vein is missed by the lancer on the first attempt, then he should return with the lancer to a slightly higher position; for it is safe, and you need not fear any harm from that, as long as you beware of the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The location of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is near the heel on the side of the forest (or woods).
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 The help for this lancing is, for pain in the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 The quality of the lancing is that it enters an unwell person into the bath and makes haste; and bind the leg from the side of the ankle to above the heel with fine and long plaster, for it does not appear unless because of this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When it appears, then perform the lancing as is possible for you according to your skill; either obliquely or crosswise; and it is better, either to make an incision or to sever it with a cut.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 The location is very well-hidden, and it is extremely concealed within many humans.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you cannot find it (the lesion), and it does not appear at all to the senses: then make an incision into one of its branches, and that which appears on the back of the foot, and turn towards the auricle; and beware of the nerves, and let a quantity of blood flow as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then dissolve the constriction, and place skin over the incision site, and tie it up.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 It heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 On Venotomy (Ventosation) and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 Ventoses are made from horns, iron, and glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And ventotomy is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With incision and bloodletting; the other is ventotomy without incision.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this ventotomy without incision, is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the ventoses that are administered with incision and bloodletting, there are fourteen sites on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 One of them is Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is the last part of the head; Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; ventoses Alhagdahim, and there are two plates of the neck from both sides at the same time; ventoses of the brain, and it is under the lower jaw; ventoses of two spatulas; ventoses of Alachosos above the tail end; ventoses of two bellows, and they are in the middle of both arms; ventoses of two legs; ventoses of two ankles.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And Ventosatio does not draw blood from you from the scattered small veins in the flesh, and because of this, its virtue does not fall out from them, as is the case with that event from phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It is not necessary to administer ventosatio whether with fire or without it for any illness that occurs due to congestion, until the whole body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity compels ventosation due to illness or custom, it is administered at the beginning of every month, at its end, and in the middle of it, as well as at any other time.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 Because there are men whose blood, when it is multiplied, until it needs to be extracted through ventosation, finds in his head a heaviness and swelling.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And from them are those who find congestion and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And from them are those who find itching on their face, forehead, and darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And from them are those who have a scalp spot for their ventosation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And from them is one whose laughter is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And from them is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth; or the tongue is loosened and cleansed the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And from them is one whose sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And from them are those who see blood and redness in their sleep, and the dead, and wounds, and things similar to these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When we see something from these [symptoms], especially if it is during the third week of the month: we then order ventosation to be performed, after two or three hours have passed since that day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The benefit of ventosation for the neck is this: because it relieves the heaviness in the head and what is discharged goes to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 It is necessary that it [the wound] be afterwards, after evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 This indeed is a ventose in place of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 And it shall not be used by one who has a cold temperament, or in which there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 For it causes him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And therefore, it should not be used by old men, and in whose head there are cold diseases.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 But if one is to make constant use of it, forgetfulness will be generated on him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And therefore, you must warn the ventosator to put his hand with the ventose for a while towards the lower parts, fearing the production of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Ventosation or Alkehel, is in place of phlebotomy Fuscous and basilican phlebotomy, and therefore it causes coughing, constriction of breath, panting of the instrument, coughing, filling [the body], and tumescence.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 And it is necessary to force the ventose Alkehel for a short while, since if it is placed lower, it generates weakness of the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 Ventosation Alhagdahim causes accidents of pain in the head, migraines, hemigrainae, perforation, and tooth root pain: it is in place of basilican phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And you must warn the ventosator not to press his hand with scarification, lest he cut an artery and there be a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Ventosation under the chin causes drunkenness in the mouth, corruption of gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth: it stands for another phlebotomy, which are on both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Ventosation of spatulae causes alchafacha, which is caused by lying down and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 Interior partitions' ventosation provides assistance to phlebotomy of three veins, Basilicae, Fuscae, and Cephalicae, because it draws blood from all the small veins that are in the flesh; and these small veins draw blood from larger ones until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 It is necessary to instruct the Ventosator not to proceed too much in scarification, since the area is stripped of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 The ventosa that is applied to the anus provides relief for hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 It is necessary to instruct the Ventosator that the ventosa should be large and made of metal, because the area requires strong suction, and perhaps delicate ventosas may break; and it should be scarified with a deep scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 The ventosae of the legs diminish with an obvious decrease, because they draw blood from the entire body and provide relief from old pains in kidneys, uterus, and bladder; induce menstruation, cause bothrodesis and amenorrhoea; and stand where phlebotomy is performed on two saphena veins and alhorcobenia.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they weaken the body greatly and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 The relief provided by ventosae of alhorcobenia is close to the relief provided by ventosae of both legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the position of the ventosae is to place the ventosa first in a vacant area and to apply moderate suction; and do not prolong the position of the ventosae, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that humors come to the area at an equal rate; and do not stop repeating this and continuing until you see the area redden and swell, and the redness appears as blood; then scarify, and repeat suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then, consider in the arrangement of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For whoever is from soft-fleshed people, with few pores, it is necessary to scarify him only once, not more: so that the place does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And command the Leech (physician) to enlarge the scarification and not to dig deeply; and moderate the suction in ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is thickening in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 In the first vein (artery or vein), an opening is made for the subtlety of the blood and its wateriness; and in the second scrutiny (inspection) of the thick blood, the extraction of the coagulated blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If the blood is extremely foul, then let there be a scarification for the third time: to follow the last (option).
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And finally, when we wish to extract blood slowly or in small amounts, it is sufficient for us with one scarification.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we wish to make the extraction of blood many times, we will scarify with multiple scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to be scarified with a deep scarification: and the end equal in the scarification, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 § What is that which must be administered from oils in the position of the Leech (physician), and what must the Leech be careful of when sucking blood?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In the one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary to anoint the places of the Leech with open, soft, resolving oils: if it is in summer (season), such as alkali oil, or volatile oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from the seed of a cucumber.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is in winter time, then use oil of narcissus, or oil from lilies, or oil of chamomile, or sarsparilla: and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 And if excess is large and cold, then use oil of amaracis, or oil from balsamitum, or oil of alben, or oil of anethum: and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 And if it is a large and tender wound, then it should be prevented from oil, and it should be washed with rose water, or cold water, or sea water, or water of cucumber, or water of purslane: and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 For him whose blood has much moisture, wash the wounds with vinegar, or water of myrtle, and sumac: and similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 For him whose excesses are large, wash the wounds with old wine, or water of sassafras, or a decoction of anethum, or chamomile: and similar ones.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 And it should be cautioned against wounding in the bath or near the bath, rather it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And one should not sleep after being wounded.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 What is it that must be regulated before wounding or bleeding?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And after that, you should consider first: then if the wounding or bleeding person is choleric and the sharpness and inflammation prevail over his blood, then it is necessary that he receives cooling, such as musk-grape: also honey with vinegar and lettuce, and sour milk, and cucumber juice, and yogurt: and similar ones.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 And place his food for the chicks, and cook the mutton meat, and prepared foods with herbs: and similar things to it.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 If its complexion is cold, he should take syrup from honey or almiua or alsecaniabin made from seeds in his drink; and he should take medium-aged wine that is between old and new; and it is prescribed that he use sparingly food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 And put his food for the chicks, and roast it; and sparrows, that is, small birds; and he should peel the young pigeons.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 It is necessary that the drink on the day of venesis and phlebotomy be more than the food; and it is necessary that in some people, during the hours of tyriaca alfaroch or medicine from musk, that is muscata, or alesselithe be given before venesis; and before or after phlebotomy, so that the main limbs are strengthened and the blood becomes more subtle.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 And it is not necessary to drink it in heated drinks.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Chapter on Venesis without Scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 Venesis without scarification are those that are placed on the liver, spleen, podagra, and on the abdomen, umbilicus, flanks, and achilles tendon; because these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 And it is not sought through these except for the attraction of blood from one member to another; such as placing a venesis on the breasts in sickness of nasal bleeding.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to dissolve cold and unpleasant congestion of blood in a member; such as placing a venesis on the abdomen and umbilicus.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For it makes the member thin, warms it, and removes pain because it dissolves that congestion.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 Also, it is placed on the kidneys when there occurs an ulceration or stone in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 By virtue of its attracting power, perhaps it opens an ulceration or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 Similarly, when placed on the liver and spleen for the purpose of reducing swelling in both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 These swellings are treated with emptying by incision alone.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes they are treated with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes they are filled with warm water for the diseases of pleurisy: and this is done to fill the swelling and make it large, with warm water alone, or with water in which herbs suitable for the occasion have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 § Form of a swelling treated with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 The width of its opening should be two fingers apart, as we have defined: and the depth of it should be half a palm: and on the side of it, in the place that is about halfway along its length, there shall be a small hole, according to the size required for an awl to enter it: let it be made of brass or citrine, or lead sheets, equal in thickness, smoothed: so as not to injure the limb when placed on it: and let there be a cross bar transverse across it from brass or iron where the candle with the fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now this swelling becomes large, larger than we have said, but smaller than that, according to the diseases and age of the person using it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 Swellings in children and weak individuals are different from swellings in adult males and those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of placing this swelling with fire on a limb is to light a linen cloth or small candle made from tallow and place it over the middle cross bar that is in the center of the swelling: so that the fire is ignited about the lower part of the swelling, so as not to burn the body of the weak individual.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then place on the limb, and let a finger be over the hole I mentioned, until when we grasp the bladder; as needed, remove the finger, and the bladder will come out through that hole, and the bladder will immediately burst open.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then apply linen cloth according to its manner, and repeat it if necessary.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 In the bladder used in pleurisy with water, there is no cross-stick or hole. It is not administered unless it is filled with water and only placed on the limb.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And the bladder is better when it is larger so that it can hold more water.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 Chapter on Suspension of Sanguisugars.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Sanguisugars are not administered in many cases, except where the positioning of bladders is not possible due to their small size, such as lips, gums, and similar areas.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or on denuded limbs, such as fingers, nose, and similar areas.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the quality of their use is: to come from Sanguisugars that are in sweet, clean waters, free of decay.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they should be placed in sweet water both day and night until they are hungry, and there remains nothing in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Then the body is evacuated first with bloodletting, and with bladders.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then cleanse the sick limb until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Then place them on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are filled and drop, and there is a possibility of squeezing the place with a bladder, then it is more beneficial for treatment; and if not, then cleanse the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then with much water, rub and press out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the course of blood persists after a bleeding (of the teeth), and it is oozing: then immerse a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top until the oozing stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If much blood flows out, then sprinkle powdered zegi, or gallnuts and similar substances from styptic plants on top until the blood stops flowing.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or place halved and peeled fava beans on the location: and allow them to remain until the fava beans stick to the location, for blood is stopped by this.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And it is necessary that if repeated bleeding (of the teeth) is required, whenever possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 But if bleeding (of the teeth) is forbidden by suspension, then clean the location with recent blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or fix a probe into the locations until something comes out from the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then place them (probes), for they themselves will immediately adhere when they feel something from the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When you wish that they (the teeth) fall out, sprinkle something from powdered aloes, salt or ashes on them, and they will fall out immediately.

¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 [Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Third Part]
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 [Universal Discourse on the Restoration, Dislocation and Treatment of Twisting and Similar Conditions]
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of a fracture, and dislocation of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know that, o sons, the foolish physicians and ignorant people boast about this chapter on fractures and dislocations, and those who have never read an ancient book nor read anything from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for this reason, that method (of treating fractures and dislocations) is lacking among the learned on our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never encountered anything good in it entirely, and I have not acquired from it that which I have acquired except due to the length of the reading of ancient books, and my zeal for understanding them, until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I adhered through experiment and study over the course of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 I have now described for you everything that my knowledge contains on the subject of this Chapter: and above what my experiment has passed, after I have abridged it for you, and freed it from occupation and length, and abridged it to a conclusion, and showed it to a conclusion: and I have formed many shapes in it from the shapes of instruments which are used therein, since it is a matter of addition, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 Summary and collections of cases of bone fractures, from those of which a prior understanding is necessary before we begin the recollection of the broken members, and of different ones, if of any one in particular.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this Chapter the main points and chapters to which one must be directed first in his understanding for the craftsman concerning their truth: namely, so that you and those who are quick may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 Therefore, I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twisting or accident occurs to someone, it is necessary first to hasten to bleed him and to loosen him, or both at the same time: unless something prohibits this, such as weakness of strength: or he is a child who has had one of these things, or an elderly person in decline: or it is a time of violent heat, or violent cold extremely.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, onions, and beans; and forbid wine, fat meats, and to be filled with foods and any food that fills veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until he is secure from a hot aposteme and no longer fears the issue of matter to the limb; then let the sick person return to his own regimen first with which his custom was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the fractured bone begins to heal, then it is necessary for the sick person to eat nutritious foods in large amounts, thick, heavy, with viscosity; such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, rice, heads and feet of animals, intestines of sheep, eggs, fresh fish, thick wine and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 With this regimen, the healing of the fracture occurs more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And you should know that fractured bones, when they are in men who are in the first old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be held together and consolidated according to their nature always, due to drying of their limbs; and they consolidate and hold together what are from those bones at the end of softness, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 However, nature connects something similar to gluten around the fractured bone from all sides, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and tightens it until they consolidate with each other, and bind together until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until it does not forbid something from its operations; and for this reason it is necessary that you put the nutriment of the sick person in foods that are thick, viscous, and heavy, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the difference of the members; for a fracture of the limb is different from a fracture of the skull bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly all other members are different one from another; and I come with the reminder of every type of fracture explained in its own chapter distinguished from the others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 The types of fractures differ among themselves as well.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 For a fracture is sometimes curved, except that studs occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes a fracture is along the length of the bone; and there are fractures which are studs (astellae), that is, studs, and additions proceeding, such as in a reed when it is sharpened with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not proceeding; and there is a fracture with wound and rupture in the head; and there is a fracture of a small crack.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And every type has its art or specific tool in the restoration of it, according to which its reminder will come, distinguished in their respective places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from that which the bone fracture is known, its curvature and protuberance appears; and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When therefore no curvature appears in the place, nor a sound to your touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor does it have a great pain; then there is no fracture there, but it may be that there is a curvature or a small crack; therefore, you should not move it with your hand and compression at all; rather, lay medicines upon it, whose reminder comes after that which suits the place; then compress it with a fine ligature.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when a place bows and is divided into two, excepting what happens to it in the form of pus, yet every part is removed from its comparison: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour for its correction, equalizing it before hot suppuration occurs.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 If hot suppuration occurs, then leave it for some days until the pus subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then equalize it according to whatever method is possible with gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that the restoration of this, and its equalization, is easier than the bone, in which pus occurs.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then tie it up according to your recollection of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If in a bone pus occurs, then the extension of this broken member is necessary from two parts, if it be a hand or foot; or with your hand, if the member be small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 Let your position be such that you place the member on an equal location according to its natural shape, until the parts of the broken member are extended; then try with all skill and in whatever way you can to make the additions return to their places, and in the best way possible at their locations: and beware according to your strength, so that pain or injury does not occur due to your operation; and try according to your strength to apply one of two bones together with its companion, according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 It is necessary in that hour for you to attempt and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If you see something different there, correct it and equalize it according to the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And beware of vigorous extension and strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 They often cause a hot abscess or contraction in a limb by their surgery, as we have seen it many times from their surgeries.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then attach [something] after the equalization, and a proper surgical procedure, and a tightening of that limb, and calmness, and peace: and warn the patient regarding it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And make him beware, not to move himself during the hour of his watch, and sleep, at the time of rotation, and agitation, and at the time of hunger, and all movements, in the utmost strength of his power.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And that he beware, so that the position of the limb is not followed by pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 Since when he feels pain or injury in the position of the limb, then it is necessary that he be moved to another position which does not cause pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And beware with him so that his position is equal and straight, so that no tortuosity occurs in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of the tightening of the broken limb is as I have told.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Know that broken limbs are differentiated according to their smallness, their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 Those which are small, such as the arm, finger, spade, and similar things, then it is necessary that there be a soft, fine wrapping of cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 And those which are large, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary that there be a wide, hard wrapping in them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 Since a wide bandage connects a large limb and tightens it from all sides with an equal tightening, so that no spot is entered by it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Then after your evacuation, place the appropriate lining on it from the equalization, in soft wool over the location of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin to roll the ligament over the place of the fracture with three or four rolls, according to what the limb deserves; and tighten your hand slightly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then go to the upper part from the place of the fracture and tighten less than your previous tightening with which you tightened the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then extend yourself with the roll from the place of the fracture a little, and soften the tightening gradually until you take a large amount from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another piece of gauze, and roll it again over the fractured place with rolls.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Then go to the lower part from the fracture with the roll.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And let your operation be in the tightening of the rolling and its softening, according to what we said in the first roll.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the rolls of soft wool or cloth, which equalizes the curvature if there is a curvature in it; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then roll over another piece of gauze.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Then place stars evenly spaced immediately over these rolls, if there is no swelling or hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 If there is swelling or an abscess: then place it on that which sits on the abscess, and remove the swelling; and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then tighten the stars over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 The stars should be made from the middle parts of a wide reed, shaved and skillfully formed; or they should be made of wood from which cribra are made, which are made from pine, yew, palm branches, or calingi; and the size of all the stars should be according to this shape and this same form.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, the star that is placed over the suture should be a little thicker and wider than the other stars; and the length of the star should be according to the size and smallness of the member.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then bind on top of the star with another plaster, according to the first binding's tightness.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then bind well with thread, as we said concerning binding; and it is that your binding over the place of the fracture should be more than the fracture itself; and the farther away from the fracture it becomes, the less the binding should be.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 And it is necessary that the threads are of medium size and fineness, and they are made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the work of foolish men placing their threads from twisted cords of linen, it is a great error; because the binding falls with them beyond quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And again, very thin threads do not agree; for you will not obtain what you desire through the binding with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 It is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth between stars.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If the sick man is harmed by the ends of the stars after binding in healthy places: then put under them from soft wool or carded wool until nothing is harmed from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 When there is a fracture with a wound, and a tear occurs in the skin, I will come with its discussion in the second chapter according to its particularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every broken member should be bound with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 For when the member is large, it is not necessary to put stars on top of it unless after five days or seven or more, according to your safety from the occurrence of a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is the method of plasters which the ancients used to restore them, which are placed on a fracture and a luxation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	¶ The common method of emplaster shortened, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children; because it is from that which heat does not prevail, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is to receive from the flour mill dust, and it is the kernel of wheat that hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the millstone; and you shall make it as it is, except that sieves it with egg white; and place its mixture not too thick, nor too thin.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it [the mixture].
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another method of plastering, for the treatment of a fracture, and dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Prepare almess, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath; and grind all of them with 10 parts of myrrh, and 5 parts each of aloes, and 20 parts of alcohol; then sift them, and mix with water of alcohol, or with egg white if the dressing is warm for the weak.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this plaster [mixture].
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is of good composition, it quickly restores broken bones and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method of plastering, which also treats a fracture and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Prepare mugath, mess, white altheae, all ground with 10 parts of myrrh, and 5 parts each of aloes; Armenian pumice 6 times pulverized, and sifted; and make a paste with water or egg white; and administer them.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Another method of plastering for joints and bones separated from their places; it relieves the pain and splintering of the bone, and fractures.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Wool is to be taken, immersed in vinegar and boiled oil; and placed on the location [of injury].
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 In this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good for the relief of hot abscesses; and it expels pain properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Method of Plaster, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take the leaves of figs from the deaf and the leaves of wild papaver (opium poppy); grind all of them together and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Method of the quick-acting plaster for the restoration of a broken bone, and when you wish to hasten the removal of an abscess residue.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Take equal parts of the roots of marshmallow (althea), chamomile, wild flowers, herb flour; grind all of them and make a paste with wine if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it is heated, then make a paste of it with water of coriander, or with water and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another stronger method for resolving a hard abscess during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Take equal parts of the roots of marshmallow (althea), flax seeds, boxwood, vetch, tansy, chamomile, and wild flowers; grind all of them and make a paste with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 Apply it according to the warmth of the limb, and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 But Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed over a broken limb during its restoration, unless made of pitch, and oil; nothing else; and he said that it should have a consistency between thickness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galenus thought that they should be placed over a broken limb during its restoration, which have the ability to dry heat, such as myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, and similar substances from what we mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 Method of plaster for injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Make a paste by grinding equal parts of barley meal, hare's wool or human hair, goose feathers, madder root (altea), and salt; and make it into an ointment.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The amount of the paste required for binding depends on whether pain persists, there is itching or if the fractured bone moves from its place; in such cases do not dissolve the paste for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If there is severe itching or distressing pain or swelling at the site; then urgently dissolve and remove the paste within an hour and apply a soft cloth or sponge soaked in warm water and wash the area until the itching stops and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then allow the limb to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place on it a piece of wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil; bind it over at night until you are certain that the hot swelling has passed, the limb's inflammation has subsided, and the pain has disappeared.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a thin bind and small ointment; do not tighten with your first binding, but with the fine one until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling and all signs have been completely removed; if you need an ointment and binding, then do as before equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing of what was said happens to the limb, then do not dissolve it unless after three or four or five or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when a month has passed, as the appearance of the limb from dissolution suggests, as we said, until the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh on it is close; add more to the binding than your first binding in its entirety; also increase the amount of weak food, according to the remembrance of its previous state.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 If you see that the place of the fracture is already draining and thinning out more than is necessary, then you will know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Therefore, anoint the fracture with warm oil and water at every place where you soften it, and let this be done for three days, and then loosen the bandage a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 By this operation nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 What the foolish surgeons do instead of restoring a limb fracture, when it is not restored properly according to what is required, and is restored by crooked means, is an error in their operation, and there is great fear. And if it were right, they would have said that in their books, and operated accordingly.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I have not seen anywhere the footprint of such a thing, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 Chapter on making an opening in the head.
Caput III.	 Head III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 Types of fractures are various, and their shapes many; and their causes are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For there is a fracture that occurs from a blow with a sword, and the blow removes bone completely up to the siphac, which is under the bone, as an ax does in wood; hence this type of fracture is called "Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 A sword has cut something of a bone and has split its face, but the incision does not penetrate it to the end; this is called the type of fracture Kalan, that is, Absolute Leuation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And there is a wound from two kinds of fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And from the fracture there is one that is compression or abrasion; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this fracture is also penetrating, which approaches the fabric (panniculus) that is under the bone; or it is on the face of the bone; and there are wounds from these two kinds of fractures, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And from the fracture there is one that is hidden in the bone at the subtlety of hair; and it is a small crack, and because of this it is called this type of fracture Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And there is a fracture caused by falling or striking with a stone and similar things that make the bone layer enter internally and form a hollow place; just like it happens to crucibles of metal when they are struck, and part of them goes into the inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 Most often this occurs in the moist heads of bones such as those of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And all these types of fractures, namely separated fractures, are treated similarly; and I will return when I remember this matter completely at its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 We recognize all these types of fractures by examination on it and investigation of them with probing instruments, as well as removal of the corrupted flesh that is over them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 The type of Capillaris is recognized by this, that it protrudes above the bone and is scraped off and smoothed over it with an iron; for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the conditions of the patient; then if you see among his symptoms something that indicates fear, such as cholera vomiting and extension, loss of intellect, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, eyes discharge, redness of eyes, and similar symptoms in many other dispositions, most likely it will not be cured; but if you see symptoms that do not frighten you and hope for a recovery, then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 If a wounded person comes to you first, and he is wounded during the winter days, then it is necessary that you should study the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all preparations.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 If it is during the summer days, then you should hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone decays due to the fat, and those things happen that I have mentioned.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 If the fracture of the bone has already reached the fat touching the brain, and it is with crumbling and attraction, then it is necessary that you cut the fragmented and smoothed part according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 It is necessary that you shave the head of the wounded person and scrape over the bone as much as possible for you, according to the shape of the wound and what is light on what is weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If it happens to you during the scraping of the bone, a flow of blood or hot abscess occurs, then you should apply what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 It is necessary that you fill the place with soaked rags in wine and rose oil, and make the wound rest until the abscess settles, and be safe from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin in the healing of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 One method is to cut the bone with a scissors sharp blade; and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then administer another scissors, broader than the first one; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then also administer another scissors even wider than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 The second method is that you have a number of scissors of various sizes; some of which are wider than others, and some of them shorter than others; and they should be at the end of their sharpness, and made of iron or hardened; and use them with ease when striking the scissors, so as not to strike the head and harm it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If the bone is hard and tough: then it is necessary that you perforate around its circumference before you administer Incisions, with Terebrirs which are named Terebra not penetrating too deep; and they are not called this unless because they do not pass beyond the limit of the bone's flesh to that which is behind it. This is because the Terebra has a round extremity above what is beneath its head, sharp, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents submerging, and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 It is necessary for you to take a great number of these Terebrirs, each one appropriate to the thickness of the bone, until there is no more bone left for the Terebra; whose sharp extremity's size in length and width should be according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the shape of three kinds of Terebrirs or Trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of perforating the bone's circumference when it is broken, is: that you place the Terebra on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then change the Terebra to another place, and put what is between every hole of that size, or approximately that size.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with Incisors what is between every hole in the bone; and do it more delicately than possible near the edge of weakness, as we said, until you have removed the bone, either with your hand or with some other tools which you have prepared for that, such as tenaliae and delicate forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And it is necessary to be careful with all caution, so that the Terebra or the Incisoria does not touch any part of the syphax.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When you perforate the bone and separate it from the syphax, if it is continuous with that, and you remove it, it is necessary to file and make even the remaining extremity in the bone with a similar Incisoria tool.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 The translation is: "Nevertheless, it should be thin and subtle more than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If anything remains from the small bones and cartilage, then take them with ease, along with what is at hand from your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then, care for the wound afterwards with linen cloths, and the ointments that were mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 Another method of operation is easy and completely far from fear; this is what Galen said, and he praised it greatly; and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 First of all, you must begin to uncover the bone part from the place where the fracture is more violent and clear; continue doing so until you have exposed that part, and then place the rounded end of this oval incisor under it.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 The rounded part does not cut anything; the sharp part of it goes along both its sides to a length as you see; so that the rounded part is connected to the siphac with the face of the sharp part incising the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike the oval incisor with a small hammer from one side until you have cut through the bone with ease, as it is rotated; and be careful that no accident occurs in the incident, which you fear completely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 If the healer were not the most foolish of men, nor ignorant of it, nor sleeping, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the fat in certain places, he would cut it with the rounded end of the incisor and free it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 It is freed without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 If the bone fracture does not penetrate to the fat, and what is cut away from the bone is its face, and roughness and subtle cartilage remain in it; then it is necessary for you to grind down the roughness, and remove the subtle cartilage with finer rasps which you have prepared in various quantities, so that it is possible for you to apply them more conveniently and correctly in every place according to what the operation leads you to, and the broken bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 It is necessary that you administer it according to your own proportion, firstly cutting the bone more broadly with those broader scrapers.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer instrument on it afterwards.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not cease to do this continuously until you reach the point of administering it more thinly and more finely than all the others.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 In each and every small crack or fine break, it is necessary to take care according to that which leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And there is a thing that should not be hidden from any person who applies himself to this art, and it remains on top of what we have written and shown in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 If a piece of tissue is detected and retained when you excavate the bone: then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, dip it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another linen cloth, either doubled or tripled, dip it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first piece: and do this as easily as possible on top of it, so that it does not become heavy with pus.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then administer a broad ligature on top of it: and do not tighten it unless by the amount that holds the wound: and leave it with this care for one day, or two days, until you are secure from the hot inflammation.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then dissolve it and administer afterwards medicines with which excessive dryness is present: such as the roots of the lily, wheat flour, powdered incense, aristolochia and similar substances: and there should be, that you make a powder from these medicines which is sprinkled on the wound like dry ones.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And universally administer all medicine of a nature that cleanses and does not harm.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 And be careful according to your virtue, so that the wound in your treatment is clean: let there not be dirt from ointment in it, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 Let not pus gather on it entirely: because when pus gathers on a brain tissue, it corrupts it and makes it rot, and afterwards evil comes upon the sick one after that: and already this has happened with the skull, when the bone is being cleaned from it, especially when care of it is neglected, a blackness arises on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Therefore, if such sicknesses occur as I said, know that it is certainly dangerous to avoid them.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine that is put on it and it is in the virtue of this medicine to make it black: then one must take a part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and wash with them cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on the skull: afterwards take care of it with suitable remedies for healing until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 Chapter on the restoration of a broken nose.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that a nose is not broken except by the two upper parts of it at once, or one of them: because they are two bones; since below it is cartilaginous, it does not break, and it does not happen to it except through injury, and twisting, and crookedness.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of the two parts of it is broken, then one must insert a small finger into the nose and align the fracture with the little finger and thumb on the outside until the nose returns to its natural shape: and this should be done skillfully, with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And be careful that your treatment does not cause pain to the sick one.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and it is not reached by a finger: then it is necessary that the tip of the radius be made equal, in which there should be a small swelling.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If the fracture is in two parts, then make it similar (to the other); and approach with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the rest of the cauterizer (surgeon), with warmth.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert linen cloth (cotton swab) at the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part; or insert two pieces of linen cloth if the fracture is in two parts: and there should be a bulge in the cloth of such size that it fills the nostril opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some of the ancient restorers said that they should be soaked (dipped) in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 But that does not seem good to me, rather it is necessary that the linen cloth be soaked in egg white, made with miller's flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then release (remove) the linen cloth when the bone has set and the cartilage has hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of linen cloth after it has been covered with soft fabric; and this holds the nose fracture more tightly, and prevents the sick person from being prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary (true).
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you want, do that; if you want, do it with linen cloth.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If the nose happens again while you are cauterizing an abscess with hot cautery, pack the nose with caustic (caustic paste), or with ointment infused in rose oil, or a little bit of opium.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if no hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to pack it with wheat flour and incense powder mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a soft cloth upon it (the wound), and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If however the bones of the nose are broken and fragmented or ground, then it is necessary that you split them apart and extract those with instruments suitable for it.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then (you should) make an incision and care for it with that which coagulates and heals, using appropriate plasters or ointments for it.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If (the wound) should occur between the nose and the wound, then it is necessary that you treat it with linen cloths: and apply a leaden cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Chapter on the restoration of the lower jaw when it is torn apart.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is torn apart and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: examine whether its fracture extends only outside and is not broken into two parts and bent towards the inside: in this case, the diagnosis is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, you should insert your left index finger into the weak jaw: similarly, if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert your right index finger: and push with it the bump of the fracture towards the outside with ease using your other hand from the inner part of the bone correctly, and with it even out the same.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the fracture of the jaw has already been separated into two parts, then it is necessary that you apply traction from both sides, according to rectitude: until possible alignment can be achieved.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 If, however, already occurs the movement or dislocation of the teeth: then tie them with a gold thread, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place a piece of wax over the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place upon it (the wound) a double cloth, and place upon the cloth a large well-made awl or a piece of shoe leather equal in length to the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it above (the wound), according to how the binding is prepared for you, and its application suits it until it does not get destroyed; and command the sick man to rest quietly; and place soft foods as sorbets for his consumption.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 If however you estimate that something is changing in its shape by some means; then rush, and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then straighten what has been changed from it (the wound), and apply a plaster made from flour milled into powder with egg white or with wheat bran, after you have removed the dead flesh; and place upon the plaster a soft woolen cloth.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While that plaster remains attached to it (the wound), and the position of the bone does not change, leave it alone without dissolving it until it heals; or bind a fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 This fracture is often bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If however a hot abscess occurs in the meantime, then administer what I have said many times for its relief until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if the fracture is with a wound, think about it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 If however a piece of bone or cartilage is already separated, then be careful in this; remove those pieces of cartilage with what suits you in the removal of them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If however the opening of the wound is narrowed, then expand it with a leech according to the quantity necessary for you.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you remove the cartilage and nothing remains of it, or if the opening of the wound is wide; and if not, place upon it from plasters that suit for that, and let it heal until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 On the restoration of the Fork (crutch), when it breaks.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 Most often the crutch (fork) breaks from the anterior part near the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Or it breaks and is separated into two, apart from which may occur splintering (splinters): it is easier to restore such a fracture.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or, it occurs so that the splinters are in the bone: it is more difficult to restore such a fracture.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or, it occurs so that there is an open wound along with the fracture.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the operation in this case, when there is no open wound (ulcer), is as follows: Have two assistants present, one of whom holds the splintered crutch (fork) and the other extends the neck to the opposite side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then make an even fracture with your fingers until the shape is correct, so that there should be no projection or depression.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If you require more extension, then it is necessary that you place beneath the sick person's pillow a sphere (ball) made of cloth or wool: its size should be according to your need; and extend and elevate the crutch, and compress the ball with your hand until the fracture is evened out, as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you cannot draw out the end of the crutch to the exterior (outside), because it has reached deep inside: then the sick person should lie on his back on his neck: and place under his shoulder a pillow in size, and press the assistant's arm towards the lower part, until the bone of the crutch that is deep inside is elevated upwards; at which point, straighten the fracture and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If you feel a splinter from the crutch and it moves: then it is necessary to find (locate) it on top of that, and remove the splinter easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If it is retained in the bone, then apply your instruments for cutting with one of the incision instruments you prepared for this purpose, after placing under the Furcula instrument which serves as a lever; and this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a snail shell without a concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And let its width be according to what you need for it from the size of the bone and its part.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 But its length is also as possible for you during the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 It should have two ends, as you see; one end should be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If the wound that you divided when extracting the splinter of bone is wide and warm, then cauterize it with hot iron; then gather two lips of the wound together with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the division is small or there is a fear of warm abscess; then fill the wound with cloths and dressing according to the size of the wound cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If there occurs a warm abscess, then immerse cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 However, the setting or fixation of bone without a wound and without incision is to place plaster made from milled flour with egg white on it.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 Place soft wool over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place a sphere under the tip of it if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take a large blood-letting instrument which is held by the Arabs, whose width should be about one palm or a little more.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place a folded dressing over the wool and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take an awl from fine wood whose width is three fingers and of similar length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then roll her up in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then place the cloth with the star (aster) in the place of alchemilla which falls over the fracture and the place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place alchemilla over the fracture as it is rolled, and roll it on his neck, and under the healthy part of his head (titillico sano) and under the diseased part of his head (titillico infirmo): and bring it over all parts, so that you see that the ligature holds the fracture firmly: and this is what is not hidden from you, and everything, so that the star does not remove the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 And for this reason, it is necessary to observe the diseased part every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 How often is the ligament softened and you see that the star has already been removed? Then correct it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the pillow of the sick person under his back, and place a small feather pillow for his head at night, so that when he lifts his head to sleep, help is brought from the other side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 The fracture of the collarbone should therefore be lifted through the elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or bind the arm to his neck and do not loosen the bandage unless it occurs due to an accidental occurrence from itching or eruption, until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster if you see his face towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add something to the ligature and let it go until it is healed and has coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 The fracture of the collarbone is ligated and strengthened to a large extent for forty days, and sometimes it happens in fewer than this number of people.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 Chapter on the healing of the fracture of the spade.
Caput VII.	 Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 A spade rarely breaks, and it only breaks at its wide end; the edges do not break from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When therefore a place is broken from it and broken in the middle of it, and it is not recognized except by touch, then according to what it is in figure, prepare for its fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And reduce it to its natural form by all means of intellect that is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place on the spot powder of millstone with egg white and soft wool, and put above it a small piece from double cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place on top of it a broad awl from subtle wood according to the quantity of the spatula, or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If however under the awl there is a hollow in any part of the spatula, then fill that hollow with soft wool, until the awl descends evenly.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then bind above it with alum long thread, with appropriate tightness and firmness of the awl, until it is not removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And consider the binding every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever therefore the binding becomes soft, tighten it, and if the awl is moved from its place, let it lie weak on its healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And the spatula is restored in twenty days, or in thirty days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When therefore this number is completed, then loosen the binding: and you shall be secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it is from bones whose fracture is not feared nor their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If however a fragment of bone protrudes and pierces under the skin, then cut through it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do what was said in the fracture of a collarbone from cauterization by hot irons, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 Chapter on the restoration of the chest fracture.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 The chest is sometimes broken in the middle, and it happens rarely.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 The extremities of it are most frequently broken and crushed from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When its middle part, which inclines towards the lower parts, is broken and a violent pain occurs along with difficulty in breathing and coughing; and perhaps it vomits blood, and a hollow appears in the fractured bone, and it does not heal over, the restoration of it is that the sick one lies on his back on his own back: and place between his fingers a poultice.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press his shoulders and bring the ribs together from both sides or flanks with hands: and file in equality of its fracture, according to every possible way it can be achieved and converges, until the figure of the bone returns, according to what is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place on him an embrocation and a plaster, and place above it a splint made of thin wood from willow or boxwood, or similar materials, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then file it on a bandage over the broken bone so that it is not moved: and go with the binding following the roundness to the back several times, and bind it with a suitable stitch.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the binding in every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, bind it: and if necessity arises for its solution at the itch or corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess; then hurry, and solve it, and remove the embrocation, and correct what has happened in the manner of treatment of it.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then bring back the embrocation if you see that it faces [the fracture]: and connect a stitch to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 Chapter on Restoration of Ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 Know that the fracture of ribs does not occur except in large places following the back and from their extremities from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And it does not occur to them [the surgical instrument] abrasion, except because they [the parts being operated on] are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of this [a hidden thing] is not concealed from the sense during examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And its restoration is made in such a way that it aligns the fracture with fingers according to the possible method, until it matches the required shape.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then apply poultices, and bind the broken bone with a splint if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 If the fracture is of the ribs sloping towards the inside: then a painful weakness occurs, and puncturing, just like puncturing for pleurisy; because the bone pierces the pleura, and also it causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood frequently; and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And the ancients have been skillful in this with many devices; and among them are those who say that you should place foods for the sick which generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the stomach becomes inflamed, expands, and pushes the fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 We, however, abhor causing a cause for making a hot abscess unless it occurs.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If it has already occurred, then add it [a hot abscess] to it [the wound].
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them said: Place a poultice on the place, then squeeze it with force, and it is more like reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 Nevertheless, it is feared that a poultice will attract superfluous humors to the place, because of its weakened condition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them said: The place must be covered with wool that has already been soaked in hot oil; and poultices should be placed between the ribs until it is filled; so that the binding is equal when you wrap it around according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the sick one is to be treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If the illness presses severely upon the sick one and he cannot bear it, and we cut or puncture the skin with a lance, fearing for the patient: then it is necessary that we split the place open, and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we shall place upon it an instrument which serves to set the siphac, whose memory has been mentioned before: and we shall make an incision in the bone with ease, and then we shall make an incision in it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we shall bring together two lips of the wound, if it is large with suture: and treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If an abscess hot happens meanwhile, then hurry and pour pulverized sulphur in rose oil, and apply it to the place: and treat the sick one with what is suitable for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 Moreover, it shall be laid upon the side on which he lies until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 Chapter on the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 Fractures of the neck bones sometimes occur and seldom is there rubbing against them; similarly with the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 If this happens to someone and he wishes to know if it will heal or not, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 If you see his hands already softened, stunned, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend nor contract them; and when you compress them with your fingers and pierce them with a needle, he does not feel it, nor feels pain in them: then you will know that it is not healing, and it is mortal in many conditions.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If he moves them and feels compression with fingers and pricking: then you will know that the neckbone is safe, and that the injured one will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If it happens in the spine similar to that, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not: then consider his feet; then if you see that they are softened, and what has happened to them is like what has happened to the hands: furthermore, when he lies on his back, flatulence and discharge occur without his will; and when he lies on his stomach, discharge occurs without his will; and when he wishes to defecate, he cannot: then you will know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore, do not labor in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 If nothing of the kind happens to him, then it is less severe.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And his treatment that happens due to this is, you should apply warm poultice of apotemes: thus, you place on the spine a rubbed oil of rose alone; or with goat's wool soaked.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place on that several times a day, until the warm poultice is calm; then place on one spot from the comforting, drying, and tightening plasters, and bind it with a bandage; and instruct the injured to rest quietly and peacefully.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 He should not sleep on the side where he finds pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it happens during the grinding of a bone (sathaiatum) that something separates out from it, then it is necessary for you to sever it above the skin and remove that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then gather together two lips of the wound (if it is large), with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for (the wound) itself with some flesh (incarnatio), from ointments, until it heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If, however, the last bone of the shin (alhausos) breaks and it is the end of the heel: then it is necessary for you to insert your left thumb into the anus and equalize the broken bone with your right hand, as much as possible, according to the second adjustment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place it (the bone) on top of it and remove it: and care for the wound with the treatment that preceded, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 Chapter on Repairing an Ankle.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Bones of the ankle (Ancha) rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If the bones of the ankle break, then their fracture is not anything but a comminution at their extremities; and they are split lengthwise and bend towards the inside; and it occurs in a weak pain in that place, and puncture; and the leg that breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And the repair of it (the ankle) is to extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture, in its figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the fracture is only at its extremities, then equalize that fracture, according to what you are prepared for by the adjustment, until it becomes similar to its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If the fracture is along its length or already bends towards the inside: then make the weak person lie on his stomach (infirmum super uentrem), until the repair of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you have equalized it (the bone), place an ointment on top of it; then place a splint made of wood or hide on top of it; and tie the bandage over it where you do not fear changing the fracture nor removing the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And make the concavity of those [objects] equal to what fills it, until it is seized by a ligature according to equality; and command the sick person to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If, however, a boil occurs that is hot: then stop extending it and its healing, until the hot boil settles; and place on top of what is sitting, as it was before, then return to its healing; and tie it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If, however, pus occurs in a bone, or it breaks, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 Chapter on the restoration of an ulna fracture (Adiutorium).
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The Adiutorium is that which is between the elbow and the head of the spatula [radius].
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If, therefore, it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One method is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness in the following shape.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And tie two ligaments at each of the ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then lift up from its place, and let the sick person sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then cast his broken arm upon a log, until it reaches the notch of the same log where the fracture of the stick is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then suspend something heavy above him, so that his attendant can stretch him downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the physician sets the fracture with his hands until it comes back together as needed.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 Another method is for the sick person to lie on his neck, and hang his hand from his own collar with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then command two attendants, one of them to hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and let the other hold below him, and each extend himself to his own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 If you wish the extension to be stronger, then tie a ligament under the fracture and another one above it: and let each of the two attendants stretch himself to his own sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If the fracture is near the end of the humerus (upper arm bone), then a ligament should be placed under the notch and another one below the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then a ligament should be placed on that spot and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then set the fracture easily without strain until it is aligned as needed and well positioned: then bind it, if there is no hot abscess.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 If, however, a hot abscess occurs, then release the binding for seven days.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 Place a soft linen cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil on him until the abscess subsides: then bind it; the method of binding is to place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then place the inflammation (or wound) on a new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then bring the arm to the support itself and place one's open hand on one's shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 Place the cloth and bind the arm to the support so that the arm remains in place like a star: if nothing prevents you from it or anything changes due to the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If you are afraid that something may change due to the broken bone, then use a star (treadle): and there is one to place over the fracture which is wider and stronger than the others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 Place the width of each star equal to a finger: and the length of the stars should be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from all sides.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then bind over the stars with a bandage as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it should be that your bandage is tighter around the fracture site.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And as much as the fracture extends, the bandage becomes looser.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If you see the position of the stars and bandage as we have said, at the time when you are restoring the limb immediately, then do it: and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave off the bandage and the stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the ligament for three days so that itchiness, swelling or food does not reach the limb because of the excessive tightness of the bandage.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Therefore, correct this entire matter as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If you are confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not loosen the ligament unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 The sick person should sleep on his back and place his hand on his stomach: and put woolen felt under the support equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 Consider at every hour of the night or day, that the figure of a broken member is not loosened, nor does the ligament become softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Correct it therefore entirely by your power.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 Place food for the sick according to the order that we have given, so that it is a subtle food first, until the bone begins to tighten; then it is necessary that you increase the amount of his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For the custom of assistance and of the leg is that it should be tightened for forty days; then therefore it is necessary that it should be loosened, and a bath should be administered, and it should be treated with ointments which correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the fracture is foul, scrape it; then do not loosen the ligament and remove the pins until fifty days have passed, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Chapter on the restoration of an arm fracture.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is made up of two bones, which are called the two ulnae.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One of them is small; and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other is large, and it is that which is placed below the smaller one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore, perhaps only the larger ulna breaks, or perhaps both break at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 When the smaller ulna above is broken, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the lower ulna is broken, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And it is worse if both bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If the bone that breaks is the smaller ulna above, then it is suitable for the doctor at its restoration that he put on a slighter extension with ease, until it equals itself.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 But if the larger ulna is broken, then it is necessary that he put a strong traction very much.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 It is necessary that the figure of the hand be placed near its restoration, and its extended extension over the pulley.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 The thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers: and the inferior joint of all the fingers, or the rest, should be lower: and if the weak one is sitting, he should be square on himself, and the pulley should be before him, or directly in front of him, at a height so that the weak one does not labor too much.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then let the assistant extend the arm from its lower part, with his hand, or with a ligament.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another assistant shall extend likewise above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the physician equalizes the bone until he reduces it to the best possible shape.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are spicules in the bone fracture, then try to reduce all the fragments into their places with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 If it appears that there is a separate piece of cartilage separated and piercing the skin, and you have no hope of restoring it: then puncture it and remove it according to the method we mentioned earlier.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already written a separate chapter on this, so take care of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then soak a cloth with wax made from rose oil, white beeswax, and have it be of medium thickness between thick and fine: and tie the cloth over it with a thin thread until when the abscess settles: then remove the wax, and apply the prepared plaster made from milled flour with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place the screws, and let the one placed over the fracture be a little wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of screws for the arm is six in multiple positions: whether the fracture is in one splint or two splints at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place your ligature over the stronger and more forceful part of the fracture, and a little further with the ligature towards the upper or lower parts of it; or place a softer ligature on its side, according to what was previously remembered in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And let the bandages that are wrapped around the fracture be soft, damp, and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 And let the thread used to tie be of moderate thickness between delicate and coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 Consider the limb and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something happens which requires rectification such as itching in the limb, then it is necessary that you warm the member with embrocates and hot water until the itch subsides, and leave the member unbound until it subsides, then repeat the binding.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 If the ligature has already been softened and the bone removed, and similar things have happened, then correct it all with your power, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to the excessive binding, then it is necessary to soften it a little and leave it for some days until it reaches nourishment again, then bind it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 But if none of the things we mentioned happen to the weak, then it is not necessary to loosen it unless after twenty days or about that.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then suspend the weak hand to its neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 Let his neck be straight and keep it in place with your power against excessive movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 Make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 Know that this fracture heals in thirty days or in thirty-two days; it may heal in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 All of this is according to the dispositions of the temperaments and the dispositions of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 On the restoration of hand fractures.
Caput XIIII.	 Title (Caput) for the chapter. The original Arabic title
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that the fracture of the hand and the fingers seldom occurs with scissors or ligatures.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 It does not happen to him except by repeated rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When the fracture of the foot occurs, either by blunt force or repeated rubbing: then it is necessary that the sick person be seated in a square position and that a seat be placed opposite him at an equal distance.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand on it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then the assistant should spread out the broken bones and the physician should align them until they join well with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary to place an ointment and a plaster if no hot abscess occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place a splint on top according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If the fracture is in the lower part of the foot around the heel, then make a similar sphere from cloth and command the sick person to bend his foot on it with the broken part facing upwards. Then tie it with a long strip of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the splint be made of soft leather and apply it to the skin of the foot. Tie it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary to place a splint on top and another underneath the foot. Keep the hand open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then tie a bandage around as if closing the hand and extend it between the fingers with a ligature.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If a fracture occurs in any of the fingers, if it is the thumb, align it as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then tie it with the palm of the hand and if there are any swelling, place a straight splint under it to lift the fracture and keep it still.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If the fracture is in the middle finger, ring finger, little finger or thumb, then align it and tie it with the neighboring healthy finger that follows it; or all of them together following the continuity; and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Place a small peg over it [the wound], as we said on the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And when making your restoration and after the proper arrangement of the suture, place hot application on it [the wound]: apply as required whenever something happens from that part, according to its recurring account.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 Chapter on the restoration of a fracture of the hip (Hip Fracture).
Caput XV.	 Chapter Fifteen.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The thighbone (Femur) is broken often and made apparent to the sensation, because it turns towards the inner and posterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its restoration is done by tightening a ligament above the fracture and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 The patient lies with his face downward (prone position).
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then, let every ligament be extended to its own part equally: and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone. If the fracture is on one side or the other, then extend the ligaments as necessary on that side.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 If the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let the ligament be towards the neck part, so that the extension falls upward: and let another ligament be below the fracture. If the fracture is in a limb or extremity, then place the ligaments accordingly for the proper support and alignment.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, then let the ligament be towards the knee so that the extension falls downward. If the fracture is in an arm or other extremity, place the ligaments accordingly for the proper support and alignment.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the physician adjusts the bone with both hands until it is returned to its natural shape: and let the bone be united by a good union (healing).
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then it is necessary that you place a plaster and a binding if there is no abscess in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If an abscess occurs there: then leave it for some days until the abscess settles and becomes warm; then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 The binding should be in this way (as described before).
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is necessary that you wrap a hard egg over the fracture, that is, bind it: and double it twice, or thrice: and there remains an excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wrap the leg until you reach the calcaneus at its root.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee and come to the lower parts: and the ends of the thread should come from the upper side of both parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then roll over the leg and the hip what remains from the other.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place stars on the hip in the location of the fracture itself: and place one star on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill the voids between the leg and the hip with soft cloths so that it is equal to a binding.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then begin with a strong binding from the middle over the location of the fracture with three or four windings.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you extend more with the ligament from the location of the fracture, let your binding be smaller, softer, and looser.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then pay attention to both ends of the thread which you inserted between the hip and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Tie three stars with both ends.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go with both ends of the thread to the lower parts until you reach the ankle.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And tie also the ends of the stars with both hands so that the ligament is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then leave the binding on for as long as it remains, so that it does not happen to the member that it rots, or abscesses, or swells, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 What if something happens from there.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Therefore, when you solve it, correct what happened there entirely, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If however there is a piece of bone from the broken bone that protrudes: then it is necessary to equalize it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 If not, find on it and remove it; and take care of the one who followed, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 When this hip fracture is tightened, even if bolts are added as we said in the assistance and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, in the restoration of such a broken one, lame-walking does not happen to the weak.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 If it is restored alone, except that another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary for the one who has it, to always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 Know that the hip is tightened within 50 days or less, or more, or too little is added, or too little is removed; all of this is according to the diversity of temperaments and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 [Section] On the restoration of a knee-cap fracture.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that the knee-cap rarely breaks, but is frequently worn down.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 But if it does break, then only a crack or hole in its parts occurs.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 And this is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 It stands on the whole with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 The restoration of this is as follows: it is made equal to what was broken from its parts with fingers until it is gathered and joined together as possible through matching, convenience, and craftsmanship.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then apply a plaster made of wheat flour or milled flour with egg white; and place on top a round bolt, if necessary; then tighten it above the wound suitable to that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the dispositions that we have mentioned in other fractures; such as hot abscess and similar to this; so that you oppose every incident with what suits it until healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 [Section] On the restoration of a leg fracture.
Caput XVII.	 Title XVII. (Title in Latin)
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 You should know that the leg is composed of two bones, one of which is large and it is called the Leg; and the other is slender, and it is called the Shinbone.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 It happens to both [the leg bones] that fractures occur as they do in the two bones of the arm; and because of this, their restoration is equal and the operation is one. (It refers to the same process for treating fractures in both leg bones as in the two bones of the arm.)
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If both bones [of the leg] are broken at once, then the leg is deformed in all directions. (If both leg bones break simultaneously, the leg becomes deformed in all directions.)
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 If the slender bone [of the leg] is broken, then the leg is bent towards the front part. (If the shinbone breaks, the leg bends towards the front part.)
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 If the large bone [of the leg] is broken, you will find it below; and they are of those which do not escape your notice. (If the larger leg bone breaks, it can be found lower down and is not hard to locate.)
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then administer stretching, equalizing, and ligature of the star-like joints equally. (Stretch, align and securely tie the joints in an equal manner.)
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 However, if the fracture of the leg is a foul one having many seathagies (small splinters), then it should be stretched less and the reduction [of the bones] should be made more gently. (If the fracture in the leg has many small splinters, stretching should be done less forcefully and the reduction process should be carried out more gently.)
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 And in the leg there is something similar to an arm operation; and it is when you equalize the joints, and complete your whole procedure, then take two strips of pine wood which are used in the construction of solariums placed beneath tables; and they are made from the flat part of the palm; and choose those which have a small thickness and are not too thin; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down to the foot. (In the procedure for treating the leg, there is something similar to what is done in the arm operation, namely when you align the joints and complete the entire procedure, then take two strips made from the flat part of a palm leaf from pine wood used in the construction of solariums beneath tables; choose those that are not too thick or thin, and their length should be equivalent to the length of the leg from the knee down to the foot.)
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then cover each piece of cloth with two foldings along its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 Place one part from one side and the other part from the other side. They should extend from the knee down to the lower part of the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then tie two bands at three places, namely from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 As ligature is forbidden, the leg becomes weak and falls to the right or left side, maintaining a good position (or posture).
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And now the crib is made of wood according to the length of the leg and it shall be placed under the leg to keep it still.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 It is very important that you do this when there is a fracture and the wound is in its correct place.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then consider the leg every day and treat it with utmost care from swelling, inflammation, or any other problems.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If anything of those (problems) happens, then apply the remedy as needed until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the fracture of the bones in the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 The calcaneus bone rarely gets a complete fracture.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 The bones of the foot sometimes get a fracture and it rarely happens to the fingers; they do not get fractured unless there is severe trauma in multiple positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If a fracture of the bones in the foot occurs and you see the bone rise above itself, then lay the weak foot on a prepared ground as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand still and place your foot on the elevated part made by those bones; then press or step on it. Press it evenly, until it returns to its original position.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then apply a poultice and linen cloth over it; place a small board under the arch of the foot with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then bind it with a suitable ligature after you have opened it with linen cloths, and with whatever else is needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 When three or four days pass, then loosen the ligature.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find the bones equal if they are broken or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 Therefore, the operation is as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If any fingers are broken, then restore them, and align them as I told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place the awl on your finger according to the length of the finger, and let it be slightly wider than that; then place the board beneath the foot as I told you, and bind it with a suitable ligature.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If what is broken consists of two, or three, or more bones, then place the awl above each finger according to its size, rolled in linen cloth; and bind the board beneath the foot; and let it stand on one side of the lower part of the foot outside the body, so that it holds well by retaining.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 It is good that you remember not to forget all that I told you concerning the other fractures which I mentioned; and apply each case with what is required for it.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 Chapter on the female neck wound, and the clavicle, and the penis bone of a man.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When the woman's neck is broken, then make her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then incline her to the back of the same slightly, and hold her from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then let the midwife fill the womb of hers with cloth, until it is filled: and let there be in the womb from that as a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then strike the woman, and slowly raise her back up.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For that cloth goes out until it is before the door of the womb as a sphere, and the broken bone comes back.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place the child on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 Whenever she wants to mix, let her easily remove the cloth, then let her mix: and bring it back according to the manner by which you first inserted it: then return to her own child first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Let that be done for seven days, or approximately, because the bone itself heals.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you want, take the bladder of an egg, and tie a reed cannula on its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her womb.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow through the cannula with force, until the bladder inflates inside the womb, because the fracture comes back.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then let it be filled with cloth, and stay for some days, as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when the bone of the cheek of man or woman is broken, then administer for its healing, and the same remedy as we have said in the bone of Ancha.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And do not hide the right side in those near fractures, which occur little, especially if there is something of study or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 And understand my book much, because the fracture itself indicates to you in many dispositions the way of healing for yourself and the tightening of yourself: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 In the rod (phallus) of a man when it is broken, take the neck of a goose: and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place on top of him a covering from cloth, and wrap it, and let it be for three days, or approximately those, and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 On the restoration of a bone fracture when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is appropriate for him to whom happens a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone or shoulder blade or similar, to run and summon the phlebotomist immediately; if they confirm to you the conditions of phlebotomy, as we have mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound bleeds blood, then it is necessary that you run to its amputation, thus pouring powder on top of it which has been ground; if there is no one else present to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin the restoration of the fracture on that same day; and do not delay it, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 But if an abscess hot occurs, then postpone the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach him on the third or fourth day, for you would cause harm to occur to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 If the broken bone is protruding through the skin, then it is necessary to attempt to reduce it, and equalize it with your hands with ease and minimal extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 If the extension is not prepared for it, and its equalization with your hands; then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is the size of seven or eight fingers; and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And therefore it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four according to the size that he needs for this in every kind of treatment of fractures.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And let it be round; and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it does not double during the pressure applied to it during the hour of the operation; and let it have sharp edges, with a margin on its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And let the top part of it be as thick as the middle of it down to the bottom.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 It is necessary in this operation that its end should be placed sharp and rounded above the projecting bone's edge; and push it with a single blow, until the bone returns and becomes even with some approximation.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Try to equalize the ends of the fracture on both sides.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the fracture's end is subtle and does not take the tool well, then it is necessary to cut that bone's edge until the tool has control over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 But if you cannot reduce them with it as we said, then cut that bone with the chisels we mentioned or saw through it with a single saw in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then scrape off what remains in the bone from roughness and small surfaces.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 When the bone is reduced and finds a weak spot after its reduction causing violent pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	 Make it (the incision) thus.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For you confer great help on the weak when you complete the restoration that you do for the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then immerse a cloth in stinking wine, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And properly so if it is summer (or in a hot season).
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place above the wound any linen or anything that contains oil; to prevent rotting and corruption in it (the wound).
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer asterisks at the time of completion of your bone restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And let the detected wound heal; thus, cut with forceps the hole in the inflammations according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 And be careful not to compress the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For often foolish doctors have done this; and they have caused death upon the weak or rotting, or ulcers (gangrene), that is, purulent discharge.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And let your ligature be soft, gentle, and diverse from other ligatures for fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or large and you fear certain unfavorable events as we have mentioned, and find pain suspended at its place: then it is not proper to apply stars (bandages) on top of it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make them infiltrations from strong cloth at the place of the stars (bandages), and tie it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 When after one or two days you see the wound begin to produce pus: then remove from above it the cloth which you placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then apply linen cloth and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds; such as tetrapharmacon (four-ingredient ointment) and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it is fitting for you to loosen the ligature.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 Consider the wound every day at morning and evening, until it becomes solid and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 It is necessary to prepare the limb so that pus runs from it easily towards the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If many days pass and the wound does not become solid nor the pus is expelled from it: then you will know that there are small bone pieces in that place.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, you should examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 How many of those small bone pieces are separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those which are not separated and penetrate the limb, and cause pain, try to cut them and remove them in any way possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If a blister or abscess, that is, an ulcer or other corruption and putrefaction occurs at the wound: then it is necessary to oppose each one of them with what is appropriate for its treatment, as has been mentioned in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And concerning the matter where my speech should stand, and to whom you must present your mind when a bone breaks, and protrudes over a limb, such as the hip bone or elbow, and similar large bones, it is that you should not presume its attraction, for often death occurs from it. Indeed, leave it alone until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps it will fall by itself within twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Then care for the wound if it seems to you: and if not, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a knot in the wound from a fracture.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 Often this knot occurs in the healing process of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Primarily those that are near the joints: it becomes foul from such a shape of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it prevents the limb from its own natural operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Therefore, if the knot is recent, administer medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, gum tragacanth, acacia and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Thus, to receive some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, egg white, vinegar, and apply them on the knot with a plaster, and secure it well with a good stitch.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And release the stitch, do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then unloosen it, and tie another one until the knot is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or secure it with a lead plate tightly.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the knot has already turned to stone and is tightly bound and urgently demands removal, then bind over it from the upper part of it, and cut off the excessive protrusion: or grind it with certain rasps until it is removed: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 Regarding treatment when a member is restored and remains subtle after that, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	 In hoc capite depingitur quomodo curari
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When a bone fracture is restored and remains subtle and weak, it is not done except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 One of the reasons is excessive dissection of the ligament and its ligation not as required: or because of the excess of tightening of the ligaments, preventing nutrition to reach the member: or because of an excessive amount of unnecessary embrocation at the wrong time: or because of a lack of blood in the sick person's body and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 The treatment for this is to feed the sick person and make his body soft, until blood multiplies in him.
Et administra balneum.	 And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 And pour joy and happiness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place pitch on the member: to draw the pitch to itself a great amount of nutrition.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 And continuously anoint it with embrocation and warm water, until the nutrition returns, and it regains its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 Regarding treatment when bone fractures are restored twisted.
Caput XXIII.	 In hoc capite depingitur quomodo curari
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 When a member that has already been restored after healing becomes twisted or the bone protrudes, or knots, and it deforms the shape of the member: yet the member is not prevented from its natural function: then it is not appropriate to listen to the opinion of one who thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who did this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 This operation is indeed blameworthy very much, leading to death or a great fear that it may be fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 But if the limping and knots are recent: then it is necessary to anoint with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as the leaves of the elderberry tree and its root, and marshmallow, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And let there be made an ointment like the softening plaster, as skillfully prepared as dyachilon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Take the mucilage from the root of the marshmallow plant, grind it with chicken fat or sesame oil; apply it as an ointment.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Take figs, pound them with pigeon droppings and similar substances that are known for reducing hardening [or consolidation].
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And at times a knot is loosened with persistent, ancient, and gentle friction, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 Move the affected limb to all parts in every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If a twist has already occurred and become strong and turned into a stone, and the need for treatment with iron has arisen: then it is necessary that it be cut above, the continuation of the bone be loosened, and what is superfluous from the knot or the bone is cut with sharp incision instruments: and ease should be administered to it with diligence and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 Chapter on Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the displacement of any joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Why it should be kept still and become swollen in shape.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And causes severe pains to occur on the sick person and violent injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 When there is a dislocation, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration; one should not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if it is delayed, the location will be lost and possibly the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore, it should not be moved or extended during the hour of its location.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Because it often causes spasms and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 However, when this happens, then one must hasten to the bloodletting of the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then let it be released, until the abscess subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then the member is to be anointed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then it shall be reduced gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And all members shall be treated by him whose memory comes to the place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I have already arranged chapters on dislocations, even as it was in fractures from the top of the body down to the lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 Chapter on the care of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 The two Jaws scarcely dislocate seldomly.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 The dislocation [of the jaw] occurs according to two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 Either they are moved away from their places by slight removal and made smooth somewhat.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Or they are dislocated with complete dislocation until they become smooth to the chest, until the saliva of the weak runs out and it cannot hold it, nor can it close its mouth, and the tongue is wrapped with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When the dislocation [of the jaw] is slight, then it returns by itself in many positions with little difficulty.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If the dislocation [of the jaw] is complete and integral, then it must be quickly reduced and not delayed excessively; and there should be someone to hold the head of the weak person; and the doctor should insert his thumb into the root of the dislocated jaw on one side if the dislocation is from that side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or insert both thumbs at once if the dislocation [of the jaw] is on both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, which he holds evenly.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And command the weak person to clean his jaws and purify them for eating in every part.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 The doctor holds the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the reduction [of the jaw] is difficult, especially if both jaws are at once: then administer steam with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy; do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we said before.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When they return and are evened out, and the mouth of the weak person is closed and they are not made smooth: then place them on top of them fluffy wool pieces from a cloth; and with rose oil and beeswax.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it is tied easily with soft sutures.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And let the sick man's sleep be on his back: and let his head stand between two cushions, so that he does not move it to right and left: nor let him try or be forced to chew something: instead, let his food be soft, until when the pains are removed, and his jaw is bandaged: then, let him eat what he wants, and let it be given to him easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 Let him not work on his mouth's surgery during eating and drinking, and speaking, until his jaw is bandaged and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places: then, many times fevers and constant sores occur; and perhaps the sick man's stomach dissolves, and perhaps he vomits pure choler.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 When therefore you see that: then you know, that it is a loss, and many times he who has this happens to him dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Chapter on the reduction of dislocation of the collarbone, and the extremity of the shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The collarbone is not dislocated from the inside side because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 And it is dislocated at times to the outside, and this can be felt.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 And the restoration of it is that the sick one lies on his back, and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then the wound is closed with your fist, as it returns to its place.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then lay an ointment on it and powder, and press it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 But the extremities that follow the elbow should not be separated from it, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is dislocated on some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and made equal according to what I have said, and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then lay an ointment on it and powder, and bind it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And command the sick one to adhere to calmness and rest until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And with this same treatment, the arm extremity is reduced when it is separated from its place as well.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 Chapter on the Reduction of Dislocation of the Shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One of these is that it dislocates to the part of the armpit towards the lower side.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second is that it dislocates to the chest area.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it may dislocate to the upper part of the shoulder: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 It is not dislocated behind, because of the spine.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 It is not dislocated in front, because of nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 And indeed it most frequently dislocates and goes towards the lower side turned into the armpit; especially in those who have less flesh.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Because it goes out quickly in them, and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 In those whose flesh is numerous, there is, on the contrary, that which goes out with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps it happens to some people a blow or fall, and the shoulder is dislocated and it is thought because of this that it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, one should experiment that, until you are certain of its condition, and then proceed in the treatment of it.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 A dislocation is known when it is turned towards the lower part and towards the tip of the little finger: and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you find among them a manifest difference, and you find in the head of the shoulder a hollow, and below the tip of the little finger, when touched, the head of the shoulder seems to be an egg: and a weak person cannot bring his hand to his ear nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upward: then you find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 The reduction of this kind of dislocation is easy when it is recent, or if the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 And the reduction of it is that you lift the hand of the assistant to a higher place.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then put your thumbs below its tip, and lift the joint with strength to a higher place to its own place: and the assistant lifts his hand, and extends it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then he puts it downward, for indeed he quickly returns.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 But if it does not return through what has been said, and from the beginning when the dislocation happened there are many days: then it is necessary that the weak person be bathed in warm water, and a poultice administered which softens and soothes, as if they decoct roots of althea, and fenugreek, and melilotus in water, and it is administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 The sick man lies on his back: and let there be placed beneath his navel a sphere and wool which is equal between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 The physician places his heel upon the sphere, and raises the head of the arm with force, and draws the hand of the sick to below.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 Another servant holds the head of the sick man, so that it is not moved downwards; for he immediately returns.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish, do this in this way: and it is that the present man who is taller than the sick man should stand on the side, and insert his arm under the navel of the sick man; and raise the navel upwards, until the sick man is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 Another servant pulls the hand of the sick man to below his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the sick man is lightweight: then it is necessary that he is suspended with something else, in order to weigh him down; for dislocation immediately returns.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And it can also be done in another way: and it is that a long piece of wood is placed on the ground, whose head is round shaped like a mortar handle; but not too large or too small.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then place beneath the sick man when the heads of the logs are placed on his head; and the sick man should stand along the length of the log.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then the hand is extended to below from the other side, and the body is extended from the other side with force; for dislocation returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If the reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this care: and it is to take a log whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers; and round head, so that it can be inserted deeply into the opening of the navel, in this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then, cover the round head with soft cloths, so as not to hurt the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Place it under the sensitive area of the weak, so that the hand or arm can be extended over the wood to its lower parts. Then tie the wood and the arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then place the arm over the step on the ladder, and extend the hand to its lower parts, and let the rest of the body hang suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 The joint then enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 When the entry is completed as much as possible, then it is necessary to place a ball of equal size made from wool under the sensitive area.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then apply a plaster prepared from milled flour with beeswax and egg white over the whole shoulder as it is customarily done.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then bind under the sensitive area a suitable bandage. Roll the bandage over the plaster above it. Connect the hand to the neck of the same person and let it not move for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 It is necessary to place a sparse food until the limb recovers strength; for it heals more quickly in this way.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then, after seven or five days, stretch it out and let it be washed with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If it becomes hard and is not softened, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If the joint is dislocated frequently due to moisture that occurs there or due to some other cause, then it is necessary to administer a cautery with three holes as mentioned in the chapter on cauteries.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If this is done completely and the bandage is loosened after seven days, and the joint does not become firm, and the plaster and bandage are applied to it several times without becoming hard, and it falls and cannot be raised to a higher position: then you know that the nerves that go to the head of the shoulder have been cut or stretched or softened. And you know that the joint will never heal in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 Dislocation which occurs towards the breast and nipple, or reduction to the rear, is made by pushing and extending with hands until it returns; then, additional compression and care should be administered until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If there is heaviness in the limb after healing and sluggishness of motion, then the afflicted should use baths many times until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Treatment for shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 Know that the joining of the shoulder is dislocated with difficulty, and it also returns with difficulty; this dislocation occurs in all directions, but especially in front or to the rear.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And the dislocation of this joint is not hidden from you: because it falls under your sight and touch, according to whatever shape it may be dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join a dislocated shoulder with the healthy one, it is made clear to you manifestly.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 Indeed, the joint should be hollowed out, and the arm cannot double, nor can the humerus touch it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 It is necessary to rush and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if a hot abscess occurs, the reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is to the rear.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 Indeed, every kind of dislocation is worse and more painful; and death often accompanies it many times.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the restoration of it when it is one that can be reduced, is to extend the hand with two hands; and the arm should be stretched out, and the physician's hands should be above and below the shoulder, and he himself pushes the joint with his fingers or the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 If it is a dislocation towards the front: then he shall return it so that he divides his hand with the dislocated hand until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation does not obey in reduction, then administer a strong and powerful traction; and it is to extend the arm by two servants; and they shall hold it also, so that it may not be moved during the traction.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then the arm is turned to all sides after it slipped over his hand, covered with a double cloth or a broad bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the physician touches with his hand the joint, he shall bind it with oil; so that it may be one of those things which aid in lubricity at the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then push the joint with a strong impulse until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After its reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be placed upon it, which contains styptics and drying with egg white; and it shall be tied with an appropriate ligature.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 And the arm of the sick person shall be suspended from the neck for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then it is loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If the joint is strengthened in its place, then loosen the bandage from it and release it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see that the joint is not bound well, then repeat the plaster, and bandage, and leave it for some days until it becomes bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If there is pain after the reduction of the joint and it has motion: then administer humectation in the bath, and fine friction, and compression until it lines up, or place upon the joint, that is, fat of the ram's wool.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then bind it and leave it on it for a day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it and insert it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 When it sweats, then rub the joined part with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then, three times on the same place with a heated iron, and at each introduction of the bath until it becomes soft.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you wish, place upon it cow dung, moistened and heated with butter, and press down on it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 It becomes soft and returns to its original condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 Section on the treatment of dislocations by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 Almahassem's hand is often dislocated, that is, the join between arm and hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 The reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 Contrariwise, other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, it is necessary that speed should be present in the reduction of this dislocation within the hour when it occurs, before the place is allowed to become swollen; or else a warm abscess may occur in that place.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 The reduction of this dislocation is as follows: Place Almahassem's weak hand on a table, and extend the minister's hand; and let the physician place his palm on the prominence of the joint, and push it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, it should be considered if the palm has already retreated into the wrist of the hand; then let the weak side place its back of the hand on the table for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be internally on the table, that is, the inner part of the hand should be placed on the table, so that the physician can fall on the prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If it therefore returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then press it with a dressing on the swelling abscess; and leave it alone, without repeating the procedure.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 If it does not endure [the reduction], nor can you make another attempt upon it, after the days have passed, yet the connection remains according to its twistiness; and nothing harms the weak except what is softened by the hand, and nothing can be tightened: then you will know that the nerves have been cut or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 There is no skill in it except to tighten it with a cautionery near its loss.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps that does not benefit it at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 When therefore Almahassem does not return, then place upon him an ointment as we have said.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then it is tightened and allowed for five days; afterwards it is loosened and allowed, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If its motion is deprived and something of gravity happens to it: then soften it with warm water and rubbing several times until it becomes soft.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 [Chapter on the Treatment of Finger Dislocations.]
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated in any direction or the finger is dislocated to the back of the palm or its ventrum: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then hold the head of the finger and suspend it turned to the side to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then suspend it, and extend it until it becomes straight on that day itself.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When therefore it is night, tie it according to the said account; and do not cease to loosen it during the day; and exercise it with movement; and tie it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do that for several days until it is tightened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And likewise do the same if it is dislocated to the palm of the hand; and tie it to that part itself, and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And similarly do with it when it is dislocated to other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 On the treatment of spondylolisthesis of the spine.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When it happens to someone that the vertebra of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure in it, because death approaches the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And a sign of this is that the weakness of the patient goes out involuntarily and it cannot be held; and often some of his limbs become soft or two legs of his, or two arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 For it is often removed (dislocated), which often happens for its removal in four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 Therefore, what is dislocated towards the rear, is called a humpback.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 The cure of this (humpback) is that you consider whether it happens from childhood; then there is no cure in it and there is no healing at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 But in that which happens by accident, or by blow, or similar things, the ancients have already spoken of the methods of treatment at length in a long speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 It does not often return with recovery.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 I myself have already abbreviated from that which does not leave much hope for recovery due to my proximity to the intention of the subject; and in my explanation, I have presented it, and formed its instrument differently from how they presented it and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, I say that in a humpback which happens from the front part, there is no cure and no healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly, in one which happens on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not cured from them, except for that which happens on the back properly, as I said; and there is a way to stretch out the weak person face down on an equal flat surface nearly up against a wall; and a wet rug is spread under him so as not to injure his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then place a straight stick fixed in the fire on the ground, at the end of the foot, about its head: and another stick about its feet at the other end of the foot: and let the servant hold the stick, and it not be fixed in the fire.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And let another servant hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then cover the head of the sick one and tie a soft bandage firmly around his neck, and extend the end of the bandage to the stick that is at his head and bind it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then tie another bandage above his ankles and above his knees, and at the joints of his limbs.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the bindings together and tie them to the other stick that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then each servant should extend the bandage to the part of the stick and the two sticks shall not be moved from their places where they are fixed, but they shall not be fastened, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the physician should place his hands on the hip bone with force until it returns or he places a board over it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he connects his feet to the board until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If it does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And make a hole in the wall near the sick one, into which the end of the board is to enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the middle of the board on the hip bone.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And the physician should place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And tie it tightly until the hip bone is dislocated and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then, if you wish, work with a roller that is turned by hand: and it is so that you press into the ground near the head of the sick one at the end of the foot two sticks, whose length is an arm: and at the head of him at the end of the foot two sticks.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And let the length be one palm between every stick; and already a hole has been made in every place where the tourniquet runs; and let all sticks be firmly fixed on the ground, so that they do not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 And insert a round stick; and there is a tourniquet in which the ligament is revolved in two holes of two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at its end there is a hole, in which the stick is fastened, whose length is one palm plus the part that is revolved; and similarly on two other sticks.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then tighten the ligaments which you tied on the chest of the sick man at the tourniquet that is near his head; and the ligaments which you tied on his legs at the tourniquet that is near his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then stand by every tourniquet an assistant who will twist his hand with a linen cloth, with which the tourniquet is revolved; and the doctor presses the sponge, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 Here is the form of the tourniquet that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then, when the sponge returns and the place is pressed again, then it is necessary that you put on an asringent plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then apply a woolen material (stuffing).
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 After that, place on top of the plaster a star-shaped piece of wood, whose width is three fingers or approximately so.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length should be such that it covers the hump and the healthy part of the sponge.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then bind it with the ligament as we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And the sick man should be given subtle food until he is cured.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If something remains as a hump in the place at the end of healing, then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe, with the use of the board that I have mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now the plate of lead is administered (to the patient).
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 Whenever an eminence happens at the last vertebra of the back; and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that bone which projects (is present).
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore, it is not fitting for this medicine to be assumed presumptuously; perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the articulation of the ankle and the articulation of the shoulder do not occur except by dislocation; nor does what happens to the other joints occur in them from a slight displacement or concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 And indeed, the articulation of the ankle is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 Because it is dislocated towards the front and towards the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 It is mainly dislocated towards the inner parts; it is scarcely dislocated towards the front and the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 The treatment for dislocation of this [bone] towards the inner parts is as follows: because when you join a weak leg to a sound one, it is longer; and the knee of the weak one protrudes more than that of the healthy one, and the weak cannot double its foot at the groin; and there is a place behind the groin that has been pierced with a hot iron due to this, because the head of the hip has reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 The sign of [bone] dislocation towards the outer parts is that its symptoms are opposite to these symptoms [mentioned earlier].
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 The sign of [bone] dislocation towards the front is that it stretches a healthy leg to its full extent; however, it does not double the limb without pain in the knee; and if he tries to walk on it, he cannot do so towards the front; and his urine is retained, and his groin is pierced with an iron, and during walking, there is kicking of it against the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 The sign of [bone] dislocation towards the back is that it does not stretch out the knee nor can it double it before doubling the groin; and its leg is even shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place [of the dislocation].
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction of this dislocation is as follows: one should consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has become fixed in the patient.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then, if you administer reduction of it and it remains in its position; then there is no treatment at all in this case.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, one should not make a hasty presumption about him.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In the case of a recent dislocation, which belongs to one of four dislocation types; then, you should hasten to this, that you apply pressure and stretch it both towards the inner parts and towards the outer parts, and move it left and right; perhaps it will return and require no further treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant and extend his leg from the lower part; either with his own hands, or with a strap that can be tied above the knee: and another assistant shall extend his hand upward, so that he may introduce his hands beneath the armpits.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then tie a gentle strap over the root of the hip and hold the end of another strap.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And let its extension be either from the front of the groin to the neck part, or from behind to the back part.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And let their extension be equal in all parts, until the weak one is raised from the ground with his body and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 For this kind of extension is the common shape of the four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If therefore the dislocation returns as we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for all kinds to do what I will say regarding its treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In the reduction of its own kind, when the dislocation is toward the interior parts, it is necessary for the weak one to lie on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then place a strap over the root of the hip, where it is between the head of the hip and the place that is below the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the strap upward from the groin to a higher part of the body, to the neck part.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then another strong assistant shall take his arms and reduce the large place of the weak hip, and extend it with a vigorous extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this kind is easier than the other kinds of treatment, by which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If it is excused above you and does not obey you for the introduction with this kind of treatment altogether; then it is necessary to tie together both the weak feet with a strong strap, gentle, over both heels and both knees: and let the length of each one be four fingers in breadth: and let the weak leg be extended more than the other by two digits.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then the sick person is suspended over the head of a beam, which should be in the house; and let the length of it from the ground be equal to two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then order a strong youth to brace the head and thighs; another youth supports the sick person with him; and another youth pushes, bracing the thighs with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In its reduction, when there is a dislocation towards the outside, it is necessary that the sick person lies on a platform, as we have said in one who has a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And bind the ligament on his foot, tightly for the sick person, and on his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two beams are placed, one at his feet, and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then place an additional beam in the middle of the platform, firmly fixed; on which are rolled wet cloths, so as not to hurt the sick person; and let there be a beam between his thighs, so that he is not drawn towards the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then all the assistants should go to their places, and the doctor equalizes the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If therefore it yields to reversal, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place it on the platform and press it equally, as we have said in one who has a hump.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Nevertheless, the sick person should lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when dislocation is towards the front, then it should be extended quickly the leg of the sick person; and this has the same story on the platform; and the doctor puts his right hand's palm on the thigh of the sick person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then bend him with one hand, and with this bending put him extended towards the lower parts to the knee-part.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 If dislocation is towards the back: then it is not necessary that the sick person should be extended towards the lower parts and raised up from the ground; rather it is necessary that he should be placed on a hard surface, as it is also necessary if his ankle is dislocated towards the outside, according to what we have said about lying him on two surfaces: and it should be on his face and the extended ligaments: according to what we have recently said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 It is necessary that a compression be administered with a board even over the joint to which it extends, when reduction is completed as required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of its reduction will not be hidden to you: and it is, that you extend two legs of the weak: and when you see them equal, and the weak man stretches his leg, and expands it without dislocation: then you will know that the limb has returned as required: then join two hips, and apply plaster, and bind with lint, that is, wheel: thus, so that it does not move sideways to any part: and the weak man remains quiet for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then loosen the binding, and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in position, then you will know that the dislocation is now fixed: release therefore the weak man for walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see something softening: then return, and apply plaster to it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it for three days as well.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then loosen that and make it slow in walking on both sides for some days until it recovers well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 Chapter on Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and downwards, that is, backwards.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated forwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the weak man to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 If it does not cling with the hip: then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all ways of dislocation is that you make the weak man sit upright, so that he can extend his leg if possible over it, and let his back touch his face: and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then attach (it) to the leg with your hands, and straighten them on top of the leg.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Apply with the palm of your hand two sides of the leg with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 Let another servant extend the foot until the leg returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 And a sign of return is that the thigh and shin adhere gently, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then apply plasters to it, and make the thigh and shin adhere.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind them together with ointment for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then loosen (them).
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 Let the sick person not walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 If the reduction of it (leg) is refused to you, then administer a strong extension with cords, whose treatment for dislocation of the ankle has been described earlier, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 Chapter on the cure of the dislocation of the heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XLII.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The heel is sometimes moved slightly out of place and at other times it is dislocated completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 And its dislocation happens either towards the inside or outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 A sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and protruding towards the direction to which it has been dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 But the cure for its removal is easy reduction, and it is as follows: (it) should be extended with ease by hands and aligned until it returns to its place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 When it is completely dislocated, in its treatment it is necessary to make the sick person sit straight and a strong servant hold him from behind in the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold the foot with your right hand from above it and with your left hand from below the foot at the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 Then with two fingers (on) the left side.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Extend (your hand) with the left, and push the chest with your foot turned to the right leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do that twice, as we have told you.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the chest with your foot to the leg on the third time and you draw (out) the splinter.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If it comes back in the first or second time according to this method and you see the foot equalized, that is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, because it will come out again.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 If its reduction with what we have told you is forbidden to you: then make the sick person lie on his back on the ground and place a firm wooden peg firmly fixed in the ground so that he falls between his thighs; and now you have rolled him over onto it with a cloth, so that he does not hurt the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then the servant takes his thigh; afterwards, another servant extends his leg or with his hands, or with a strap that binds around its neck.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then all the servants extend themselves in opposition to his extension; and the peg remains standing between the thighs of the sick person holding him so that his body is not drawn downward by the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor equalizes the displacement with his hands, and another servant holds the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 For a dislocation comes back quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When the dislocation returns and the recovery is declared to you, then put plaster and wax, and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And it is necessary that you be careful or afraid of the nerves that are above the heel at the back, so that the bandage is not too tight and hurts them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then let him go for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the ligament is softened, tie it up; then dissolve it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 If he attempts to walk before that time, there is no certainty that it will not be dislocated again and spoiled; nor will he receive cure after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If it happens to him that there is a hot abscess: then it is necessary that you administer to his sedation what we previously described for treatment elsewhere, and apply embrocation until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 Chapter on the dislocation of fingers and cure.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that it be equated which is dislocated with little extension without effort; and indeed, this is not difficult but easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 If the dislocation is in some nodes of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the sick person make his foot sit on a level place with the ground or on a table; and he stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand, and put your foot upon that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then press it with your foot with force until it returns and you see it already equated, and the protrusion does not appear in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then put a board under his foot's belly which takes the whole foot, with two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then tie it up with a bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then dissolve it and let him rest from walking for many days until it is bound and secured against relapse.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 Chapter on the types of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When something happens to it and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often occurs; therefore, one should not presume over its cure unless he is experienced in the art of long use, merciful, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous: and that he uses only remedies that calm hot abscesses, and leaves the sick person to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 If thou seest not, or hopest for salvation from destruction with mildness of disease, and where something appears of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Strive therefore for the reduction of it at once at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If the limb therefore returns as we desire, then administer a regime which restrains the abscess; and take care of the wound with that which agrees with it from dry ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If there is a dislocation together with a fracture, and separated sores occur on the bone, then strive for the removal of them, and do as we said in simple diseases in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And beware according to your strength, and keep yourself from entering into the way of fear; according to what my discourse preceded for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For that is better for thee at thy Creator, and more lasting for thy glory, and more safe for thy body among them in thy time.
