Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed for you, children, this book, which is the last of the science in medicine with its completion, and have reached its end in its expositions and its declarations, it has seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise, which is a part of operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the operation with the hand has been laid low in our region and in our time utterly private—until perhaps its science has perished, and its trace has been cut off—and there remain from it only small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been altered by hands, and error and hesitation have befallen them, until its intentions have been closed, and its sight has been withdrawn—it has seemed to me to revive it with the ordering of this treatise in it, according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation, and to come with forms of cautery instruments and the other instruments of the work, with the addition of declaration and with the hastening of that which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The cause however for which a good craftsman of it is not found with his hand in this our time is: that the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen narrated, until he knows the aids to the limbs, and their forms, and their connection and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their exits, and of the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their exits.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of that Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with a work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We however have already said about that in the introduction of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since he who is not knowledgeable about what we have said regarding anatomy is not deterred from falling into error, whereby people are killed, just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science and boast about it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut an abscess in the neck of a woman, and cut some arteries in the neck, wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man who had advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he reached it and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And indeed I had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the disposition of the sick man, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician, with his ignorance, hurried and bound the fracture over the wound with pillows and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound any breathing space.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he dismissed him according to his own desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards, he dismissed him after a few days, and instructed him not to loosen the bandage: and he stood like that until his leg and his foot were festered, and he arrived at death.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	Therefore, I was called to him: and I hurried to loosen the bandage: and tranquility followed, and he escaped from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already become confirmed in the limb: and I was unable to restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, the corruption ceased to wander in the limb until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician, who pierced the cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated after days, until its malice increased with its master.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is because when the cancer is pure, from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate its being completely severed.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And therefore, children, it is necessary for you to know that surgery, with the hand, is divided into two divisions: namely, surgery to which health is joined; and surgery with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already roused in every place of this book, in which comes the surgery, in which is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of it, and to diminish it, so that fools may not find a way to speak ill of and dishonor it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, take the measure with diligence and protection, and your sick with ease and firmness, and use the better path leading through God's grace to health and praiseworthy success; and leave the terrible illnesses of difficult cure; and remove your souls from that which causes you fear, so that hesitation may not enter into your faith and your advantage.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For there remains more for your glory, and higher things in this world, and finally for your possessions.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad physician.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	However, I have now divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Concerning the cautery with fire, and the cautery with sharp medicine, detailed and arranged from head to foot, and the forms of instruments, and the ironwork of the cautery, and everything that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Concerning incision and perforation, phlebotomy and cupping, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things: and all detailed, arranged in the form of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third Chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things: detailed, arranged from head to foot, and the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Albucasis's Book of Surgery.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Concerning the benefit and harm of the cautery; and with which complexions it is suitable, and at what time; and if with iron, or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary for me to speak of the quality of its benefits and harms, and in what complexion it should be applied.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say, therefore, that the discussion of the quality of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a matter of knowledge and hidden secrets.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Many wise men have spoken on it, and disagreed; and for me, a little from their words is enough, fearing length.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say, therefore, that cautery benefits every complexion, with or without matter, except for two complexions: a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, they disagreed about the hot and dry complexion with matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that cautery is helpful in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite, namely that cautery is not suitable in an illness caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat; and it is unsuitable that one be healed from a hot and dry illness by heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite stated that through cautery, help is given in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare a human body and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say through his statement: because experience has already shown me that on several occasions.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not appropriate for one to come upon it unless one has already been proven and trained in the final exercise of the cautery chapter, and has known the diversity of human complexions and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their duration of time.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the other complexions, however, there is no fear for you; and especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For now all physicians have agreed upon them, and have not disagreed in their use of cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, children, that from the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach except the member that is cauterized, and does not harm another member joined to it, except with small harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distanced from the members, and perhaps causes illness of difficult healing in a member, and perhaps kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now, however, that has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and our station upon the truth of things; and for that reason I excuse myself from the length of the discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would present to you the hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation on bodies of its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses with a demonstrative philosophical discourse, which would be sharpened by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, children, that they disagree on the time in which the cautery should be applied, and prefer the time of spring.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, because the harm that is incidental to the time is submerged in the benefit that is attracted by the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate slowness; because it is feared that from them greater harm will result than the slight harm caused by delay.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it enter your minds, O children, that which only the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely, that the illness cured by cautery does not always return; and they consider that a consequence, and the matter is not as they suppose: because cautery is not unless in the place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries the humidities which are the cause why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cautery surpasses medicine in the swiftness of its cure, and the power of its action, and the vehemence of its dominion; and it is possible for the illness to return at some time according to the patient's complexion, and the location of his illness, and its power; and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it; and what comes to him in its acquisition from foods and similar causes, unless it be an illness in which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in a limb from few superfluities and humidities, such as toothache, and similar to it, for pain; it is possible that that pain will not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But truly the common people's assertion that cautery is the last resort of medicine is correct; not for what they intend by that, since they believe that there is no cure that compares with medicine, nor any after the cautery has passed.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	However, the matter is the opposite of that, and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is not, except that when we administer methods of treatment for some illness, and those medicines do not work; then we administer cautery at the end of things, and it works: then from there it falls, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention understood by the common people and many unskilled physicians.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	However, the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say that except because of the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance; and they said that the place of the cautery does not produce pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely so; since I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, just as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you make a cautery of fire from gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the quantity you desire, because of the redness of the gold; and when it rapidly approaches the cold, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls from that occupation; and because of that, cautery with iron is quicker and more effective with us, by reason of its suitability for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I indeed have already arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters; and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that they may alleviate the seeker of what they wish from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization is beneficial in controlling the excess of moisture and coldness in the brain; these two are causes of headaches, and of the flow of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of excessive sleep, and toothache, and sore throat; and universally, every sickness that arises from cold, such as paralysis, headaches, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is, that you should first prescribe to the sick person a cleansing, resolving medicine for the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands in a square posture, so that he has placed his hands upon his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever therefore your middle finger arrives, mark that place with the cautery.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the olive-shaped cautery to the fire.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place him upon the place marked with the cautery, descending, so that your hand is gradually constrained, and you revolve him.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift your hand, and observe the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see now exposed from the bone a quantity of alkali or a quantity of zeuherb, then raise your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from it if it cools down: until the bones, which I told you, appear.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak in it cotton, and place it on the place, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place on top of the cotton soaked in butter, and leave it on the place, until the scab of fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the four-drug ointment, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more it emits pus: therefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape away that which has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to reach the ultimate with the cautery, until it makes an impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, which is done like the shape of a kirate; or the instrument that women use in pouring small alphabetic ink.  And they believe that vapors from the head are driven out from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it until it is consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	However, these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be at all appropriate except in some men according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it [the wound] is, in my opinion, better with regard to his health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the breaking of its natural continuity, as we have testified in the other members; and especially when the head of the weak person is naturally feeble.  And indeed the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore operate with it in health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs in the whole head, and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses leeches, and cupping, and head-purges, and oils, and emollients.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with the one cautery that we have described, and if none of those [treatments] helps him, then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and not weak, and it finds a vehement cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly under the [previous] one.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it above every horn of its head with a cautery, so that it does not pierce the skin, and a quantity of bone, as we have described, is uncovered.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with a single cautery on the occiput of its head, in the place called *vas* (or vessel): and it is the place where a cupping is placed.  And elevate your cautery in this, and do not uncover bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the sick person finds, because of that, a vehement pain, and different from the pain of the other cauteries of all the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I say that this cautery should be in its place: and it should be a cautery with which the horns of the head and its occiput are cauterized, a finer cautery than the one used for cauterizing the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a hemicrania, both with a cauterizing medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed with purifying medicines, and the remaining treatment, which I described in the divisions of illnesses, is administered, and it does not benefit the whole: then cauterization is performed in it according to two methods: either cauterization with a burning, sharp medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cauterium with a burning, sharp medicine is to take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then dissect the painful area at the time with a broad phlebotom, until a space under the skin is made in which the clove is placed.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it into the space beneath the skin until it is hidden; then bind over it with a suitable constricting bandage, and leave it for a quantity of fifteen hours, then loosen it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days. Afterward, apply to it a poultice soaked in butter until the area produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I wrote in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization of it with iron, however, is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The cautery iron, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a nail, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is something of a curve, and in its middle there is a small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it upon the place, and hold your hand; and you shall turn the iron gradually with speed; and the quantity that is burned shall be from the thickness of the skin, like half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak a cloth in salt water, and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; then place a cloth with butter; afterward treat with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife-edge.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not an old one properly.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterizing an old hemicrania.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When treating hemicrania, with what we have said from the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and if the treatment does not help; and you see from the disease that what we have said about the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient, then it is necessary to heat the cautery knife until it turns white after you have marked the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that; and place your hand on one side, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves during mastication, lest the side or nerve that moves it be burned, whence spasm may result.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard, and cautious of the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its cutting lies danger, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not diligent or skilled; and he abandons the operation with it at the outset.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with a reminder of the regimen for the blood flow occurring from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the sickness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with the cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cauterization is better and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	Concerning the method of cauterization in earache.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When earache occurs from cold, and is treated with remedies, and the rest of the treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then apply a cautery: and it is that which is called the Point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then, after its ignition, points with it around the entire ear, as it revolves; or around each, if the pain is in both at the same time.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And move the cautery slightly away from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with ink: and let the quantity of cautery be ten points in each ear, and like that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the places until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture that is cured with cauterization is only from the types that arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of torture with leeches, and head-cleansings, and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize the afflicted with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second slightly lower on its temporal area, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the afflicted part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the tip of the upper part of the ear, below the horn of the head, slightly; and another on the temporal region, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type from the knife, whose form was previously mentioned; however, it is not much thinner than that, as you see; and it ought to be a knife with a little superfluous thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the places with that which preceded, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterization in ancient Apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When the apoplexy is longstanding, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment is of no benefit, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries upon each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and with a cautery in the back of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of the cautery should be according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also, cauterize with a cautery on the opening of the stomach; and this is more of a last resort.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then, treat him with what preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Forgetfulness.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that large doses of hyerae and pills that cleanse the brain be given to the sick person first.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the sick person's whole head, and place on his occiput a plaster of synapis as described in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For this is the method of the cautery; and do it according to the same order as I have said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If, therefore, it heals by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then make three cauteries on the posterior part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye; and place the thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cautery, with what went before.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish an addition, and the sick person is tolerant of it, then make a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat him until he is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form which was given previously.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery above each horn of the head, and with a cautery above its back, and with three above the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If, however, in the sickness there is a need for softening the body with more than those, and the sick person is tolerant, and the illness is severe: then cauterize him with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and lastly with a cautery, until most of his skin is burned, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then treat him until he is healed: and thus the cautery is Olive.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the other treatment that we have described in the division, when the patient is strong, or is tolerant in taking medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and chewing motions that cleanse the brain are administered, many days beforehand with improvement in the diet.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner: and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery over every horn of his head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If however, the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned in the case of paralysis, and for the softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method which preceded.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of downward melancholic influence, and the patient's body is moist, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what has been previously described in the division: then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a neatly fashioned pad of linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head, and the patient, seated upright, must be held in place on all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is better made from old sheep's butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over a fire with a moderate amount of heat, such that a finger can tolerate it when placed inside.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then apply it to the center of his head in a circular motion, and let it remain until it cools.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this for the sick person once every week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures throughout it, so that you hold the cautery, indeed, while smelling it.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this type of cautery moistens the brain with quality.

When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs, which I have stated in the division, then begin and let the weak drink it, with that which will cleanse his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And guard him from all moisture, and make him sit in a bath, in fasting for a few days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him over both temples with two cauteries, if the descent of water is in both eyes simultaneously; or from one side, if the descent of water is in one eye; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin; and let the cauteries be long in the width of the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything from it, then cut it away immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and caution against the flow of blood.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old, persistent, and are above the veins and arteries that are on the exterior head, it is ascertained that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities, then cauterize with the same cautery as I have described in the beginning of descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck under the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if it needs further application, then cauterize it on every side of the eye cautiously, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on every side: and they should be spaced apart by two times their width: and the length of each cautery should be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not bring your hand with the cautery to the furthest point, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burned.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of lunar cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are inverted and prick the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery is of two types: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cautery with fire, first instruct the patient to remove his hairs, if he is one who trims them, until they are extended and equal.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, they prick him at their origin, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow out.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they have grown out and are equal, then place the patient's head in your lap; then mark upon the eyelid of his eyes with ink, a mark in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape that you marked, gradually in many stages, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned away.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting, and the hairs rising near the puncture of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore, lift your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place over it a poultice with butter, until the eschar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any of the hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid softens, then cauterize that place again, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If however the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural position and made even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is that you command the infirm person to let the hairs grow until they are extended and even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper on cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap and from unleached lime each a weight of one ounce or nearly that: then rub them together with good trituration, and do it quickly, lest it become cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then take from the paste that you made from it over the paper that you made as the form of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or of two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a poultice soaked in egg white: and let the head of the infirm person be in your bosom.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it a little.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you shall move it whenever the infirm person feels the biting of the medicine: because its biting is found as fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore that which he finds as biting persists, then leave the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider, if you see the eyelid rise, as it rises upon contraction with fire, or with incision, it is well; and if not, then again place upon it of the medicine upon the place where the medicine does not imprint, and does not darken, until your operation is equalized, and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place upon it Cotum with butter, until the skin of the burn is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you in the operation, that you guard the ultimate guard, lest anything of the medicine fall into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after days, and something fights out of the hairs into the eye, then again place medicine upon that place which softens from the eyelid properly, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to that let your consideration be: and the path of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a study of this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a tear duct fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, in the same way as we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then you ought to cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Tell the sick person to place their head in your lap, and let the attendant hold their head between their hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with their head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a cautery, steeped in egg white or in psyllium mucilage, on their eye.  Then, apply the cautery, the shape of which is like this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to penetrate right to the other end, and if you wish it to be held so upwardly.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and draw out the pus from it, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it, and draw out its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the cautery, made very hot, upon it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with the cautery near the eye, toward the nose, so that your hand does not wander or the sick person be disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you reach the beginning of your cautery up to the bone, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place a bandage with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If forty days have passed and it is not healed, then place a sharp corrosive medicine on it, until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what is in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first [practitioners] said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Attend to the location of the fistula, and split it; then place in the fissure a fine camahan, that is, a fine cannula, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a drachm of melted lead, and hold your hand with the cannula firmly, and let the sick person not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place over the sick person's eye a poultice soaked in egg white, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the area of the fistula and heals it with a remarkable cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed by what we have said of cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal passage, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will come to its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	Concerning the method of cauterization in lip fissures.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Often fissures occur in the lip, which are called hairs, and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you treat these fissures, as we have said in the division of diseases, and treatment is not effective, then use a small knife cautery with fire, according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place it, heated, quickly onto the fissures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a cautery, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	Concerning the method of cauterization in a fistula of the mouth.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth; then it forms pus and bursts; afterward it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and treatment does not help it, then it is necessary to cauterize the fistula with a cautery according to its size.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its depth and end, do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterwards with what we have said about treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the pus is cut off and it heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what is in its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum softens because of moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with remedies, and it does not help: then place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then, with fire, a cautery, whose shape will come after these things, so that you place the cannula on the tooth: and quickly insert the heated cautery into it: and hold your hand for a short time, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire having already reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to your will.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the sick person fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and let him spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the moved tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	On the method of cauterizing in toothache.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or worm within, and treatment with medicines does not help: then a cautery should be applied to it in two ways: either a cautery with butter, or a cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	Its cautery with butter is that you should take fresh butter and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a wick, and wrap it around the end of the probe.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse it in the boiled butter, and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat it several times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, immerse wool or a wick in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place heated iron upon it until fire reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	Its cauterization with fire is to hold a bronze or iron cannula.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of its thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the infirm person's bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then, take a cautery whose shape will come, and place it upon that tooth, and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do it several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or on another.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary, in the impression of that cautery, that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for one hour, then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever extremity you are able, and this is the shape of the Cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Strophuls.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter Twenty-four.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When strophuls are caused by phlegm and cold humors, and are not amenable to digestion by medicines, and their digestion is required swiftly, then use a concave cautery, whose shape is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, so that smoke may escape from the cautery through the other extremity; and place it, ignited, upon the abscess once, and a second time, if it needs it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice infused in butter, until that which the fire burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with a tooth ointment, until the shape of the cannula is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When humidities overcome the bronchial tube, and especially when it is with a cold complexion, then it is necessary that the weak person be evacuated first with loosening medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it in the nocrati at the root of the throat in a depressed place; and beware, lest you reach with the cautery to the throat, nor to the skin, unless something of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck in the last vertebra of it, finishing it; and let the cautery be narrow according to the manner that preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	Concerning the method of cauterization in diseases of the lungs and cough.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the illness is long-standing, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in low, smooth, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be of a tube shape according to the form that preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if your desire is cauterization by puncturing with a cautery, which is called "Punctum," whose form preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures, up as though to others.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with that which preceded, until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore, cauterization will be alleviated when you do it with three cauteries at one time.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	Concerning the method of cauterization in the Titillico, in the dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and does not fix itself at the time of its return from dislocation, until it is accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a small movement which happens as we have already testified, then you should reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient should be laid on their back, or on their healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then raise the skin that is in the inner Titillico upwards with the fingers of your left hand, and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then take a cautery iron with two prongs.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, why then the figure of the cauterization is of six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the fineness of the thread.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added to this manner, why there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place crushed leeks with salt upon the cautery.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then make the weak person adhere to tranquility, so that the limb does not move at any time, until it is strengthened.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upwards, and rarely does that happen, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach, until they draw it out of its complexion, and phlegm multiplies upon it, and assiduous methods of treatment do not help: then it is necessary that the sick person be laid on his back, and extend his legs and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery beneath the spoon of the chest the size of one finger with a clauili cautery, and two cauteries below on either side of a single cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen between each so they do not join, when they will make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cautery be the amount of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery which makes this cautery be one according to the form of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by pricking him who is terrified by this cautery: and it is, that you mark upon the stomach a point according to the quantity, which you wish with encaustic: then cauterize it with a cautery of the point: then care for it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	Of the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and moisture, or from thick wind, until it departs from its natural complexion by an excess discharge, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the sick person be placed on his neck, and mark with encaustic three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity over the lower liver below the hypochondria, where the man's elbow reaches: and let the space that is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body straight: and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of that which is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, a quantity of half of it, not added: and let the sick person stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If however he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is possible for you, indeed, to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when there is subtlety and prudence in your art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself so that you do not proceed too quickly in the cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, for then the entire body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if the abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person is afflicted with pain, and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is intense sharpness with the pain; and you see already that the treatment has wearied its physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, the sick person should lie on their back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then mark the location of the abscess with ink; then apply a cautery that resembles a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it one cautery, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for exits, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not fitting for one to use this type of cautery unless their study in the medical art is prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have run their course with experience many times; then indeed may they dare to perform this sort of operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But truly, to abandon it is better for me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Pleuritis.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that cautery with aristolochia roots is for a cold pleurisy according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you should take from dry, long aristolochia roots, one root longer than the rest, and it should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil, and light it in fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery at the junction of the fork with the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly sloping downward to the area under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also at the area between the fifth and sixth ribs sloping slightly backward; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from behind: one at the area between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you should not press your hand with the cautery, rather it should be visible, smelling the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a rod; and they heat it and insert it into the area between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and pus comes out; just as we said in the case of a liver abscess.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the weak man dies immediately or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the spleen, Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat the illness of the spleen, according to what we have said about treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then a cautery should be used in it in three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is to make three or four cauteries, drawing lines along the length of the spleen, in the shape of the liver cauteries, whose figure preceded this.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between each cautery a distance equal to the thickness of a finger, or a little more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of the cautery be the same as that which we described for the cautery of the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the sick person lie weak on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: to apply a cautery with two prongs, as we stated in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus; and lift the skin, which is directly over the spleen, where the sick person's left elbow reaches; and let your lifting of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them; then withdraw the cautery; thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then treat the cautery after you let it emit pus for many days; for it is more beneficial than all the previous treatments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall upon dropsy unless properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment that we have described in the division, and the treatment does not work, then you should cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery above the stomach, and another cautery above the liver, and a cautery above the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and the depth of the cautery should be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery open, so that it emits pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the sick person from treatment after the cautery with him; because it is necessary that two intentions be gathered in him: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, according to its previous form; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When abscesses develop in a hydrops patient, and they are filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize above the back of the foot, in the area between the auricular and annular bones.  Lift your hand with the cautery, and do not rotate it; then lift your hand, and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the blade end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg; and above each thigh, make two cauteries.  And leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may sweat out from it; then treat it with the other things which we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Concerning the method of cauterization in abdominal distension.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When abdominal distension is caused by cold and moisture, weakening the retentive and digestive powers of the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with methods of cure, but does not heal; and you see a weak patient tolerating a cautery of exuberant power, then cauterize him with a large cautery upon his stomach, according to what preceded in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery, and with four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle nail-shaped cautery; and with a large cautery above the kidneys, or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture, and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the breastbone, and with a cautery on each hip; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For this is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted moisture, and are treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries above the lower spine of the back under the almeidati a little triangularly, and with a cautery under the navel by about two fingers' breadth.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming suppurated, then cauterize him above the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and with a cautery above his liver, and another on his spleen, with a clauili cautery: and leave the cautery open for a time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise althelul, then cauterize with a cautery that resembles a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the burning cautery into the excised althelul: and with the last of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein through which blood flows: do this once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them, with that which is beneficial to them from ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more effective in helping.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not respond to the incision and operation that we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is cured with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	Therefore, when a fistula occurs in someone, and it becomes chronic, pus flows from it, and corrupted humors.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore, it is more fitting that you probe it with a thin probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then ascertain its depth with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then heat the cautery, which is like a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself the ignited cautery into the fistula, and the quantity in which the cautery entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery on it, until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And beware of burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula goes to the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then beware of all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this, unless the fistula is in a fleshy place, and you think it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then treat the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If however the place is sealed, and the matter is cut away from it, and it remains thus for a long time, then know that it is now completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if matter is not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupt opening is within it, or something like that from those, the remembrance of which will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter Thirty-Nine.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from a thick wind, and it lessens because of that of the sick person, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the almethen upon the kidneys themselves, with a cautery on every kidney with a cautery-clavil, the remembrance of which has preceded.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the almeidate itself.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore, three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, the last will be more helpful.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, to the point where the sick person cannot retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic hair begin, and cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the summit and another from the left side of it; and let the length of this cauterization on each side be according to the width of a thumb's knot; and cauterize it with a cautery on the lower back, or with two cauteries, if that is necessary; and let this be according to the previous cautery's pattern.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and it is prevented from conception, and her menses are corrupted, and their expulsion is delayed, and pain occurs to her upon their arrival, then it is necessary that she be cauterized with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above, slightly below the back, or with two cauteries; and let the cautery be as before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When mucous humors discharge into the anus, and cause its expulsion from its place; and a sign of this is that one leg is prolonged over the other when compared together; and the place of the dislocation is found empty in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary that you cauterize the affected area above the anus itself with a similar circular cautery; after you mark it with ink in a circle around the anus as it revolves; and that the anus itself falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the form that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive cautery; and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and dampness; and the patient is treated with what we have stated in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it grows worse: then it is necessary to free the patient from thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization in it is according to two ways: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cautery with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is that you cauterize over the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space between each cautery be the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, a cautery is made in the middle above the head of the hip itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the hip dislocation, one: so that the circle contains the whole hip.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery for Sciatica, when the pain adheres to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	However, if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, over the place where the sufferer points there, where the pain is, and with your cautery on the shin four fingers to the wild side for a little while: and let the cautery be a knife-like one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the sufferer indicates that the pain extends to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a point cautery, three, or four, or more if it needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-like cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauterizations, lest you overdo it with the cautery so as to burn the nerve, or a large artery, and thus bring upon the sufferer ill harm, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And truly I have already seen one and another, from those who have cauterized above the ankle and have overdone it in the cauterization, and the leg has swollen until the swelling reached the foot, and it was entirely perforated and the whole foot was corrupted: then there happened a loosening of the abdomen, and death afterwards.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain learned men said in the cauterization of the anca, of which this is the method of cautery.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter be half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date stone, or a little less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between every cautery be the quantity of a thumb's knot: and let the cauteries be open on both sides: and let their height be like a knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron fitting well into the cauteries.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in fire, until it turns red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed over the affected area of the anca, the sick person lying on their healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore cauterize it with three round cauteries at one time.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, with this kind of cautery, O children, we have used it little, because of the terror of its appearance, and because we have found few who will wait upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is a good cautery for him who endures it, and finds a place for it with him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	A cautery, however, is with burning medicines, so that you make two pieces of samian ware having a perforated armilla, into which descends a hinge of its gate, of bronze, or iron, the length of a wall: whose height should be two knots, or like themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space between both be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let that which contains them be joined together, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it upon a box of ashes, the sick person lying on their healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly upon the box of ashes.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been warmed with fire for a short time, and hold it for the amount of an hour: and let the sick person tolerate its burning, and its cauterization, for he finds the burning like fire, until the burning ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe the entire ash with sweet water; then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter upon it, until the blackness of the cauterization is removed; and leave it for a few days, and pus will run from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the last in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a poultice on it containing water, in the same manner as you did for the ash.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of warm water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and quicklime, each one part: grind both, and put them in a new pot, whose bottom is pierced with a small hole, according to the amount that the radius will enter it: and place another glass pot beneath the bottom of the pot: and pour over the alkali and lime fresh water, so that both are submerged by a finger's breadth: after that, press them with your hand with a good pressure; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water, and pour it over other lime; and strain it until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is used in many surgical operations and in cauterizing other limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among medicines with which the anca is cauterized, also like tesisie, and honey of anacard, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen, indeed, narrating, recounted the cure of a certain man from ancient times, by which the pain of the anca and sciatic vein was cured; and he praised it as being very great.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, because he did not require any further treatment, and because he was healed in one instance, until he recounted that perhaps he entered a bath carried, and emerged from it already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from green seitaragi; and if green is not found, let dry, fresh, be taken; and it shall be ground much with a little fat, and placed upon the anca, where the pain is, or the leg, or in the thigh; and it shall be bound, and left for a quantity of three hours, or for the quantity that the infirm person feels sedation of the burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then immerse him in a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes moist, immerse him in a chair.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that no one should use a cautery with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, who also said that the dung of goats, when cauterized with it the sciatic vein, benefits it: and the cautery is performed in this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it upon the deep place that is between the big toe and the sole, and is closer to the sole.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take the dry dung of goats, and burn it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it upon the wool, and let it be, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then do it again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore do not cease to do it, until the sensation above the mediation reaches the ankle, and the pain rests.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called cautery of the Vaccinum.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Concerning the cauterization of pain in the back.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain in the back occurs from many causes, either from an accident, or from a blow, or from the evacuation of superfluous matter, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter: and cautery indeed does not fall, except in this single type, which is made from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the evacuation of the patient with foul pills, and similar things, they should be placed on the back, where the pain is, three lines according to the width of the almeidati itself, after marking with ink in each line five cauteries, or more according to the amount that comes from the tolerance of the patient's strength: and let cauterization be done with a cautery-point.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a medial clauile cautery, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in the beginning stages of a humpback.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is: that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you find at the last of the spinal vertebrae of the back and its nodules, that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you see it, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cauterium that is a circle of this shape.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cauterium encompass the entire part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize in a circle of the vertebra with a pointed cauterium, make two or three lines; and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you apply the cauterium to the hump which results from a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in gout and pains of the joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When pains in the joints are from cold humours that flow to any part of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call it gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then the cauterium removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is that you cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose this is the form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to pierce on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and that often happens, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries from every side, with this same claw-shaped cautery.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If however more of this cautery are necessary for you, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said about the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If however the pains are only in the hands, then puncture the points in the circumference of the foci, as if two lines revolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If however pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, above each knot, and above the ridge of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not remove the sick person from a good regimen, from the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine, or the spermatic cord, descends towards the testicle, and it is in the beginning close by: then it is necessary that you command the sick person to give up eating on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use of the lenitives, so that the excrement descends from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands upon his back; and command him to hold his breath, until it emerges, or the spermatic cord, or the intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture above the pubic bone, with a sign whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then with a cautery of this form, until it comes white and throws off sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or spermatic cord, to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the assistant place his hand over the spot, so that the intestine does not come out; and you have now opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another servant over his legs, and another over his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery upon that mark, with your hand holding the cautery upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you meet with its mouth; or again with it a second time, if you have not met with its mouth in the first.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe for the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn it, and that death or great harm befall the sick person through it.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not meet with the mouth with the cautery, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And the cautery should be small for children, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat with the remaining ointments until it is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary to give him nourishment for the duration of his treatment, to soften his stomach, so that his intestines do not protrude during straining and bowel movements.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage and let him keep it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him abstain from work, and from a full diet of food and drink, and from loud noises.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he follows this regimen, he is thus completely healed.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will describe the treatment of Ruptures with incision in his chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen, and are incipient, and there is a need to prevent them from worsening, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let the part that is cauterized be thus about a third of its size.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat him with what we said, and it will not worsen.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some early authorities have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed that is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line to the lower side.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cautery iron.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to a fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When in some limbs pain from a fall or blow occurs, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery of each limb be a cautery according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twist, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed from the first cautery, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat the cautery upon it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because it is customary for these pains to shift from the limb to that which is near it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary to pursue them with cautery until the infirmity is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Leprosy sufferers are sometimes greatly helped by cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, consider the power to cauterize it itself.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If, therefore, the leprosy is persistent, and you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and it has neither subsided nor ceased; and you fear that the corruption may spread over his entire constitution: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the known head, and a second below it towards the forehead near the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind above the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And keep your hand with the cautery for a little while, until it makes a small impression on the mouth, and the bark peels away from it: so that the exhalation of gross vapors from it may be alleviated, and cauterize also the spleen with the cautery, as has been previously mentioned.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the afflicted person, and is clearly visible: then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two jaws, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and with six on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the alhasos near the base of the tail and one above it, on the almeidati itself; and with two on the anchas: namely, one on every ancha, and with two on the knees: one on each knee, and with two on the shoulders, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the soft parts of his chest; and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers and feet; and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the folds of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, lest you burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes a cautery is used on the comb bone, and another on the stomach bone, and another on the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more it is a help, and the more beneficial.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not experience pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that there be cauteries of varying sizes, and small, according to the members and joints; according to what was previously mentioned in the types of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the cautery with herb flour and honey, and with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a state of stupor.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize the numb limb with cauteries, according to the merit of the limb's size, whether great or small.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery enter the thickness of the skin a little.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes a cauterization is performed on something that is numb, which happens to the hand, and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exits of the nerves that move that limb, and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But let no one presume upon it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of the limbs, and the exit of the moving nerves of the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras is old and nothing from the arts of medicine helps it, then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and arnogloss leaves, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood; of each take one part: mix all these together, and spread them on a cloth, and apply to the place, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When the Cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, just as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	However, the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	However, it does not seem to me: because I fear that it will ulcerate, and I have already seen this happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excess making it so, or because of the infirmity of age, when he is decrepit, having little blood, or because of the time and the need to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Adubelati until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows the infirm, so that the course of pus may be relieved.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corrosive evil.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	Corrosion is not anything other than a corruption that walks in a member, and it corrodes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then use many cauteries of fire, small and large clamps, according to what will be suitable for that place where the corrosive is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains completely.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and place powdered sulfur with oil over the cauterized places, until all eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not, then repeat the cautery on whatever remains of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And it is sometimes cured by corrosive medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it indeed rises in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cautery with fire is of more rapid help; and I have already said that its cauterization with corrosive medicine is in division; therefore receive it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in corns and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This ailment often occurs in the lower parts of the feet, and is a thick, filtered substance that hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And cautery in them is of two kinds: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for cautery with fire, a concave cautery like the wing of a vulture should be heated; it should be made of iron, the size of the whole corn on all sides, and with thin edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it, heated, on the corn.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the corn, until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn, and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply a plaster with crushed wild mallows and salt, and leave the plaster on it overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It will indeed be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not cured and repeatedly occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply a cautery with hot water to them; and you should take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather, and place it on the corn, or blister.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, hold your hand, and revolve it with the pressure of your hand for a short while so that the edge of the cannula presses against the root of the corn and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the corn, and let the sick person wait for a while upon the soaking of the hot water for an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release him, for the corn is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with each of them one by one, until you have treated all that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When tremor occurs in someone due to cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries, or five, on the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on his chest with a cautery, and on his stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor ceases with the olive cautery, and the health of the cold ailment is hastened.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul things, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body of Albathir, which are formed from corrupted gross matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary first to cauterize every pustule on the head with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, whose tip has been heated with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way, and they are not increased; and the superfluity causing them is broken up, and they are healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary for this to be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Often a flow of blood from an artery occurs, which is cut in a wound, that happens externally, or in the incision of an abscess, or in the cauterization of a limb, and similar to them: and it becomes difficult to cut it off.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery, and press it firmly until the blood is obstructed beneath your finger, and nothing escapes from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place small, olive-shaped cauteries, and many larger ones, in the fire, and blow over them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been ruptured, and place the cautery on the vein itself, after you quickly remove your finger, and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not cease to do this with one after another, until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and another harm befall the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or let medicines of a nature to cut off the blood be placed upon it, and let it be tightened with a fitting constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	However, whoever performs its excision with a ligature and constriction with cloth, or by applying burning things, and similar methods, does not truly benefit it, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If, however, this happens to someone and a physician is not present, nor medicine: then let him begin with the placement of the index finger on the opening of the vein itself, as we have recounted, and with a strong constriction of it, until the blood is blocked from the upper part of the wound and over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not to be removed, but constantly kept over it with very cold water, until the blood is congealed and thickened, and cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, let him consider what it needs from a cautery, or from medicine.

Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Albucasis's Surgical Book, Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the first chapter, concerning every illness in which it is fitting to use cautery with fire, and burning medicine, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed there chapters from the head down to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path: so that the seeker might have his question alleviated.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, children, to learn that in this chapter there is fear from what is in the first chapter concerning cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that, it is necessary that there be greater caution in it, since in the operation which is in this chapter, often evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision on an abscess, or opening of an exit, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision on a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling, and fear, and death in many of them fall.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest that which is hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes the ways of men with the ways of illnesses fall upon you in this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For among them is he who is angry with his illness, and death is light to him; because of the intensity that he finds from his illness and the length of its malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with illness is fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is he who gives his money, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be stronger than your greed and your rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything of it, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies to you that to which praiseworthy success has come.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the treatment of all your sick people, prognostication and indication of that to which health may properly be.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that is help for you in the acquisition of fame and glory, and of memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God, O children, inspire you with his understanding, and may he not take from you direction and inspiration, for it is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have indeed ordered this Chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, in accordance with what preceded in the Chapter on Cauteries, from the neck down to the feet: so that your search for what you want from it, and what you need, might be eased.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Of the treatment of Water that gathers in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this ailment frequently happens to children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I myself have not seen this sickness in others than in children, and death has hastened to all whom I have seen of them: for that reason it seemed to me to omit treatment in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I myself saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until he could not sit on himself because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, indeed, either collects between the skin and the bone, or collects under the bone above the skin.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And if there is moisture between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head, with a width of approximately two fingerbreadths, until the moisture flows out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a lancet.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place these two incisions, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from every side, and water is depressed when you press it with your hand inward, and it is not hidden from you, then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the incisions with cloths and bandages.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then apply a fomentation of wine and oil to it until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not allow the head to be bound with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the weak person with all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and collection of water appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Of the incision of Arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When cataracts occur to someone in the eyes, or in the chest, and it is prolonged, and treatment with medicines is not effective, then the final treatment for that is the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you wish to cut them, the sick person should shave their head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick person should tighten their neck with any cloth they have.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of both are the locations which are depressed behind the ears; and it is rarely hidden, except in certain people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with ink on both; and cut both with a scalpel on both sides, the incision reaching the bone; and let that be across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood emerges with a pulsating outflow, which leaps inwards with frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If, however, the artery is not apparent to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear the amount of space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with ink, and cut all the way to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which it is necessary to remove from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you remove from it more, or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of that according to the quantity that appears to you from the weakness of the infirm and the fullness of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains on the bone from the sifac, then cut it, so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a person suffers from a chronic headache, or acute catarrhs due to acrid humors, and heat in the temple's tissues, or a severe, longstanding inflammation, and similar ailments: and is treated with the methods of medical treatment, and it does not help: then we have experience in these illnesses with the extraction of the arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in extracting them is that the patient should shave the hairs that are in the temples, and direct himself towards the visible artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it indeed shows itself to you by its pulse, and rarely is hidden except in a few people, or by the intensity of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then the patient should tighten his head with any cloth of his: then rub the area with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or warm the area with hot water, until it appears to you by clear appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I have formed a little earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upward, until you pull it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the tunics that are beneath it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is delicate: then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut a part of it according to the amount by which its extremities will be elongated and contracted, and so that no flow of blood occurs.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate from the blood six ounces, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong, double thread, of silk, or of braided cord, so that putrefaction does not quickly occur in the wound before it consolidates, and that a flow of blood may not occur.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut the excess that is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do it at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone, with a surgical cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in place of the same work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better work, unless if the sick person has a fever, or is of a hot disposition.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because cautery is from those things that help to end humidities.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better aid.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cotton, and pads made properly should be placed on it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution, treat it with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, meanwhile, while you are working, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hurry to cut it off with cautery, or to fill the place with zegi, and bind your hand tightly until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those are present for you, then place your finger on the area, until the blood coagulates.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And embrocate the area with water of intense cold, until the sharpness subsides, and it is bound as required.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is easier and less troublesome than extracting the artery, it is to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades: and the sharpness of the two blades should be like an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are of much less sharpness than two blades.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp, like two blades, the cold rushes to both [blades]: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this, therefore, the work is better than any other work, and easier, and more readily done.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with ink: and place both [blades] intensely hot, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between its extremities may be elongated.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Concerning the treatment of persistent acute lacrimal discharge from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter Four.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are persistent, and their flow is from veins situated above the external skull: and no medicinal treatment with medicines avails them, and you see the face of the sick person already flushed, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their eyelashes are already corroded with the corrosion: and his eyelids are heated from the intensity of the tears: then the ancients required this operation for their treatment, and they named that treatment, with the Sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is, that you should instruct the sick person to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equally spaced incisions along the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be about two fingers, and one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the length a little from the movement of the temples, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are on the two sides: and move your hand away from the joining of the two jawbones, and let the space of each incision be the amount of three joined fingers: and let you have a piece of prepared sponge, or many dried cloths, with which you dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a probe with two sharp ends, whose following form is this.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is on the temple side, up to the second incision: and scrape off with it all the skin, which is between the two incisions, with the sifac, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this probe, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, called a sharp scalpel, with one side smooth, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and drive it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels, which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after a quantity of blood has run, express the places from the clots of congealed blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every fissure a linen cloth from old cotton, and place over them cushions soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer much infusion with lukewarm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with basil ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated: until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the treatment of acute tears and cataracts in the eyes from interior parts of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs befall someone; and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their appearance already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, painful, injuring pain deep within the head, and a consequent sneezing: then from these occurrences, know that those matters and catarrhs do not come, except from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is that you should order the sick person to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or another slightly across its width, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be right up to the bone: and you must pull your hand away from the temporal muscles, which move during chewing: until when the bone is exposed: and you shall dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with old cloth, or with linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind above with poultices: and soak the poultices with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it, and see that the hot abscess is already lessening: then it is necessary that you rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow: such as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony: and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpea and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water and vinegar, and things like them; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	Therefore, when a stone, or a type of stone from those which are not added or grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you see a stone, then instill into the ear something of violet oil, or sesame oil.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer its extraction, and cause sneezing with condiments, and close the nostrils at the time of the sneeze, after you place in a circle around the ear pieces of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For often it departs with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If however it does not depart, then administer its extraction with instruments, that is, with small tweezers; whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it departs with the instruments, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine, single-hooked, thin instrument.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not depart through that, then make a tube of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole very far, and seal that which is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no passage to the wind except through the tube; then extract with your wind by a strong suction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For often it departs with that which we have narrated.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If however it does not depart in this way, then take a small amount of helkalimbat, or of viscous, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, and place it on the end of the probe after you have carefully wrapped a bandage around it: then introduce it into the ear hole with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not depart with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incision, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of incision is, that a leeches be applied first to the cephalic vein: and extract from it blood according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, near his fat in the depressed area there: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever instruments you can.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then stitch the incision from your hour with speed, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the thing falling into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, it does not yield to you to exit, then take a thin, slender spatula, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer it with that to cut out that type of grain that falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that grain has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it into many fragments: then extract them with hooks, or with a fine tweezers, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is thus relieved.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	However, in the water that enters the ear, it is necessary that the weak person use sneezing with condiments first; and now he has filled his ear with some old cotton; and he lies on that ear in which the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it exits through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire for a short time, and let the weak person insert one of them into the hole of his ear: and let him jump on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone on the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, let him not cease doing that with stone and stone, until all the water exits.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water exits in such a way that you take one from papyrus, or from reed, and insert one end of it into the ear; and light the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat with another reed, and do this many times, until all the water exits: and extract it with a cannula according to what was stated before concerning the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extracting an animal entering it, if it is of small body, like a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all those which are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to examine the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the shape, narrow at the bottom, wide at the top; and introduce the slender end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates it; then suck with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times, until all the worms emerge.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If, however, they do not obey you for exit, then coat the surrounding area of the cannula with wax, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, they do not emerge with what we have said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have already used in the killing of worms, and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring of oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, the form of which is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it from silver or bronze, narrowed at the bottom, in which there is a small hole, wider at the top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let the impelling thing that is in the concavity of the cannula be made of bronze, properly made.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap linen around its end with a proper wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you desire into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then introduce the rod with the linen from above, and squeeze it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is driven into the cavity of the hearing, and the sick person feels it inside; and whatever is poured into the ear should be warmed with fire for a short time; and beware lest the distilled substance be excessively cold, for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Concerning the treatment of sudden ear blockage.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it happens also to some people that blockage in the ear canal comes from a wound or flesh growing in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear cavity, where sight does not reach it; and sometimes it happens near the outer part of the cavity, and sight follows it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which the sight does not encompass, is in many cases difficult to cure.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which is followed by sight, you must place the patient's ear in the sun and look at it.  Then if you see the blockage appearing, open it with a thin probe, whose form is as follows, having a small, slightly pointed width at one end, and the rest of the probe smooth-sided, so as not to injure the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the blockage is from flesh grown in the ear canal, then grasp it with a thin hook and cut it away forcefully, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod, and heat it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If, therefore, you sense a blockage with the patient experiencing hearing difficulty, attempt to open it gently, and beware of injuring the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place a bandage, according to the size of the opening you have made, and wrap it in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days, until you are certain the wound is healing.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a bandage, soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle ground zegi powder on it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see that the ear is already suppurating, then you must remove the bandage and replace it with another bandage wrapped in a caerota made from rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides; then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, bleeding occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, and place it on the ear; and use the remaining treatment, which stops the bleeding, as described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Concerning the treatment of ulcers of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These ulcers that occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore it is necessary to grasp them with forceps, or with a hook, and to cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then apply a crushed lapis to the affected area.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lenticular cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Concerning the treatment of granulations of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often something happens in the eyelids that is similar to granulation in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called granulation: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore, the operation on them is that you should consider then, if it is granulation proceeding from that which appears of the eyelid, and moves to every part, and its matter is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, make a fissure upon it across its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from every side with ease, until it escapes.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	However, if its excision is not prepared for you unless after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision for a short time, then that harms the sick person in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the fissure is large, then gather it with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and makes it flesh again.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the granulation is sloping towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the granulation with a hook; besides which, you need an incision, and press it from every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is prolonged by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the granulation with salt water, and treat the place with that which makes flesh, until the sick person is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Concerning the treatment of the ailment of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the tunics of the upper eyelid, and it happens most often in children.  It weighs down their eyes, and they suffer from catarrhs in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight, because tears flow quickly to them.  Because of this, you see them always lying on their faces, and they sleep on them. Their eyelids, now covered by swelling, are moist beneath their eyebrows.  And the prominent Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its operation is that the sick person should place their head in your bosom.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare a bandage on it, and make a circle from that bandage according to the size that encompasses the Axirnath from every side.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it over it, and press with your fingers from every side, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then make a slit in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, going through the width, and let the slit not be larger than that made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you pierce the entire skin, until you reach the Axirnath, for in many arrangements the Axirnath proceeds from the slit according to the shape of a piece of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore, pull it out with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers to the outside; and you will turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed; and beware, lest you add to the slit, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet, and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	However, if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the slit, you will add a little to the slit with ease, until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are men who rub salt, and put it in the concavity of the fissure, so that the moisture remaining from it may liquefy.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however a hot abscess occurs in the place, then treat it with sedative plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the methods of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, causing it to wrinkle improperly.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When extra hairs grow in the eyelids, beyond the natural course of hairs, and they multiply, they harm the eye and cause ailments, such as constant weeping, softening of the eyelids, and clouding, until it becomes a cause of the eye's destruction.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed cured according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, according to what was said previously in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suturing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by canes, according to what I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce a needle into it, in which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and cause the needle with the thread to penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a radius.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid beneath the hairs, adding a spatula incident from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton, or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with ink, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that it be shaped according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since it is already diversified in humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For among them is one who needs a large amount to be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, with the spatula, make an incision along the two lines that you marked, beginning at the larger tear duct and continuing to the smaller tear duct.  Let the incision be close to the natural hairs, as thick as a ray.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert a hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape it all away.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together the two lips with a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and fasten any excess thread to the two eyebrows, with certain disguising substances, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads for up to three or four days; afterwards, treat it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and treat it with something that dries and constricts it.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised by sealing the wound and bringing it together; but it will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancients taught this method of treatment.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is care for the weak person in it, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate hooks, or gathered together, according to this following form, then cut what is superfluous with small shears, according to this form, with equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal to it: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and gather together the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand with equal elevation; and raise the skin upon which the marked area is, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture; and treat it until it is healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If however an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with a cauter, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that its hairs are turned.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore it is necessary that you use in it what we said about the incision: but suture is more artificial for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with canes.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure that is within, according to what I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then, skillfully make two canes, or two slender pieces of wood, whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a spatula: and you have already incised at the extremities of each, from both sides, where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then carefully attach each to the excess of the eyelid, and tightly tie the two canes from both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the tightened skin will die, and turn black, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two canes, which you shall make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Concerning the raising of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in that is, that you take a thin needle, and introduce into it a fine, soft silk thread.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather its ends, and tie each end with a very small knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then place another fine thread beneath it in the Alinxotati, and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the sick person place his head in your lap, and be close to the light so that the operation is clear: because it is a delicate, or small, operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up above the alinxotati: and introduce into the alinxotati that hair: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the alinxotati from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	However, if the alinxotati is pulled out, and the hair does not come out with it: pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you have placed in it, until the alinxotati comes out from the upper opening, and you see it with the eye's vision: then you shall pull the alinxotati and the thread: and remove both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If however the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and lift it with it: or leave it, until it lengthens after a time, and then lift it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati occurring in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatrati occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental therefore results from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to them.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of treatment in it is that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and place in that which is between them a linen bandage, and tie it, until it is healed.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And you should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather, use in it things that soften, such as fenugreek: and embrocate with water, in which has been cooked marshmallow, flaxseed: and with the unguent dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some of the oils: and wrap with it a bandage, and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you should strive with all your ingenuity to prevent its consolidation, according to the form it had in the first place.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described is, in fact, merely a rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the shape of the area does not return to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which occurs below, is the one truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one is caused by a wound, or a fissure, or a cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation in it is to take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and to dip it into the flesh, and to make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the flesh at both ends.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the eyelid's shape returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a ray, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and a corner is made from them: until when they come together, their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separated parts: sew it with wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, of softening medicines, and bandages, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a cataract occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the treatment of a cataract, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the cataract.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For indeed there are many varieties in form; and a skillful craftsman prepares a method in whatever way is possible for him, until he restores the shape to the natural form, or nearly so, and himself, the affected part, according to what is appropriate to it from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this adhesion occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you should insert the end of a probe under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp, but slightly blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed and damages the eye with its sharpness; and your incision should be like scraping away the adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then, pour salty water into the eye, washing it with water; or distil it from a vessel made of lead, dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then, separate the eyelid and eye with linen; and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after three days use lead and consolidants, until healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Concerning the incision of the toenail and the fleshy prominence of the tear ducts.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the toenail is according to two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and it is similar to hard, subtle sifac.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is severed, and the hook does not fix itself to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types do not begin, unless from the larger tear duct, until it goes gradually, until it covers the sight, and hinders the light, and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation in its incision is: that the sick person should place his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the nail with a hook of few foldings, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, or ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair, until its last part.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear-duct flesh, so that no constant flow of tears may occur from its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, which has this form.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful that the spatula does not touch the horny tunic, and that a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, put some crushed salt into the eye, or a preparation made from ziniar, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is treated many times with medicines, and is healed as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye, and take a thin, gentle, and weakly pointed spatula, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the nail from above with precision.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it thins and breaks, and the shaving imprints on it, then distil from your hour glass a solution made from ziniar, or from red sief, or crushed salt: and poultice the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation on it until the whole of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye, in which case leave it, and treat the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with a razor, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	If, however, a fleshy prominence of the tear duct is harmful to the eye with great injury, it should be suspended with a hook and a portion of it cut away: and do not make the incision too deep, so that the flow of tears is not obstructed.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then instill into the tear duct a red ointment, or one made from ziniari, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh grown in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes red flesh grows in some people's eyes, either composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil or comes close to it or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it resembles a rose-hip.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the treatment in it is also that the sick person should place their head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open their eyes, and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks: and hold it with a single forceps, or tongs.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh in the first place, until the whole of it is finished with the scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful of the eye, so that you do not harm it during the operation; and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a scalpel, as we described in the incision of the hoof; or with small scissors, with which the asebel is gathered, according to its form, as it will appear after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your incision is complete, and the entire alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or distill into it red powder, and similar corrosives from the medicines; and place over the eye externally a cloth with egg white; so that it is protected from a hot abscess.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If anything of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye, and treat it with that which quiets the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do likewise with the added flesh that occurs in the eye from this type.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary to avoid treating any weak eye by a natural or accidental way, operating with iron; and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that that member is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are red veins woven over the eye, and they hinder the eye's function of sight; and they weaken the eye with the length of the days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye in which the Sebel is present is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides the Sebel; then collect its Sebel.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is, that you should instruct the sick person to place his head in your bosom.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be a thin double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded on one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with fine scissors with care, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and are dissolved; and beware lest you injure the eye with the extremities of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the midday sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then instill into the eye a green or red sief, so that its sharpness may corrode what remains of the sebil.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	However, if it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the eye's pain, and leave it for a few days until its pain subsides and is secure from a hot abscess; then repeat upon it according to the same method until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Concerning the reduction of a fractured nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call a fractured nose a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharp burning medicine, according to the preceding account of it.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no remedy for it, except to pierce above the abscess at its origin, and to extract all the moisture and pus from it, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness on it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called a rough head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made from tempered iron, and let its head be round like a hazelnut, pointed with a file, or with a fine aliskilfer point; and place it upon the corrupted spot of bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with drying astringent medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not become an abscess, and no accident occurs in it; then know that it is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril's opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, so that you expose the second bone with an iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron tip be triangular; and its wood be a pyramid tapering to the tip, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on the bone itself; and let it be near the tear duct; and move your hand slightly away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the sick person feels it; through this that he finds air coming out from it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh grows, and the place hardens, then the matter that was discharged to the exterior returns to the nose; therefore it is less burdensome upon the sick person.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	Of the reduction of the prominent eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes completely, and no harm occurs to the sight, nor any diminution, then you should release the patient; then bleed him; afterwards place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the eye a liniment made from acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye from above with a plaster and many bandages.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the bandages is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth is doubled over four times; make many of these; then place them one over the other, according to the amount needed for the eye; then bind over them with a hard cloth with strong constriction.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again use cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If however the bandage softens again, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly; then remove the bandage after one day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye already restored to the integrity of the tunic, it is good; and if not, then again apply the plaster, and bandages, and constriction, and cupping glasses, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Concerning the incision of the tunic.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the eye's tunic, then it protrudes and comes forth outside the eyelids like a grain of the eye, and the man's appearance is disfigured because of it, and one wishes to cut it; then the operation is as follows, as I relate: to insert a needle into the root of the eye from the lower part to the upper.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another needle, on which is a double thread from the tear duct side, and let it penetrate; and leave the first needle in its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and bind with it the part of the eye around the needle; and tightly tighten it.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then withdraw the needle, and place on the eye wool soaked in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread comes away with the eye.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with whatever strengthens it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the eye is tightened on all sides with a bandage of cloth, until the eye gains great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a fine probe that reaches the depth of the eye, and the white fluid runs out, and the eye descends, and immediately enters: then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease, called Alcomnat, is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not the eye itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of treatment in it is that you make the sick person sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it until you see the pus descend to the lower part of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then let it be fixed, and do not let it descend, and let the light be released: and let the sick person see things as he saw them before: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spatula and split with it above the horny membrane a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, at the crown, until pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Concerning the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already discussed the kinds of water in division, and what is suitable for piercing, the speech declaring and explaining; then take that same one according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then therefore it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye, and tie it tightly; then with your right hand, the eyelid of his eye in which the water is, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand an almond, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the almond near the crown, by the thickness of a ray, in the apparent white of the lesser tearful eye; then drive the almond with force; and you revolve your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye; and you feel that the almond has now reached the empty thing.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the almond's journey to the depth be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see it in the very pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almond to the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it lower, one time after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that on which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then place it down a second time, except that the almond emerges.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend, then extract the almond with ease, and you will turn your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve some clear gem salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place the entire wad of lint, or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, over the eye, and bandage the sound eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, and those of our time, place crushed cumin with egg white on it.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the almond does not yield to you for entry into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from humans whose eye is very hard, then it is necessary to take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, scrape it with it only the conjunctiva, and do not insert your hand into the aperture; and there is nothing but to make a subtle path for the almond's place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almond, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient a suitably constructed sleeping place, in which he shall sleep on his back in a darkened room; and prohibit him from all movement, and from coughing; and place before him food that will soothe his nature; and do not allow him to move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage remain according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that darkened room, and test his sight; and have him look at objects.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary that he do it at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it is necessary to delay it; because water ascends quickly through violent sight.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh day, and to treat it with that which assuages the abscess, until it is calmed; then unbind his sight and place upon his face an oral remedy that controls his sight for a few days, having him remain in that darkened room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him gradually leave the house, and go about his affairs.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in a zalia a student is not excused from a sight several times; then indeed he may dare on the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed one of those from Alayrach has come to us, who said that in Alayrach a perforated magdan was made, from which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	However, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that, nor have I read of it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the species from the magdan, so that one who is ignorant of them may stand upon it.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made properly of bronze; and let their extremities be triangular with the same subtlety, and pointed.
Formae magda.	Forms of the magdan.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Concerning the treatment of flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter Twenty-Four.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes diverse growths of flesh are born in the nose, some of which resemble a scorpion with many feet; and from this there is cancerous, stony flesh, of a dark colour; and from this there is soft flesh, not of a dark colour.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, in the case of the soft flesh among these growths, not deceitful nor cancerous, you should have the sick person sit between your hands facing the ground, and open their nostrils, and insert a hook into the flesh; then draw it outward, and cut what you have grasped from it with a fine sharp scalpel on one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains from it, whose removal is not possible, then scrape it with one of the fine instruments with ease, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood prevails, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it until the blood is severed and all the flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then, after the incision, vinegar, and water, or wine, should be placed into the nose.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose opens, and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is now healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, the moisture does not penetrate, as it should, then know that within it is flesh grown on the upper nasal bones, to which the instrument did not reach during the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then, therefore, it is necessary that you insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place a finger's width, or less, between each knot.  And let the sick man, with a rod or whatever he can, bring one end of the thread into his nose, having made it like a [certain] shape. And pull on his thread until it reaches the [affected] mass, and emerges at his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times children in schools make something similar to this [using] atoms; and it is an easy thing for him who wishes.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that emerges from the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then cut away the flesh with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do that until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread; and after cleansing the blood, place in the nose a compress soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment has corroded all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place a lead cannula at the end of the object in the nose, for several days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it needs a treatment that will dry it, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a nasal douching, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze: that it should be like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish, make a closed cannula, like a pipe.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for nasal douching should be full, uncovered; with a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish from juices and fluid substances.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Concerning the treatment of nasal warts.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often a wart is born on the tip of the nose, and it grows larger and increases with the days until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, you should cauterize it and eradicate all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place over the site either a cautery or a burning medicine that stands in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If, therefore, its incision is delayed until it becomes enlarged, then consider, if it is stony, hard, of a dark colour, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For many times I have seen that whoever incises such an abscess, and great harm comes upon the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the diseased part, and incise it without fear, without anxiety: and treat the site with that which dries and constricts it, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Concerning the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little benefit comes from treatment, except in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then assemble the wound's edges with sutures; then treat it until it is healed.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the separated lips of the discontinuity are now each part whole, then you must scrape away every part from its apparent skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then, assemble the two edges with sutures, and tighten them, and powder the blood of a dragon, and crushed frankincense, over it; and place a piece of a diafinicon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters, upon the powders; and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then unbind it, and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads separate by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suture is, that you assemble the discontinuity either with needles, as we have described in the suture of the belly; or assemble the discontinuity with thread, as I have caused you to know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Concerning the extraction of lip nodules.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many men frequently have hard abscesses resembling grains of herbs on the interior of their lips; and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary that you turn the lip, and cut over every nodule on it, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it away from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then you should fill the place after the incision with bruised zegi until the blood is cut off.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place, where there is astringency, should be treated with it until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Concerning the incision of fleshy growth on the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often fleshy growth grows on the gums, which the ancients call abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you should suspend it with a hook; or hold it with forceps, and cut it near its root, and allow the pus, or blood, to run.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on the area ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Concerning the extraction of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes rough, unsightly, and sometimes blackened, yellowish, or greenish scabs gather on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer sides, and between the gums, until that corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become unsightly because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should have the patient sit between your hands, with their head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth, where the scabs, like sand, appear, until none of them remain; and similarly deal with blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other such things until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If, therefore, that which is on them from the beginning of the scraping is removed, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another, second, and third day, until finally the desired result is achieved.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes and forms, according to what is prepared for your operation; therefore, the scraper with which a tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the scraper used for scraping between the teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And let these shapes of scrapers be prepared by you, as you see them.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Concerning the extraction of toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter Thirty.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You ought to treat the tooth from its pain with all ingenuity, and delay in its eradication.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing to replace it when it is eradicated; because it is a superior substance.  Until, when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary when the infirm is compelled to eradicate it, that it may be strengthened, and that the aching tooth may be certified by you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For pain often deceives the infirm, and they think that it is in the tooth's substance and eradicate it; afterwards the pain does not recede, until the infirm's tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certified by you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side; then move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps at first gently, until you break it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and place the patient's head between your knees: which you have already held firmly, so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not emerge, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from every side with ease, and try its movement, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth; and bind it with the end of a thin radius, so that it does not break in the moment of your constriction upon it with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you act skillfully with the scarification around the gum from every side very much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And maintain your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person from that malice which is greater pain than his first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and their boldness over its eradication, beyond what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For very often they cause great illnesses upon men, which are more difficult to break, and the roots of it all remain, or some of them; or to extract it with some of the jawbones; as we have testified many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be washed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If a flow of blood occurs from those places (for it often does), then rub some of the zegi and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if zegi does not help you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of the fine forceps with which the tooth is initially moved should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick, so that they do not double when pressed upon the tooth.  They should be like those with thick handles, such that when you tighten them, they do not give way, nor double; with short extremities, and made of tempered iron, or well-made steel, with straight extremities.  And on their extremities be teeth, some entering into others, and tightening with a proper, strong constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the extremities are made like the shape of the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When, during the extraction of a tooth, a piece remains, then it is necessary to apply a poultice with butter for one or two days, until the area softens.  Then introduce the forceps, or pliers, whose extremities resemble the beak of the bird called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of these pliers is...
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities should be made like a file within; or like an aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If, therefore, it does not yield to removal with these pliers, then it is necessary to carefully expose the root and remove all flesh, and introduce the instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it be short, somewhat thick: and let it not be soaked, lest it break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If, therefore, the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with other instruments, whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first is triangular with a certain thickness at the extremity.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of a triangular, slender extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also aided by this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the treatment of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also, there is assistance with this instrument, which resembles a large hook, of this form: triangular extremity twisted, where there is some thickness so that it does not break; and it should not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many instruments for teeth, and likewise other instruments are not to be counted, and a skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument according to which the operation and the illnesses themselves indicate to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not describe an instrument, due to the diversity of their types.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, a bone breaks from the jaw or from other bones of the mouth, or if it rots, then probe over it in its place with what is appropriate for it from the instruments and forceps that I have mentioned in the extraction of roots, and assist with forceps, whose shape is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone is gripped or held with it, and does not escape and move away until the bone comes out; and restore the place with suitable medicines for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, there is a small rot in the bone, then scrape it of its rot, and treat it until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the filing of teeth that project over others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth project not according to their natural course, an ugly shape is made by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those who are available.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is therefore necessary that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth and is not positioned properly, or its filing or grinding is not possible, then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose shape is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision, by which you cut it, be in many days, and because of the tooth's hardness, and so that another tooth is not moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however it is prominent, exposed to its grinding: then grind it with a file of tempered steel, whose shape is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let the whole be of tempered steel, and its handle of small, fine points, like the file with which needles are made: with which the tooth is ground gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then smooth it, finally scrape it with some scrapers.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If, however, it is a tooth from which a piece has broken off, and it injures the tongue: then it is necessary to file it also, until the roughness of that break is removed, and it is made even: and flattened, and it does not injure the tongue, nor impair speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Concerning the retention of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth suffer concussion and displacement from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on it without it falling out, and you have treated them with astringent remedies, and the treatment has not been successful, then the remedy is to bind them with a gold wire, because silver turns green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be medium in thinness and thickness according to the amount that it will take between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the method of retention is to take a wire, and insert twice its length between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the wire between the loosened teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weaving to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving to the part from which you began; and bind your hand with care and skill until it is completely fixed; and let your tightening of the wire be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors; and bring both together, and shape them with pliers; and conceal them between the healthy tooth and the loosened tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it be so tight that it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it loosens or cuts, tighten them with another wire, and it will stay with it throughout this time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the method for teeth, and the manner of retaining two healthy teeth, and two loosened teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one tooth, or two, returns after the fall of each to its place, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and only a skillful, prudent, and experienced craftsman can accomplish this.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes some of the vaccini bones are adapted; and it is made like the form of a tooth, and placed in the place from which the tooth is strengthened and tightened, as we said; and it remains, and is preserved with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue and hinders speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-four.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a human being is born, or accidental, from a wound which has already become consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is that you open the patient's mouth at his head in your lap, and raise his tongue; then cut that nervous ligament across, until the tongue is released from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is anything hard and knotted in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound, then insert a hook into it, and split it across, until you cut the ligament, and the knot is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be careful, lest there be a fissure deep in the flesh, and you cut an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wash the area of the incision with rosewater, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen bandage under the tongue, which the patient must hold all night, so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then place ground zegi over the area.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a lentil-shaped cautery, suitable for it; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Concerning the extraction of a Ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural function, and perhaps it magnifies so much that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in it is that you open the mouth of the sick person before the sun, and consider the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, to which the sick person finds no sensation: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then throw a hook into it, and cut it with a thin spatula, and free it from every side.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place crushed zegi upon it until the blood is stemmed; then return to your operation until you extract it with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be washed with vinegar and salt, and treat it with the appropriate further treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there are occurrences between the throat and the glands, which resemble algodad, occurring externally, and are called the two tonsils.  When you treat them with what we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore it is a hard abscess, of a dark color, with little feeling, then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a reddish color, and its root is thick, then do not touch it with iron either, fearing a flow of blood, rather, leave it alone until it ripens.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then you will either perforate it, or it will burst on its own.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and its root is fine, then it is necessary to cut it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is, that you consider before its operation, if its abscess has rested completely, cooled, or diminished by some diminution; then therefore make the infirm person sit in the sun, and his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let the servant take between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or of bronze, which is as thin as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	Therefore, when you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it, then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as you can, besides pulling out with it some of the membranes.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, whose form follows this.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is like shears; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other sharply; therefore, take care that it is made of tempered iron, or imbued with alfuled.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is this.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	One side should be sharp, the other side not sharp.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then, after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled; or the leaves of myrtle, and things similar to those from astringents, until the flow of blood is stopped; then treat him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, cut it according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself have already treated a woman from an abscess which had arisen between her throat, which was drawing to blackness, few sensations, which had nearly closed her throat; and the woman was breathing from a constricted passage, and I had already forbidden her eating and drinking water; and she had already reached death, if it had remained for one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had emitted two branches, until they had emerged above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	Therefore, I hastened quickly, and I fixed a hook in one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it, where I grasped it from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same to that which proceeded from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterward I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut off a part of it, and only a little blood ran from it.  Therefore, the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then ate food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore, I did not cease cutting from that abscess for a long time; and the abscess succeeded in the place of that which I was cutting, until it was excessively prolonged with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore, I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore, it stood from the addition; then I departed from that place, and did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Concerning the incision of the abscess of the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes abscessed, and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the abscess, hot, has ceased from it, and is subtle; then it is necessary that you incise it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which is gathered from it, round, and has no length, and is bloody, or of a brown color, or black, and has no sensation: then it is necessary that you avoid its incision.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in it is fear over the sick person.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner which I have said, from its whiteness and length, you should make the sick person sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument, of which the narration has preceded; then fix the hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards; and incise it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not incise from it, unless that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you incise from it more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use that which we have narrated in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If, however, the sick person is terrified by the incision, then it is necessary that you employ skill in cauterizing it without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of the cautery on it is not except with sharp water; and it is that you place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and make with it an unquenched lime, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, which has this form.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be, like the concavity of a spoon's radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself; and let the sick person lie on his side, so that saliva may run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it into his throat and harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you shall keep it upon the uvula for a quantity of half an hour, until you see it already blackened and the biting of the medicine quieted.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a poultice, and wrap it about the extremity of the radius, and infuse the poultice with the medicine, and introduce the radius with the poultice into the cannula from above, until the poultice adheres to the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do it many times, until you achieve what you wish of cauterization of the uvula.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it: for it will dry and fall after three, or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe the circumference of the uvula with a poultice soaked in butter, and cleanse with that which is around it from the medicine; and wash it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And treat it externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This kind of treatment is therefore healthier than incision and farther from danger.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the uvula is treated even with something finer than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take mint, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs from them: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and steep them in vinegar, and boil them: and let the pot be plastered with suitable clay: and there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which the concave instrument is placed, in this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver, or of bronze: and let the end, in which is the pomegranate, be inserted into the patient's mouth, until the vapor ascends to the uvula above the cannula, until the uvula is greatly darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeatedly over it, until it dries.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's arrival.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it usually adds to the abscess: and it is not necessary that you do that, except at the decline of its hot abscess.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If however this instrument is not present to you, then take a reed, and place on its end the rind of an egg: so that the patient's mouth is not burned: because the rind of an egg prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is a good treatment with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter Thirty-Eight.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, it is necessary to extract that which is apparent from them, upon which the sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the sun, and it is made clear to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And that which is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the vomiting weak before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For perhaps the attached thing will come out by vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or a small piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge, and tie it to a thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it reaches the place where the spines or bone are, and it is drawn out, then it goes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a reed a little, and at its extremity let there be a curve, which he should insert into his throat with ease; and let him have his head raised up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest a cough befall him, and let him push with it a bone or spine, or let the physician insert it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But that which the sick person inserts is better, because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing; and let him push downward, or pull his hand upward with the instrument, the whole of it according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it emerges.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is medicated with what I have said in the division on treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick person in front of the sun, or in the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with delicate slender forceps.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them, then take a concave cannula, and insert it into the throat of the sick person until near the throat; then insert into the concavity of the cannula a heated iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times; and let the sick person abstain from water the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If, however, it does not exit with what we have described, then fumigate the sick person with lice, or with asa, with the instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, for it will fall itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which are live prunes with fire; and the pot is covered with a cover, in whose middle is a hole; and the extremity of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then, project the fumigation, and let the sick person place his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, it is necessary that it depart with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is drawn out from the throat, when it falls upon it as seen.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: unless because it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is similar to the mouth of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and their general care.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of various types, according to the recollection of them, that is to say, one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation, and incision from two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is from the type of abscess in itself, and because it is comprised of humors.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second way is because of the places in which it occurs in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy area is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of abscesses, there are some which should not be punctured, unless after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion; and of them there are some which should be punctured while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as abscesses which are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because an abscess, when it occurs near a joint, and its duration extends until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; therefore, it is a more proximate cause of the contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a main limb; for if you delay its incision until it matures, it will harm either that limb or the main limb through it.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus; therefore, incise it unripe; and it is not necessary to incise an unripe abscess, not of complete digestion, except for one near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become incurable at its end.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary to know the time of incision of a mature abscess, according to its completion: and it is through the calming of pain, the recession of fever, the diminishing of redness, and pulsation, and the sharpness of the abscess's head; and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same incision in the lower place of the abscess, and of more prominent eminence: and let the incision be directed longitudinally along the body, if the abscesses are in the hands and feet, and the places of tendons, and chords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that are reflected, proceed with the incision according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	However, when the abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better to leave its incision until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to its completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you incise it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much dirt and filth, and perhaps its edges and depth become hardened.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are incised across the body at need, or according to the limb that requires it.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small incision in small abscesses, and a large incision in large abscesses, or multiple incisions similar in size to the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are some abscesses in which the skin must be hollowed out and incised when it has already become like a rag, and has reached a stage where it is already dead, like that which happens in many boils and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And some of them are incised with an incision having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from among them is that which is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from among them are some in which a round incision, and a lunate incision are administered, and similar incisions to these.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That which does not have a head, however, such as mild superficial abscesses, should be pierced with a superficial or merely a flat perforation.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, you should not be hasty and extract all the pus at that hour; rather, extract a part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then cover the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some more pus.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this repeatedly according to a gradual method, until it exits; especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an aged and decrepit person: for the animal spirit is often resolved by the exit of pus; and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the abscess wound is small, or is a flat incision, then apply bandages of linen, or old tow.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and the perforations' fissures are numerous, it is then necessary that you insert a bandage into every fissure, until they meet each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the abscess you have excised a part of the skin, or have hollowed it out around the edges, then it is necessary that you fill it with old tow, or as when cloth is woven, or the down of linen is shaved off without moisture, and bind it tightly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it, and treat it with whatever ointment is appropriate, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however, a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then apply cold water, and vinegar, after they are soaked into a cloth, and place it repeatedly on the site of the bleeding.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If, however, the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places in this book of ours, and by division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If, however, it is during the winter season, and the area of the abscess is densely innervated, then it is necessary that you insert cushions with hot wine and oil, and place them over the affected areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then it is necessary that you place cushions soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make it all cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when the third day shall come, as we have said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer the treatment appropriate for it, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how the way to its treatment is chaptered individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur in the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur in the scalp, and are of the type of Nodes, which are contained within tunics that are like sacs to them; as if they were the pouched crops of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their types are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some are fatty; and some contain moisture like mud; and some contain moisture like bran and gruel; and similar to these, and some are hard, stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And there is no fear in the incision and extraction of all of them, provided that their incision does not oppose an artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the procedure in their incision is to examine them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial longitudinal incision, according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with an incision from line b to line g. When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the container that holds the moisture, and do not leave anything from it at all.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns if anything remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the cotum in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remains from the container.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then again apply the cotum with Egyptian ointment a second, and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing has remained from the container; then treat the wound with the ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a fatty lump, then cut it according to this shape, the incision having the shape of a cross; and insert hooks between the two sides of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and try your skill in extracting the tissue that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, an artery resists you, then do that which I will tell you afterward.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in the abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in some people, in which there is not moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I cut upon an abscess in the head of an old woman, and found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if someone struck it with something to throw, they wounded it.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses, however, occurring in the head, apart from these abscesses which occur in the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation of them always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus may be relieved downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat it with whatever is suitable for them from the treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Concerning the incision of Whitlows on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And concerning those that occur in the neck, they are single, and multiple: and they are generated from one another: and every whitlow from them is within its own proper tunic, as is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the species of these whitlows are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from them are stony ones; and from them are those that contain humours; and from them are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, in that one among them which you see of good disposition to the touch, whose proximity to the skin colour is evident, and which moves to every part, and is not joined to the neck's nerves, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, nor is deep: you should separate it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b, to line, g, and scrape it from every side; and spread the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we said in the case of abscesses of the head, and pull it out gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is a precaution that the vein or nerve not be cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the scalpel not be overly sharp, so that it does not injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	However, if you cut a vein or artery, or it hinders you from the operation, then apply pounded zegi to the wound, or certain powders that stop bleeding, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound softens; or it starts and wants to become putrid.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For then the blood stops; therefore return to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then investigate with your index finger if anything remains of the other small scabs; therefore cut and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein in the root of the scab, then you must not cut that scab from its root; rather, you must tie it with a strong doubled thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old lint, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then treat it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire scab is cut, then you must bring together the two edges of the wound and suture it immediately, after you see that there is no longer any excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	However, if you see that excess remains because of the size of the scab, then you must strive to cut its root and remove it, and administer the suture which we have described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And whatever scabs contain moisture, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that the place of its maturity appears to you, and place the puncture from what follows below the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then after the puncture, apply liniments with ointment, and similar things, to corrode whatever remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound already cleansed, then treat it with a generative flesh ointment until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said this incision on the epiglottis, and I have seen no one in our land who has done it, and this is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those with synocha, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided, as it does not provide benefit because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, the incision of the epiglottis should be used, to avoid the harm that comes from suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do this, we should cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, making a small incision across, in the area between two circles, an incision that is in the sifac, not in the cartilage. This place is indeed suitable for the incision, because it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the physician is timid, then he should extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should split the skin until he reaches the canal, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the sifac we mentioned, and the incision of the canal is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it, with its rupture, and the severing of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for a time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the hour in which suffocation is feared has passed, bring together the two lips of the wound's skin, and sew it itself alone without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this account, which we have related, is not applicable unless they see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the patient's throat; and the patient has been raised above death, and his breath is about to cease: they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the patient may breathe over the wound with some respiration and be saved from death.  And on account of this, they prescribed to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is for three days, and as much as it is; then, therefore, they prescribed to sew the wound and to treat it until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw for myself is that a maid took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut a part of the lung channel with it.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to treat her, and I found her groaning, like the groan of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Therefore, I examined the wound and found a small amount of blood that had come out of the wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore, I believed that she had not cut a vein, nor an artery; and wind was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I hastened therefore, and treated her wound, until it was healthy; and nothing happened to the maid except hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her former state of health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the incision of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Concerning the incision of a hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess, called a hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly, in the natural one there is no ingenuity.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	Accidental, however, is in two ways: one of which is similar to fatty tumors.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is similar to an abscess that forms from the knotting of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is fear, and it is not appropriate that presumption be made toward it with iron, unless it is small; and you should test it and investigate it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If, therefore, you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any vein, then cut it, as tumors are cut, and extract it with what contains it from the cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then scrutinize its entire area.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with what is appropriate for treatment until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Concerning the incision upon the variety of Tumors.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of tumors, and I have already stated all their kinds in the division; and it is necessary for me to relate here the difference between a tumor and a fistula, since it is a cause of doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	Therefore, I say that when a fistula is present, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the superfluity subsides and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	However, with a tumor there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains them in a sort of bag or cyst, peculiar to them, and it is according to the color of the body.  And its beginning is like a chickpea, and it grows larger or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two kinds: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colours of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a tumor, you must examine it and investigate it first with an instrument called an Intromissum, according to its form, which will be shown in the chapter after this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of investigation of abscesses and all tumors is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most moist place you find in the abscess; and you roll your fingers with it slowly until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then place your hand at the end according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the Intromissum and consider what emerges in its wake.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore a running moisture emerges, whatever colour it may be, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I said in the other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture emerges in the wake of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty; therefore cut over it with an incision shaped like a cross, according to this form, as I taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and peel the skin from every side with ease; and keep the cyst if you can over it, so that you extract the healthy one with the tumor.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If however the cyst breaks open during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the healthy part, for this often happens, then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little or much remains of it, the tumor returns for the most part.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it overcomes you, and a little remains of it: then fill the wound at your completion with certain sharp corrosive powders; and constrict the wound, and place upon it what sits as a warm abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore the tumor is large, then suture its two lips, and treat it with that which causes it to heal.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein there, then hurry and fill the place with pounded zegi, and leave it constricted for two or three days, until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood ceases; then return to cutting what remains of the tumor.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning the instruments outside for section and perforation.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Among them are the forms of instruments for insertion, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	They should be made of iron, with square ends, well-finished, so that they quickly enter the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are forms of instruments, and, no, that is, piercing ones: and one of them is called a beris, that is, a piercer: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are suitable for investigating abscesses, and openings, and fistulae, and buboes from that which lies between the bones within them.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and gentle, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, made of gold, or brass, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those made of gold.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And there are also experiments made from black lead, which are suitable for testing fistulae, whose concavity has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their gentle reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because among them are long ones, among them medium ones, and among them short ones, according to the quantity of the fistula's breadth and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because among them are simple ones, namely those which have a single curve: and they are of three kinds, as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And among them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the shapes of knives, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: because among them is a large, medium, and small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their cutting edges are sharp, the other edges are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, unless so that they may help in the scraping of knots in fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the sick person may be healed by them, and find a little peace from the burning sensation he finds in scraping an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the large ones, and are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of bronze, and are similar to the instrument with which alcohol is made: and on the broad end a hidden spatula point is placed: and on it runs inward, and outward as you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shapes of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers when puncturing abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of bronze, or brass, round, a little in length, as you see: and let them be of fine workmanship.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these cupping glasses, large and small, be with you, so that you may cut off blood with speed when needed, and when medicine is not present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them to cut off blood on every part of the body, and use them only on fleshy parts, such as the thighs of the leg, and the hips, and the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groins, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes other small instruments are made from them, similar to hazelnuts, according to their shape, with which blood is cut off when it flows from a phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round in this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Concerning the care of men's breasts that resemble women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of some men become swollen at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to become soiled in sleep) until they resemble women's breasts, and remain foul-looking abscesses.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever abhors that, ought to cut above the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards, fill the wound with a flesh-forming medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the breast inclines downwards and softens because of its size, as happens in women, then it is necessary to cut it in two places on its upper sides with two incisions similar to a crescent shape, each of which is joined to the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards, scrape off the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not complete the incision that you ought to make, because of the patient's distress or because of blood flow, then you ought to fill the wound with a cloth soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Concerning the perforation of an abscess, which occurs under the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which occur under the nipple are of the nature of hard strophulae, some containing cysts, and some containing moist fluids.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those of them which contain moist fluids should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, according to this form, from line b to line g. When thus the entire matter from the abscess is evacuated, then fill it with old linen, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the linen should be removed, and treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the nature of knotted strophulae, then dissect upon it, as we said in the section on strophulae, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, the wound extends in this so as to emit pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said in what has been stated before.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Of the incision of an abscess that occurs because of the artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery bursts, and the skin over it is consolidated, then often an abscess results from it: and similarly, it also happens to the vein, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to the artery and vein are: because, when the abscess is due to the artery, it is long, gathered deep within the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound to it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to the vein is round on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And incision upon this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and the groin, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is also from them in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Upon that which is from them, from the swelling of the opening of the Artery, find in the skin a cut in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the cut with hooks, afterwards the Artery: and free it from its sheaths, until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a needle beneath it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the Artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two Arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the place, which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until the blood which is in it is all discharged, and the abscess is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a treatment that produces pus, until the ligatures fall off: afterwards treat it with suitable ointments, until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If the abscess is because of a cut in a Vein, then you should hold with your hand what you can of the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate, and have a double thread on it, until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the abscess with a good ligature; as I told you in the ligature of the grape, from two sides with two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the needle; press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in the middle of itself, until what is inside it comes out; then cut off the excess skin, and leave what is bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place over it the poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment, which is done with plasters and ointments, until it is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning the abscess which occurs from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, so too an abscess occurs in the nerves: which occurs in them through a blow, or occurs from excessive exertion, and similar things: and it happens most often in those places of assistance, or the heel, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is squeezed with force, the infirm person feels a sensation similar to numbness in it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a deep-seated abscess within the body, rather it is beneath the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forward, or before, nor backward to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be treated with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps a contraction will result.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that which is in the head or forehead, slit the skin with a lancet.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is a small abscess, then hold it with scissors and cut it away from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it: then remove it, and close the wound with sutures: and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Many people frequently have, in their bellies and other parts of their bodies, growths called Fungalia, by resemblance to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their root is slender, and their head is thick, and their edges are turned back.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And some of them are small; and some of them greatly enlarge.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I myself have seen a man in whose belly were two growths, which resembled fungi more than anything else; there was no difference between them—white, small root, and their edges turned back, and they were cleft, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore I cut them, and found in one the weight of approximately ten and eight ounces, and in the other approximately six ounces.  And the procedure for their incision is, if the patient is damp, and the color of the growth is white, moist, and slender-rooted; then cut it with a broad scalpel, and have cauteries ready in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled at its section; therefore hurry if blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see a patient fearful and timid of incision with iron, then take a well-made lead thread and bind it tightly to the growth;  using the method we described, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the lead binding.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease binding the lead, whenever it presses on the growth, until it is severed, and falls off by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the growth is large and rooted, then in its incision there is something of fear and dread, especially that which is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to cut it in half.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware that you do not presume to cut a growth that is dark in color, of little feeling, and foul in appearance: for it is indeed a cancerous abscess, and I shall come back with a discussion of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Concerning the treatment of the navel's prominence.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The navel's prominence arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures of the abdominal wall above, from which wind or intestines escape, as happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood flowing from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from constrained wind within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If, however, it is due to a fissure of the abdominal wall, and an expulsion of pus, then its color resembles the color of the body, and it is smooth, without pain, and appears in various locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the expulsion of an intestine, then its location is, with that which we have described, of a more diverse nature.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it is greatly magnified at the entrance of the bath and with strenuous exertion.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If, however, it is due to moisture, it is smooth, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is it contracted, nor is it added to.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If, however, it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears to be black on the side.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If, however, it is due to generated flesh, then the abscess is serious, large, hard, and fixed according to one amount.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If, however, it is due to windiness, then its touch is smooth.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is, that you should consider then, if the eminence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or windiness: then you must abstain from its cure.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in it is fear and terror, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If, however, the eminence of the navel is due to the intestine or zirb, then you must instruct the sick person to hold his breath and stand outstretched.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards, instruct him to lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround with a wide spatula the area around the navel, over the spot you marked with ink.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie him around firmly with thread, or with silk cord, a strong ligament: and let the knot of the ligament be tied tight.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find it already grasped by the ligament, then extract the tied part, and introduce the index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly; and if you find the adhesion, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however the artery or vein is contrary to you, then surround it greatly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and introduce into them two strong threads; and introduce the two needles into the circuit you have made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, making them penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the extended flesh rots; and it falls away by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with whatever ointment is appropriate, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the prominence of the navel is from flesh protruding in it, or from moisture, then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or moisture, that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with whatever consolidates the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Concerning the treatment of CANCER.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already discussed the division of the species of Cancer, and how there is a way to cure it with medicines, and caution to avoid causing an ulceration when treating it with iron; and we have discussed Cancer generated in the womb and the precautions for its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as Cancer in the nipples or the thigh, and similar parts of the body, by removing the entire diseased part, especially when it is small and beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	However, when it becomes old and large, you should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself could not cure anyone from it, nor did I see anyone before me who had achieved this.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is to proceed and to relieve the weak from black cholera sometimes.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then phlebotomize it if you find it with manifest fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he is placed with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw into the Cancer hooks that suit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to scrutiny, until nothing remains of its roots; and let blood run, and do not sever it quickly, rather squeeze the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instruments are possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein causes you opposition, then cauterize the vein until the blood is severed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Concerning the treatment of Dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already recounted in the division of the species of dropsy, and how the accumulation of water occurs; and the signs of each species, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites alone; and it is not applied with iron to the species of tympanitis; nor to the species of hyposarca at all; for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of tympanitis dropsy with medicines, and your treatment has not been successful, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if weakness has already overtaken the sick person, or there is another infirmity with him besides dropsy, such as if there is a cough with him, or looseness of the bowels, and things similar to these: then beware lest you treat him with iron, for there is fear of that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If, however, you see the sick person of vigorous strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone; and he is neither a child nor an old man; then the method of operation in him is that you raise the sick person standing between your hands, and a servant behind him presses his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a sharp-pointed spatula, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be of two sharp parts, long, and sharp at the extremity like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, let there be something of shortness in it gradually, so that you do not proceed with it in the operation all the way to the intestines, and harm him.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend the incision from the navel a distance of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubic bone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If however the generation of dropsy is because of disease of the liver, then let your incision be on the left side from the navel three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the whole skin with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and if you do, as if you were to scrape it; and let the amount scraped off be the quantity of a fingernail, or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce, if so, until the spatula reaches the empty space; and it is the space of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and introduce into the hole the instrument, which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula; it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished; to which at its lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side; and the end of it is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see; on its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it itself descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a medium quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour through the dissolution of his animal spirit; or a syncope occurs to him which is near death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the sick person signify to you, from the virtue of his pulse, and from his good condition.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Which is, because it is retained immediately on account of the skin that retains the opening which is over the sifac: of which I spoke, that you should pierce it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then again insert the instrument on the second day, if you see the sick person tolerating it; and also extract a small quantity from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until there remains little of the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	However, if you fear for the sick person, and you remove much from the water, then care for him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and the sun, and let him endure thirst; and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed; and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water, according to what I said in what preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the care of infants who are born in places where their urinary openings are not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its urethra is not perforated, or is a narrow opening, or is in the wrong place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when it is born, with a very fine Spatumili, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a fine leaden nail in the opening, and tie it; and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When, therefore, it wishes to urinate, it is removed, and it urinates.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then replace it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	However, he whose opening is constricted is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	However, those in whom the opening is in the wrong place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because, in those who are born with it, the opening is at the end of the penis: therefore, they cannot urinate forward until they raise the penis with their hand to the higher place.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is there generation for him, because the semen cannot reach the womb properly: and it is a very foul illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation in him is that the sick man be placed on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend his penis with your left hand by forceful extension, and cut off the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a pointed knife, or a sharp scalpel; as is the incision of a reed, or as you shave something, so that the middle of it comes to be similar to the head of the penis, and so that the opening falls in the middle as it should.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of the flow of blood in your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, apply to it whatever stops the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning what happens in the foreskin and the head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These affections of the penis often occur, and there is a prominence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it, one is malignant and another is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook and cut off, until you cleanse the whole thing.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place upon it a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it afterwards with the unguent diafinicon, until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If it is malignant, of foul colour, then you should apply a cautery to it after incising and scraping it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the Albather is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and part of it is inside the foreskin and part outside, then it is necessary to remove the Albather that is inside first, until it is consolidated, then treat the outside part; for when you treat them together, the foreskin is not safe from being pierced.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And they also occur in the testicles, and in the foreskin, blackness and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you must cauterize all that is already blackened and that is about to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply over it afterwards with honey that has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark and crushed and sifted herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cautery is helpful for two conditions simultaneously, namely for the flow of blood, and a wound when it is corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra so that the patient can urinate over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	However, in the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur unless the foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon it; and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess: therefore, it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to discern these things precisely, then it is necessary to scrape off something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	Because when the foreskin is thin, it is perhaps perforated quickly due to its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with astringent wine until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is proper to children, it is necessary that we mark it with a better operation, and a smoother path leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experiment.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	This is because I have found the majority of craftsmen and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and scissors, and using leeches and ligating with thread and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing than with scissors and ligation with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers, perhaps the upper layer is cut, and the lower layer remains; therefore, it is necessary to make an incision to cut the other, and future pain will result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with cleansing done by leeches, that is, digital, which the sewers use, the incision of the male member's extremity is not secured; because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron slips out and ruins your operation: and indeed the skin of a boy is of short nature, and often they are born in such a way that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, cleansing with shears, and tying with thread, has shown me a good test; because shears are proportional to the incision; because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a compression is made in a similar figure, encompassing the skin of the penis on all sides, with which error does not occur at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper method of the operation is, that you cause the boy, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, to realize that you do not do anything except tie a thread to his penis, and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then cause him to rejoice and be glad in every way possible to you, from that which his understanding receives.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not be seated; and hide the shears in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy sees neither them nor anything of the instruments at all.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his penis, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it of the impurities that collect upon it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, tie a second ligature a little lower.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold the lower ligature site with your index finger and thumb, with good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin quickly upward and pull out the rod's head.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then allow the blood to run slowly (for it is better) and place powder on top.  And over the powder, a cloth on which is spread the yolk of a boiled egg in rosewater, mixed with good fresh rose oil.  And leave it on top until another day.  And treat it with the remaining treatment until healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt and meeting, so that the nail's branch does not come out of them; and let the length of the two sharp points be equal to the length of the two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	An error, however, occurring in cleansing is: perhaps the inner skin is entirely or partially escaped at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, you should stretch it from your hour with your fingernail before the abscess of the place, and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	However, if three days have passed, and that which is under the rod remains swollen, abscessed: then leave it until the abscess subsides, and carefully remove it, and cut it according to what is prepared for you; and beware of the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore, treat it with that which consolidates a wound from the powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders; and if it is cut from the skin beyond measure, and extends to the upper parts, that will not harm it either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or formed flesh, and similar things to those which we have mentioned from the methods of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not discharged, and you see that its retention is due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary for him to be weak, bent over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be placed on his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the weak person restrain his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Thus, he is forced, with the neck of the bladder, towards the expulsion of the stone to the rear, wherefore the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe on the sick person, then it is necessary for you to administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave, like the quill of a bird's feather in slenderness, long in the likeness of one and a half palms; to which let there be a slender tube at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of the urine's exit through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie to its extremity wool, or tow, a good ligature; and introduce the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe; and cut with shears if any excess of wool remains, but introduce it into the tube with force, as a lever.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg; and make the sick person sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and its member with moist oils, and olive oil, and tepid water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the member with ease, until it reaches the root of the member.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it upwards from the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then propel the syringe within it, until it reaches the Bladder, and the sick person feels it has already arrived at the empty thing: and this is not done according to this order, except because the passage, in which it goes, is tortuous.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out, and cause the urine to run through the urinary pathway: and again syringe, and do not cease to do that, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is collected in it, and force is required to distil water and medicines into it: then be done with the instrument called Clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is indeed deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which that which propels it is situated, should be according to the amount that is sufficient for it without addition, until, when something is pulled with it, moisture is drawn out; and when it is propelled, it is expelled far away, in accordance with how the clepsydra throws naphtha, that is, Greek fire in naval battles.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore, when the force is to project the moisture into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the clepsydra into the moisture, and pull with that which propels it upwards, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its extremity into the tube, as we described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then propel the moisture with that which propels it; for that moisture will reach the bladder at once, so that the sick person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	A subtle form of clyster for injecting into the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass:  its head should be higher, like a small alcama, and below that a sinus into which a ligament should fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a ram's bladder, and place in it the moisture with which you wish to inject the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two sinuses with a strong ligature, using a doubled thread; and warm that moisture a little over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the end of the clyster into the tube, afterwards, grip your hand over the bladder with the moisture with a suitable constriction, until the sick person feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If, however, a bladder is not present, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it all around its circumference.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then assemble the circle, as an alembic is assembled; after you have placed in it what you want of moistures, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	Concerning the extraction of the Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of Stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have explained the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of each; and I have spoken of the stone in which manual operation and incision are necessary; and this is the stone that is properly generated in the bladder; and that which adheres to the urethra; and I am narrating this with clear explanation and brevity.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs is that the urine issues from the bladder like water in its fineness; and white sand appears in it, and the sick person rubs his urethra and suffers with it, and often hangs [himself] down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it rises and the anus protrudes in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure is easy in children, as long as they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in young people it is intermediate, in that which is between those [two]; and that of whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if small, the cure is the opposite of that.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore, when we come to the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will expel all the stool that is in their intestines; for it sometimes hinders the finding of the stone in the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick person be taken with their feet, and shaken, and moved downwards, so that the stone may descend to the depth of the bladder, or leap out of a high place sometimes.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then have him sit between your hands, prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the whole bladder may be sloping downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then quickly proceed with incision upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to wipe your index finger with the oil of your left hand, if the patient is a boy; or the middle finger if he is a full-grown youth; and to insert it into his anus, and search for the stone until it is beneath your finger; and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards against the place whose incision you desire; and command a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another servant to raise the testicles with his right hand upwards; and with his other hand, to draw back the skin which is beneath the testicles, in the part adjacent to the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the Spatumile, making an incision, whose shape is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And make an incision in the area between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left flank; and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, according to the amount that it is possible for the stone to exit through it not larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone near the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that if the stone has angles and edges, its exit becomes difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round, its exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, to the one that has angles and edges, add in the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not emerge thus, then it is necessary to devise something over it: either to string it over it with a carefully made instrument, whose tip is like the Moon, which strings over the stone and does not escape from it; or to introduce under it a subtle instrument with a curved tip.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If, however, you cannot over it, then enlarge the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If, however, anything from the blood overcomes you, cut it off with a zegi.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If, however, there is more than one stone, then drive the largest first into the bladder opening.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards, push the smaller one after that; and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut over it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For since it happens to the patient one of two things, either that he dies, or that a constant dripping of urine occurs to him; because the place is not completely consolidated.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion, until it emerges; or skillfully break it with scissors, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: that a hot abscess might settle.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then lay the sick person on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have therefore loosened it, embrocate the place with water and plenty of oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diafhinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however in the wound a hot abscess has been added, and corrosive things, and similar things: such as if the blood should congeal in the bladder, and the urine should be prohibited from it; and it is recognized by the issue of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore introduce your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply whatever is suitable for treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the hours of the entire treatment, that you bind the two hips, and gather, for the reason of the medicines which are placed upon the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If a small stone is in the urethra, and is fixed in it, and the exit of urine is hindered, then treat it with what I described previously before you reach the stage of incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For very often you will be spared incision through this treatment, for I have already proven it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is so that you take a perforator of iron, whose form is this, a triangular tip, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take thread, and tie the urethra with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into the urethra with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For then urine is immediately discharged.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the urethra.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it will break, and exit with the urine, and the sick person will be healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If however this treatment is not prepared for you, due to something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone in the urethra itself between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And a ligature of thread beneath the stone is not necessary, unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and another ligature above it, unless so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's expulsion, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.  And for that reason, it is necessary for you, when you tie the upper thread, to lift the skin upwards, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Concerning the extraction of a stone in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Little stone is generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	However, if a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is prohibited due to many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman well-knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the stone's location: wherefore it needs deep incision, and in that is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity provokes it, then it is necessary that you take a woman physician, well-knowing: and little is found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If truly you keep her private, then seek a chaste, subtle physician, and present a woman midwife well-taught in the matter of women, or a woman who indicates a part of the art in this skill: make her therefore present, and especially to her, that she do all that you command her from the inquiry about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First, that she look to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert her finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If, therefore, she finds it, she should constrict it under her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina of the sick woman, and inquire about the stone, after placing her left hand upon the bladder, and compressing it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If, therefore, she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength, until she reaches it with the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should cut upon it at the opposing midpoint of the vulva, at the root of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, constricting it underneath: and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then insert a rod over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If, therefore, she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone emerges from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that the types of stone are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its types, so that this may signify to you concerning that which you desire.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, therefore, blood conquers you, then add to the place ground zegi, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is cut off.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone emerges, and do so as to prepare yourself with the instruments, which I have said concerning the extraction of stone in men, so that you may be assisted by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If, however, a flow of blood conquers you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut: then put powder upon the place, and bind it with bandages fittingly tight: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When, therefore, the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On the sectioning of a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is not present unless there is an aggregation of moisture in a white sifac, which is beneath the skin containing the testicle and egg; and it is called a sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature prepared for it in part of the egg, until it becomes rotten; which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we said: and that does not occur except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And indeed the generation of this hernia is from weakness that occurs in the testicles; wherefore this matter is discharged to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it occurs from a blow upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colours.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For either its colour inclines to yellowness, or it is blood-red, or foul, black, or watery white, and there is that which is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white sifac that we have mentioned, then the abscess is round to a small length like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture surrounds it on every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in the proper pannicle to itself, then the abscess is round with a portion of an egg, and on account of this a man estimates that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the senses.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Therefore, when you want knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, the form of which preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Therefore, according to that which emerges in the trace of the Intromission, judge of that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	Therefore, when we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person that he be bled if it is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he will be laid upon his back upon a slightly elevated object, and place many cloths beneath him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left, and instruct the minister to sit on his right, who will extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, up to near the pubis; and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac encompassing it; and scrape it and observe, or beware from this, that you dissect it; and let your scraping, with which you scrape it, be from the part that hangs more with the egg; and subtly examine it with the scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and stretch the sifac upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles encompassing it; and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either with its totality, or in fragments, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not diligently examine it, security is not achieved in its incision, lest the water return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If, however, the egg proceeds outward from its skin during the time of your operation: then, when you have completed the incision of the sifac, return it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather the two lips of the skin of the testicles with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as the other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a corrupted egg by reason of another blackness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels, which are the suspensories, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory, and remove the egg; afterwards treat it with what we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If, however, water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches; therefore cut the other part in the same manner as you did the other, equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it; afterwards wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the sections wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the middle of the belly; and place over that folded cloths, and they are cushions; and tie them over with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness; and make the ends with which it is pressed of cotton, or damp wool; and let them be gathered with a constriction at the lumbar part of the breeches; and one end take over the anus up to the back, and the second take to the part of the pubic bone; and two ends over the two thighs below, and two other ends over the two groins, and the whole constriction be gathered at the lumbar part of the breeches.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And, sometimes, this branch is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of the incision with iron; and it is that you take a fine, knife-like cautery and cut with it the skin of the testicles; and it is heated, according to what we have described; until, when a white substance containing water is revealed, then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It resembles the Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with it, and it is heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated fine cautery, and cut it as much as possible, until you eradicate the whole of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware of the egg, lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than an operation with a cut.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, opposition occurs to you during the hour of the incision, or during the hour of the cautery, a hot abscess, or blood flow, or something else: then it is necessary to treat that which causes opposition to you from it with the cure that suits it, as has been stated.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect this operation, because of its horror: then administer a perforation, as I describe it: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you by what we have said about signs that the limb is watery, then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula: and place the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a poultice over the affected area, and bandage it, and allow it to drain the remaining water; then treat it, until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is resistance to the egress of water at the time you pierce it: and this is only because a white membrane causes resistance in the wound opening and prevents the escape of water: then it is necessary that you insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of hydrops is extracted, whose form preceded: or add to the operation of the wound for a short time.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns and collects after six months, or about that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it collects, then it should be pierced according to the same method, and the sick person will pass their days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Concerning the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the section above this tumor, there is fear leading to harm in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal is better than that.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am recalling the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	Therefore, I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and that is made from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute or acrid superfluity, which is poured out to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and it is a severe abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it arises from the knotting of arteries and their inflation, as its prior mention has already shown, or from the inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore, that which arises from the inflation of arteries is recognized by the disposition of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you need not touch it entirely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	But that which arises from the inflation of veins does not disperse anything from it upon compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section be made upon this type, and upon the remaining flesh: and it is, as if you separate the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the egg upward, and extract it with a white sifach: and free the suspensory from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from all parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary to pull the egg, and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between some siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary to free all that adhesion, and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however there is a nativity of flesh in the place of adhesion that is behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the treatment of Ramicis, which is with Vite.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Vitis is an abscess enveloped by a certain covering, similar to a bunch of grapes, with a softening of the testicles; and it makes difficult for the infirm movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded it being remembered.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary, that we say, the operation in it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that it is necessary that you make the infirm person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspensory of the testicles downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the vessels that are near the penis; and let another attendant hold them, and extend them with a violent extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad, sharp spatule in a transverse section directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape away from every side, as we said to you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterwards, insert into them a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the veins occur; and tie it again at their last.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in the middle, in a straight section along the length of the body, and extract that which is collected from corrupt, foul humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which the force generates pus, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For there is no harm through it.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	However, if it happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted with the vessels, so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment due to the incision and decays or dries up, and there is no benefit with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Concerning the treatment of intestinal worms.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The outcome of this worm is from a section, which happens in the extended sifach above the abdomen in the groin area from a wound of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from a sifach, or an extension of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a cry, or lifting a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign, when it is from the extension of sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal to the depth: because the sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And a sign of it when it is from a section of sifach, because it causes a severe pain to occur suddenly at its beginning: and it is a different abscess, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it emerges with the intestine as a zirbum: and this is called a Ramix intestinalis, and zirbia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes faeces run into the intestine, and are retained there: and there is harm with it for the sick person: because it causes a mild pain, and especially when pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these types of illness, there is fear with iron; therefore, it is necessary to avoid such an event.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is that you should instruct the sick person to draw back the intestine with his own hand to the inner cavity of his body, if it yields to being pulled back.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he should be laid back on his neck between your hands, and his legs raised.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles completely lengthwise.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then place hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them, and let the incision be according to the amount that is possible, so that the egg may emerge from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape away the siphak and whatever is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is uncovered on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and detach with it the adhesion which is on the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand the skin of the testicles inwards; and with this, stretch the white siphak upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with the siphak towards the incision; and command the servant to stretch the egg upwards, and you detach the adhesion, which is behind the complete separation.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers to see that there is nothing there of the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If, however, you find anything from it, then push it towards the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle, on which is thick thread, made of linen from ten threads, and insert it at the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles that follows the incision; then cut the ends which protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over some with a figure which is in the manner of a cross; and tie them with the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is beneath the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until no vessel, which nourishes them, can send anything to them: so that no hot abscess may occur from this.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again a ligature second, outside the first ligature, distant from it by less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, leave from the siphak, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger; and cut the rest entirely around, and remove the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles the incision, from which runs blood and pus, as we have narrated in that which is said before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound; and apply the ligature that we have narrated.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white sifach that we spoke of is cauterized, after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, its falling is delayed, then it should be moistened with hot water; and place upon it that which we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning the windy (or:  windy-disease) ram.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this ram disease, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron in its treatment.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And indeed the first ones said that it occurs as we have described in the ram disease that is with the vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, tie the vessels after the incision over them easily from below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat with whatever opens it, until the vessels fall away; and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning the rupture that occurs in the inguinal region.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends into the scrotum: and if something does descend, it is little, and returns every hour: but if the time passes with this, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that happens from the stretching of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	This is because the sifach stretches; then the area softens, and the place becomes suppurated, and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as its previous description stated.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron, according to this method: and it is that the sick person lie on their back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the suppurated and protruding place of the rupture, cutting across the width, according to the amount of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then draw tight the alsifak and what is under the skin, until the white sifach is revealed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a rod, and place it on the protruding place of the sifach, and press it into the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew the two protruding places on the end of the rod from the sifach, and connect one of them to the other with a suture; then pull out the end of the rod.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the alsifach entirely, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of the intestinal ramicis.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the sisach contracts, and does not add to the prominence of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place, because it is nearer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, because of which the flesh between them is softened, and its appearance is marred.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary for him who is asked to treat it, that he make the sick man lie on his back, and cut all the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then, he shall bring together the two folds with sutures: and if he wishes, he shall first suture the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and make the sutures firm.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then, cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then, treat the treatment of the remaining wounds, until it is healed and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	Concerning Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated in our law, and because of that it would be permissible for me not to recall it in this book of mine; and its mention is not necessary except for two ways.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it should be in the physician's knowledge when questioned about it, and so that he may know its treatment for the one who has suffered it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another way is that we frequently require the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore, I say that castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by fissure and section.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water, until its testicles are softened and relaxed and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are dissolved and do not appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by fissure and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut above each testicle with a single incision, until two testicles are exposed.  Then cut them after you have peeled off each, and do not leave on them any sifaket other than the thin sifac, which is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Concerning the treatment of Hermaphrodites, there are two methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from men in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because a space appears in it, or in the skin of the testicles, in the area between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine runs from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one species, and it is a woman's vulva above the pubis, like very small male testicles, protruding outward; of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three species, two from men, and one species from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until the impression of them is gone.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the treatment of the remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second species of men, from which urine emerges, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure for it at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the incision of the Tentigo, and the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	Tentigo perhaps grows over the natural state, until its appearance becomes unsightly and foul: and sometimes in some women it magnifies so much, until it expands like in men, and reaches the point of intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, you should hold the excess Tentigo with your hand or a hook, and cut it; and do not stop cutting, especially at the deep root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the treatment for wounds until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, the flesh that arises is flesh that grows in the orifice of the womb until it fills it: and perhaps it emerges to the exterior in the likeness of a tail; and because of this some earlier writers call this illness "tailed disease.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut it like we cut Tentigo, and to treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is the unpierced vulva of a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is, that the vulva of a woman is not perforated, or the opening is small.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is it from an illness that preceded it: and indeed it is made either from added born flesh, or from thin or thick syrphach: and it is made either in the deep of the matrix, or in its sides, or in its upper or lower part: and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And its knowledge is made through the observation of the midwife, if an apparent blockage is nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the blockage is from thin syrphach, and is near the two lips: then hurry, and break it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you place cushions on the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs outstretched.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then spread the two lips with strength, until the thin syrphach is broken, and the blockage is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it over the place: and let the woman apply it daily, so that the place will not consolidate again.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a spatula broad like a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If however the blockage is of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that curb the flow of blood without causing a bite, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for a few days: and administer lint made from dried linen, then treat the remainder with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes a birth of other flesh grows in the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be cut according to this method, as long as it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess that is in the womb, no opposition should be made with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red Bothor in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the veins' orifices, until much blood flows from them continuously.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil; and I have already stated in the division of their species and their signs; and I shall say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	Therefore I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no treatment with iron for them.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	However, those of them which are in the orifice of the womb over which sensation falls, are those which are treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the thelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over them at the flow of blood from one of the powdered incisions without mastication: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and things similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then let him drive her feet to the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, lay her down in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and quince bark, and galls, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If, therefore, blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, make cupping vessels adhere to the back and under the breasts, without incision.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnogloss, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, or Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When, therefore, the abscess rests, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth, however, is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary that you cut what appears from it, according to what I said about the thelil equally: and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Concerning the perforation of the passage that occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and inflamed swellings, and alekilati, that is, herpes, erysipelas, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And indeed I have already mentioned all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses that collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary to consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then, if the pain of the abscess in its inception is acute with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it red: if feeling falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with that which aids in maturation, until when the acuteness of the occurrences subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that slopes down two seats, and that she reclines, or is supported on her back, and that she draws her feet to the lower part of her belly: and that her thighs be spread open, and that she place her arms under her knees, and that she bind each with a suitable bandage to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary, when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix it with the rod deep in the woman's womb, so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb and harms the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	However, if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions over the depth of the womb: so that the entrance of the entire instrument into the womb's depth is prevented: and it is necessary that it place the pivot, which runs along the instrument, from the upper side; and that it hold the instrument, and that the attendant turn the pivot, until the depth of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by the hand, and is smooth and soft, then it is necessary that you separate it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and place the cloth, and extract the section within the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally on the womb, and upon the vulva, clean wool soaked in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then treat it after two days with an ointment suitable for it, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is injected with water and honey; then with water in which the lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden internally within the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron; rather, treat it with what we said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrines of Midwives, how living embryos are treated, having emerged in a non-natural form.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXX.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to know first the form of natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, among its signs is this: when you see a woman pressing downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and she is relieved of what is upon her from the birth, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is upon her head, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her abdomen be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends upon her head, the afterbirth descends with it, and she is cleansed from those superfluities with good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	However, any birth other than this one is unnatural, blameworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus emerges on its feet, and its body emerges before its head and its feet, and its hand or foot alone; or its head and hand emerge; or the belly emerges; and perhaps it turns on its neck, and similar forms are blameworthy.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception; and I am showing every form of them, and how the nature of it is, and how it is to be signified and to stand over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges on its head in its natural emergence, and it becomes violent upon the woman, and her labor becomes difficult, and you see her strength already weakened, then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her; and apply vapors to her vulva with decoction of fenugreek and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and with it split the afterbirth, and cut it with her fingernail until that which is in it from moisture runs out; and press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then the woman must be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her, after the enema, to compress herself; and make her sneeze with seasonings, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will emerge immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If the fetus's two hands emerge first, it is necessary to gently and gradually draw them back.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If, however, it does not yield on entry, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet up; then shake the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If, therefore, the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remaining fetus; and bind its hand with cloth, and extract it with evenness; for it will emerge.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo is above its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges above its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards, straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When, therefore, they emerge up to the hips, then command him to be compressed, and make him sneeze with condiments; for it will emerge, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not emerge with what we have recounted, then return the fetus gradually, until you place it in its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will then emerge with ease.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is prevented with all that we have recounted, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound all in a mortar with good pounding: then line with it the woman's vulva and the lower part of her abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in lukewarm water, until she achieves hypocundria.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her a poultice of myrrh and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore the poultice has held for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and bind her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fever will depart immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The birth of the fetus is on the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it emerges in this manner, then gently insert her hands.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie on her back, with her feet hanging down: and she should lie on the bed, and fold her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gently on her abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows, until it is prepared at the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a forceful motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press gently on what is above the hypochondria, until the fetus ascends to the upper part.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then let her introduce her hands, and gently adjust the fetus: and order the woman to compress, until the fetus emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Let his hand be inserted in the reduction.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman, and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If however she cannot walk, then make her lie down on a bed: and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If, however, childbirth takes it, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and bring the fetus back to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and order her to press herself, until it emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus is upon her neck, with hands outstretched, and its face towards her mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife ought to hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it over, and bring it into alignment with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When, therefore, it is aligned, then place upon her vulva that which we have described from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then order her to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and order her to lean to her right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then order her to press [herself] and make her sneeze with a condiment.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus on its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is evacuated from moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel, so that it is not retained, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inward until you place it as it should be, and order the woman to press herself several times; for it will emerge through a light exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	However, five is a thing outside nature, and they do not live at all; and one afterbirth contains them, however numerous, and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing between them, tied to the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they emerge as a single fetus emerges by a natural, easy exit, and they emerge with an ignominious exit, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult at birth, and reach the condition we have described from unnatural figures, then treat them as we have narrated; and let the midwife be skillful, and let her do what she does with ease and deliberation, and let her devise according to every form with what is prepared for her from ingenuity leading to health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder of that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has been verified with me that a woman, when she miscarried, expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, this entire matter must be within the knowledge of the Midwife.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	For perhaps it will come to her similar to that; therefore, let her oppose it with that which is appropriate.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division of medications, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use an operation with the hand, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted by any of the accidents from which harm is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid supine on a bed, on her back, and her head be lowered, and her legs raised; and the attendant shall hold her from two sides, or she shall be bound to the bed, so that her body is not disturbed during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the womb with humid oils with the mucilage of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife shall anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages, then shall introduce it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she shall seek with it the place where she shall fix the hooks on the fetus, and the places suitable for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in the places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubis and middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand, and place its curvature in that which is between the fingers of her left hand, and introduce it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she shall fix another hook, or a third if needed, in opposition to it, so that there is an equal contraction and it does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not only be straight, but rather move in every direction, so that its exit may be eased; as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary that the extension be softened in that which is between them.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them from the side, so that she may turn with them that which is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If, therefore, a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks should be moved to another, higher place; do this until the entire fetus emerges.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If, therefore, a hand emerges before the other parts, and it is not possible to return it, because of its constriction, then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then draw it out until, when the whole emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow; and thus it is necessary that you do in the other hand and in the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If, however, the fetus's head is large, or constriction occurs in its exit, or water is gathered in its head, then it is necessary that they insert a thorny Spatumile between the fingers, and split the head with it, and extract the water; or break it with the instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus has a naturally large head, then it is necessary to cut away the obstructing parts; or extract it with misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head emerges and is constricted at the fork, then it should be split until the moisture in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it is not tangled, nor yields to the exit, then cut the head into pieces, according as is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower part of the abdomen has an abscess, or has dropsy in it, then it is necessary to pierce it until moisture flows from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If the fetus is positioned above its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the opening of the womb is gentle.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If, however, it is constricted at the abdomen or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand, and split the abdomen or chest until that which is in them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If the other limbs are removed, and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If, therefore, the opening of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the womb, and search with it for the head, and pull it with her fingers up to the opening of the womb; then she should insert one hook, or two hooks, into it, and pull it with that.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If, however, the opening of the womb is constricted, due to a hot abscess that has occurred in it, then it is not necessary to exert effort on it, rather it is necessary to administer the outflow of humid, oily things, and apply plasters, and she should sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to equalize it; then administer what we have said about a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you not leave any part of the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about hot abscesses that occur in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If a flow of blood occurs, then it should be placed in styptic waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have already seen a woman, in whose belly a dead fetus was: then she became pregnant again over it, afterwards another fetus died as well.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it became swollen until it opened, and began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called to treat her, and I medicated her for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore, I placed upon it some strong-drawing plasters, and bone came out from the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore amazed by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I therefore thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore investigated the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in her better dispositions: and she has now lived thus for a long time, and a little pus comes out from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I would not have affirmed this extraneous thing, unless there is knowledge and assistance in it, which the skilled physician administers with the hand from the cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Concerning the forms of necessary instruments in the extraction of a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of a Straighter, by which books are made equal, which equally has two turns at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this turn must be finer than the straighter; and to make it, either from ebony or from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each piece of wood is about two fingers; and the margin of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are now fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the opening of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two turns.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the turn by which the matrix is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to it, finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its extremity there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When therefore you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, opening what is between her legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two joined additions into the matrix: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wishes.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Another form of Vertigo, which the ancients called the Form of the Impeller, by which the fetus is impelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The Almisdac form, by which the large head is crushed: and it is likened to a pair of tongs, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it becomes oblong, like tongs of this form, as you see, which has teeth like saw teeth, with which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The Almisdac form by which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of a hook with a single spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of a hook with two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of tongs with saw teeth, with which the fetus's head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of a scalpel with two ends for severing the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two broad scalpels.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used, and the more their types are multiplied, and they are prepared by the craftsman, the quicker he is at his work, and the higher he is esteemed among people, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not despise any instrument of them, lest it be not prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Concerning the extraction of the Secundine.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Secundine is retained at childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with condiments: and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it emerges by this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid: and place in it herbs that open the mother's mouth, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, seham, cinnamon, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed plug over the hole of the pot's lid, and the other end in the woman's womb: and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	However, if it remains after this treatment, and does not emerge, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then let her introduce it into the vagina, and seek out the afterbirth with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she finds it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	However, if it is attached deep within the womb, then let her introduce her hand, as we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and draw it out gradually in a straight line, so that the womb does not fall during a forceful pulling: indeed, it is necessary that it is moved with ease to the right and left sides, and then the pulling force should be increased.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it will then yield, and be preserved, and escape from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with medication from a pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If, however, it does not emerge with all that we have described, then beware of tiring yourself out in repeated attempts at extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that whatever emerges from it to the mouth of the womb be tied to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then inject her with a clyster of tetrapharmacon ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For this will cause it to putrefy after days, and it will dissolve, and emerge.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it putrefies, an evil odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and injures the weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients have already experienced fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument with which one fumigates a woman in the retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made of glass similar to a lamp, or of earthenware: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and the fumigation be placed over the embers: let her hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and again another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Concerning the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born with their anuses unperforated, which the subtle sifac has already obstructed.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife should pierce that sifac with her finger; and if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula, and be cautious not to injure the surrounding tissue.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place upon it wool steeped in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And obstruction of the anus also happens from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut that consolidation, then treat it with what we said concerning treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the treatment of Fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodules and swellings that occur near the anus externally, or in the space of one part: and it is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that nodule ages, it opens, and watery white moisture, or thin pus, runs from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, penetrating ones are recognized by that which exits with excretion and windiness, when the sick person uses excretion; and perhaps worms exit from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And some of them are fistulas when they are in the space penetrating up to the bladder and up to the urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And some of them are penetrating up to the hip joint and up to the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	By this, a penetrating fistula up to the anus is known, even from a non-penetrating one, that you insert your index finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe into the fistula from air or iron, when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is twisting in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe, or a hair from a horse's mane, until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything emerge from the opening with excretion, nor wind, nor worms as I said, then know that it is non-penetrating: therefore hasten to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to the bladder, or to the urinary meatus, then its indication is the excretion of urine from it, and the prohibition of it from this so that the place may be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If however it is penetrating up to the hip joint, or to the hip bone, then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twisting in it up to the bone, and the finding of pain around the part, and that pus emerges from it always, and that treatment in it does not work, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and their treatment is labor and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	However, in that which is not penetrating and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I tell you, and I have already proved: and it is that the sick person should lie between your hands on their back, and raise their legs above their hips, and their hips should be inclined towards their belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the sick person feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If, therefore, you feel the probe in your finger having already penetrated itself detected, besides what you feel between your finger and the fistula, or flesh: then you know for certain that it is penetrating: therefore, do not work on it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They have said, however, that in some people the flesh is healed, and that through medication of which benefit is hoped for, it is to apply a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and to insert it heated into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this twice or thrice, until you know that all those added, filtered, flesh-like tissues that resemble the quill of a bird's wing are already burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those burned tissues come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If, therefore, it is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never be healed with another treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the protrusion emerges, and does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the protrusion, or similarly: and you see a fistula where the skin surface follows, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the protrusion which is in the fistula, until the cut reaches where the end of the protrusion reaches, and the protrusion is released and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered tissues, which are similar to the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	However, if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation, so that you cut those tissues: then better, and of quicker aid, cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because cauterization with fire aggregates good qualities, the burning of those added tissues, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying of the moistures.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with cloths wrapped in butter, or crushed herbs, until the place discharges pus, and those burned tissues exit in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which produce hard flesh: and these are medicines that have astringency and dryness.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and is elongated by bodily superfluity: then introduce your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a stricture, and between you and it is a membrane of sifac or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation on it, except according to the path of confidence and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	For this is because one of three methods is administered to it: either to cauterize it, as we have said; or to dissect it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to introduce a ligature, and cure from the vicinity.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the incision, so that you do not cut the ligament containing the anus, and inflict on the weak a consequence of evacuation without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps indeed it will be cured; or you will lengthen the membrane, and cleanse it after you have cut it close to the anus, as we said, either with forceps or with another instrument of sharp tip.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh that are in the incision, until where you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision, and the upper opening where it consolidates; and a fistula will remain open in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier on the weak.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you introduce a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus, near the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like an alef needle, that is, for preparing hides, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it a thread wrapped in five threads, and around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then introduce the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it penetrates into the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out from that opening; so that you introduce your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together; and tie each one, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread penetrates the flesh, tie it tightly until those tissues between the two thread ends are cut and fall away; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you do not have the ability to do this on account of the muscle, so as not to injure it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Shape a thorn-like spatula, with a very sharp curve, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not injure what is unnecessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision, and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter Eighty-one.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	Hemorrhoids are according to two methods.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For they are either within the anus, similar to sacks of coals or prunes, or as if they were bunches of grapes themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them are small, and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those which are outside the anus, are for the most part few in moisture, from which flows yellow water, or little blood with constant running: and they are according to the colour of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is within the anus is that you should order the sick person to strain: and it should be pressed out, until it emerges from the anus, and the atheril appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore also suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If however the hooks do not hold on them, because of their moisture and their softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with cotton made from double-layered wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and after the incision sprinkle some warm powders over them, so that they may stand in the place of a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then inject the infirm with an enema containing a small amount of mordicatio, so that it washes out what is in the anus, and it yields to evacuation quickly when the infirm expresses himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If, however, the piles are external from the anus, then their removal is easy: and it is as if you take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever abhors incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a wrapped thread, and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw the piles upwards, and cause it to penetrate with the needle into its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be latitudinally: and tighten the piles with a strong tightening.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do that with all the piles, and leave one of them: and do not sew it, so that blood will run from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil, or cerote, and place it over the anus: and tell the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and other treatment until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Concerning the treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Indeed, they often happen from the drying out of feces and from the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become hardened, and medicine is of no avail for them, then it is necessary to scrape them with a sharp-pointed spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the top layer which prevents their consolidation is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them until they consolidate as is appropriate.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	However, if they do not consolidate, then scrape them again with a more forceful instrument than the first, until they bleed profusely and are abraded; then treat them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted Almirmar, and of dry Athelil and Formicae.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter Eighty-two.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing other than a rounded swelling the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail; and it forms throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and pain arises from it during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut that which is around the nail, and to hold it with shears, or with a hook, and to remove it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From dry athelil, one is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is to stretch the athelil, and cut it; or to bind it with a silk thread; or with a needle, until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now inverted athelil are eradicated, and not inverted with the instrument which I shall name.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A formica is also a small, filtered, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going deep: and when cold finds it, a sensation like the bite of an ant is felt in it, and it occurs throughout the body; and most of it occurs in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is to take a cannula from a goose's feather, or a strong falcon's feather, and place that cannula over the Formica, until the circle of the cannula encompasses its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the cannula, until you cut what is around the Formica; and you place it deep into the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the top of the cannula be drawn up to the height of the deaf wrapping, so that the grasping and turning of it and itself may be relieved over the finger.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what is mentioned in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on the cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Of the forms of instruments that are administered to enemas in diseases of the anus, and bowel evacuation, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes the clyster is made of silver, or of bronze, or of cast or hammered copper.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made of these instruments small, and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of young children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, likewise their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	Large clyster.
Cistere paruum.	Small clyster.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its tube, that is, the upper end where the bladder is tied, should be wide according to this method; and there should be a distinction so that the bladder is tied as you see, and its lower end that is inserted into the anus should be blunt, that is, not open, smooth, very much, drawing to slenderness; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and slightly thicker; and the bladder in which the medicines are placed should be from the bladder of an animal, or from the paper of an egg, which should be according to the form of a small asofrat; whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be pierced with many holes as it is rolled, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread made from ten threads, or about that number, and bind the bladder with it like an asofrat.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When, therefore, the bladder is placed in it, it should be tightened at the head of the clyster between two distinguishing constrictions with a strong tightening.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then administer the clyster with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the bladders here depicted, and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	However, the quality of administering the clyster with it is: that you fill the bladder, or the vesicle, with medicine, which should be heated according to the tolerance of the patient: and be careful that it is not too hot, or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient should lie on their back, and raise their legs upwards: and place under them an inthaan, that is, a hide upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant grasp the bladder with both hands together, and express it with force, until it evacuates all that is in the clyster into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise their legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine causes him to exit, then let him hold as long as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If, however, you clyster him in diseases of looseness of the belly, and his exit is hurried, then clyster again, until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or harmful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very thin, mild, from the clysters with which children are clystered.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this be the form of a thin clyster above which there is tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the division about the treatment of wounds, which was suitable for the book, and I shall now speak here about their treatment with the hand and with medicaments, according to the completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore, I say that wounds are diversified according to the manner in which they are inflicted, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the things by which wounds are often inflicted are like the throwing of a stone; or the incision of a sword or knife; or a blow with a lance, or wood, or an arrow; and by similar things from many objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	And the wounds that are inflicted according to the parts of the body are, such as a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver; and similar to those from the members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may set forth that reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the recollection of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the impact of a stone, or similar things, and has only broken the skin: and is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately; and do not delay it; and extract from him blood according to the amount of his strength; if there is nothing preventing phlebotomy, especially if the blood that emerges from the wound is scant.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the patient beware of overeating, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If, however, something prevents reduction, then reduce his food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And if a hot abscess happens to him, place on the wound a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If, however, you are certain it is not a hot abscess, then if the wound is fresh with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, place on it the powder I will describe shortly; and if the air has already changed it, then place some ointments on it until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If, however, the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things: and its edges do not come together through pads, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If, however, the wound has already been detached from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the sick person to eat foods in which there is thickness, such as heads of grain and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulp; and things similar to these.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the putrefied part and throw it away; then treat it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If, however, in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by medicines, then investigate the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with a Spatumili, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity compels when that which we said does not help, then cauterize it until the blood is severed.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If, however, these wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, slight: so that you powder them with this powder, because it consolidates them before the air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of the flesh-healing powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime; let the whole be finely ground, and sifted; and fill the wound with it, and bind it tightly, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it further with bandages, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not suppurate.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes quicklime alone does it, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood available; also, dragon's blood performs the same operation on many large wounds, when it is suitable to be applied to them and bandaged, and they are fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If, however, the air has already altered it with some change, especially when it is in the summer season, then the intention of applying this powder is not suitable; therefore, treat it with what we have said, so that you apply some digestive ointments to it; or apply poultices of barley flour, made with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat the rest with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If, however, a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then remove it with traction: and I will now speak of the treatment of fractures of the head in what follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Concerning wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter Eighty-five.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference between it in medication, and a wound of the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If, however, the nerve of the neck, or artery, has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no cure for it except to avoid treatment that causes excessive astringency, like ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm the nerves, and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs; and let that which is used for treatment from medicines be gentle, such as lime washed with sweet water infused with oil several times, or with rose oil, and tutty, when it is also washed with sweet water; and the other mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If, however, the wound is large, then administer sutures; or contract its lips with pledgets.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If however the wound has depth, or a sinus has occurred in its lower part, in which pus has already collected, then pierce it in the lowermost location in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If, however, an artery has already been cut in the wound, and its blood flow has ensued: then separate, or cut it, and tie it; or cauterize it, if necessity prompts that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, the throat's cartilages, or all of it, have been cut, and the surrounding structures have been saved: then bring together the skin's edges with sutures over the throat's cartilage, and do not touch the throat itself, rather make it even and restore it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a proper bandage, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments that possess astringency and drying properties, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then explore it; then, if there are bone fragments within it, extract all of them, or as many as you can; and leave what cannot be removed until the wound becomes putrid, and its discharge separates and is relieved.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then powder over it the powder I described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If, however, bone is seen in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it with what is mentioned in its corresponding chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Concerning a wound in the shoulder blades.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a blow from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If, therefore, wind issues from the wound, when the sick person breathes heavily from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	But if it does not have depth, and is fresh with its blood: then do not put powder on it in the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the sick person; but put an attracting ointment on it, and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If, however, the ointment is not present for you, then put an old poultice in the wound's opening, so that it sucks what emerges from it of the humors; and make the sick person sleep over the wound, so that what is collected in it runs out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If, however, three days or more have already passed for the wound, and no spasm occurs in the sick person, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the rest of his conditions good, then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat him with bandages and the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If, however, his healing is excused, and it always opens again, then know that it has now become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore, treat it according to its chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what has preceded regarding sutures, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If, however, it has already made an impression on the bone and chipped fragments from it, then investigate the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments if they are detached.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If however they are not detached, then leave them until the wound becomes putrid, for the extraction of them will be made easier.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	For other accidental wounds in other limbs, the judgment in treatment is the judgment that we have stated.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their extrusion.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	Rupture which happens to the belly is great, middle, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From great rupture, therefore, sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, exits.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, their introduction, and their suturing is more violent and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore it follows, that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hasten in their introduction to their place immediately; because it is inflated, opened, and thickened; therefore, its entrance becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a better rupture is the middle rupture; because with it there is not a difficult reduction of the intestine, as it is difficult in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suturing of the belly is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures agree with the suturing of the belly, and in the suturing of the remaining wounds of the body; and two other sutures properly agree with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper with the suturing of the belly; and I tell you each one with an exposition and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine protrudes from it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then that is because of one of two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: or because there is inflation in the intestine due to the cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is so, then it is necessary to warm it, so that you immerse a sponge, or a damp cloth, in lukewarm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with squill, and cyperus, and spike, and apply it to the intestine with it until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes wine that has astringency does it, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by that its entrance is alleviated with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the disruption with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when prepared than the incision: and no compulsion is made to cut after necessity and the lack of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted and sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the fine end not be as fine as a Spatumilis, but rather a little more blunt: and that is what is similar to a caiada, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form to its proper place, if possible, above it; because that is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When, however, the rupture is extensive in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it is necessary to administer that in large wounds, and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have a pious attendant present, who holds the entire rupture with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover from it for him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the common mode of a single suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's breadth.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then leave from the extremity of the rupture a quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician: and fix one needle past that into it, passing the thread into both extremities of the skin, with both extremities of that which is under the skin from the interior, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together the two extremities of the skin, and the two extremities of that which is thus: and four rows are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with the double thread in a circular motion of the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are brought together in a fitting aggregation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then leave a thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterwards tie it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease to do that with what needles you need, until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And the needles should be of intermediate thickness between thin and thick; because very thin needles cut flesh very quickly, and thick needles are difficult to enter the skin; therefore they must be intermediate in thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not appropriate for the needle to be fixed in the two closely adjacent skin edges too much, so that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound is opened before it is consolidated, and they should not be pulled too tight with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then trim the ends of the needles, so that they do not harm the patient during their sleep; and put pads of cloth on all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of suture with needles is more suitable in small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because one or two, or approximately that number, of needles is sufficient for their suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	However, the second common suture is to bring together the four edges: two skin edges and two edges of a similar nature, with a needle in which an equal thread, fine and thick, is wound.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you have pierced these four edges with the needle, pull the needle back from the side from which you began, so that the wound thread falls from the upper part of the wound; so that the suture will be like the stitching of cloth used to bind cloths, and place between each stitch a quantity equal to the thickness of a smaller finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	However, men know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I myself healed a wound which had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was torn open more than a palm; and about two palms of the middle intestine had emerged from the intestines, and the rupture was in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	Therefore the wound was consolidated in a space of approximately fifteen days; and I treated him, and he was healed; and he lived many years after that, engaged in his affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was by a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor any medicine, was to be found.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Therefore, I placed old linen over the wound twice a day, and diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will now state two specific types of suture, according to the account of the text.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and going into the muscle along the length and breadth of the entire body, leave the end thus in the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate in the other end from the inner part to the outer in the other extremity mirach.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extremity mirach from the outer part to the inner: and leave the extremity sifac, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other extremity from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration, as you make it penetrate in the sifac extremity mirach, which is on its side, until it penetrates the whole of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the extremity, which is from sifac on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it has pierced.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then return it to that skin, and sew the sifac extremity, which is on the other side, with this mirach extremity: and withdraw it from the skin which is on its side, and do it once, and again: and do it time after time, until you sew the whole exterior according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that it sew the skin of the leather workers, as they sew skins: so that you sew sifac with one turn from one extremity of the skin: and that you let it go with another turn from the other side, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second species of proper suture, which Galen said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	His speech relates that you should sew it according to the manner in which some physicians sew them, so that they bring every part to its naturally fitting counterpart; and they apply the sifac extremity to its other extremity, and the mirach extremity to its other extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You should place the needle into the mirach extremity closest to you on the outside, and have it pierce to the inside in that part only; and you should let go of the two sifac extremities.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside to the inside in the two sifac extremities, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both of them, also making them pierce from the inside to the outside in the two other mirach extremities, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and is a suture whose recollection precedes.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also Galen's discourse.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, insert one thread in each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from the one that is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew leather equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than the other parts of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	However, the judgment of the treatment of a wound is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, when you acquire a fresh wound with its own blood, before air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and suture it, and fit it, then place it over the flesh-inducing powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If air has already altered the wound, then place upon it some ointments that are present to you, until they produce pus: and the threads fall, and it consolidates, and mirach.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	However, if the medicines are not present to you, then place upon it immediately, from when it begins to emit pus, old cloth: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need another medicine in many cases, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If, however, you fear that the wound communicates with the principal limbs in the injury, then it is necessary that you immerse soft wool in oil of temperate warmth, or in rose oil: and place it around the places which are between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If, however, he feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens) then enema him with astringent, black, warm wine: especially if putridity has already reached the intestine, and has become a penetrating exit right to its cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing: and that which is from the small, of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, a space has passed it, and it has already become green, or black, then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place which has blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in zirbum are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut that which is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the pulling of it may be alleviated upon you, and the extraction of it at the occurrence of zirbum, and the emission of the wound's pus.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Memorization of the wound that occurs in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some people; for this reason, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a spear thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old; and it became a fistula, and excrement and wind issued from it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore, I applied a treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until he was healed, and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick man, that an evil accident might befall him in his belly; and no such evil accident befell him from that.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and copulating, and entered a bath, and exercised in his daily activities.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now certain experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is necessary that it be ligated in this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you should take ants of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those which have an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore it has settled upon them, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not loosen.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the size of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and suture the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm comes to the sick person at all.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible that the intestine be tied even with a fine thread: which is cleaned from the intestine of an animal, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and it is much scraped.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its extremity.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it into the disruption.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of sewing with ants and intestine is not except according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy except subtlety, nor is its healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Concerning the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound, or abscess, when it grows old and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and continually discharges pus, and is not cut away: then it is universally called, wherever in the body it may be, a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula, in truth, is a filtered, hard, white knot; with which there is no pain, having the concavity of a bird's feather: and because of this some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And in some hours it is moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is cut open in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little; and sometimes thick, and sometimes thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already mentioned in the division, when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor flesh grows on it, is not that but for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body, or because of its malice, or because between it and on its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the birth of flesh, or because it is full of filth and dirt, or because the ulcer is itself putrid, and the material applied to it is of poor quality, or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment, or because corruption falling in the region is a form of pestilence, or because of a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, in which there is difficult digestion of illnesses, and the healing of abscesses by nature is delayed, or because there is one bone, or a number of bones, in it.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here to make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by the way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore know that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For of them are Fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews, or the intestines, or the bladder, or to any of the ribs, or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joints of the limbs, such as hands and feet; and of them are those that go to the proximity of the principal limb, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, whichever of these fistulas is of this type, is from illnesses difficult to cure, and does not receive treatment, and dealing with it is laborious and ignorant.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to arrive at its understanding, then take a probe of air or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If however there is a winding in the fistula, then investigate it with a slender lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, with the lightness of its body, is easily moved and bent around the winding.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, irrigate it from one of its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture you irrigate it with, goes towards the other openings, and runs from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then diligently investigate how you can determine whether there is a bone or nerve, and whether the fistula's hollow is deep or shallow, or whether it is a single fistula with many openings.  Stand over the entire area with all your strength, questioning the ill person, and by feeling the pain when you press with your hand on the area and by similar signs and causes of accidents and abscesses.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When, therefore, you have stood over all that area correctly, then proceed to the treatment with confidence.  And you should consider if the fistula is a superficial one, or located safely far from a joint, or a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places I have told you about.  Then, cut the fistula according to what I have previously described, and remove what is inside it: pus, and corrupted flesh that grows from the fistula's opening or the surrounding tissue, and other similar things.  And treat it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If, however, the fistula is deep and located properly, then you must cut it as deep as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply strips soaked in sharp medicines, and insert them into the hollow of the fistula that you have grasped with the iron. Do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the fistula's hollow from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal by that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If, therefore, the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is confirmed by you, then search for it and cut it according to what I have told you: if nothing from a vein, or nerve, or principal limb hinders you, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If, therefore, bone is found by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with that which causes it to flesh over, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal, and discharges pus as it did: then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, expose it again and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with all your strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it therefore heals, it is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a deep distant part of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore, you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If, however, there are many bones, then carefully make an extraction of all of them, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, some moisture creates an obstacle for you, and there is no fear or error in incising them: then incise those moistures and flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If, however, you do not have the preparation to remove the bones from your time, then place over the wound something that will cause it to putrefy: and leave it, until that which is around those bones is putrefied from the flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And bind the section that you have cut in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Indeed, place over it, if you fear, a cloth soaked in crushed sulfur mixed with oil; or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any other green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humidities putrefy, and the bones separate from them, the removal and extraction of them is alleviated.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If however there is one large bone, such as a bone of the leg, or a hip bone, and similar to them, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If however that which is corrupted within it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it, and to cut it completely up to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it consolidates.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you a story, which happened to a man in his leg: so that you may place it as an example and help upon your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years, to whom pain happened in his leg, from a cause that arose within his body, that is, from the insides, until the matter reached the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So, time passed with him and with the errors of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many matters ran together with him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was delayed, until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus and the humors of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wise one in the art of hands among them, until I was called, and saw his leg, and the matters that were running from those openings with great flow: also the whole body of the man was now putrid, and his color was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to reach one another from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Therefore, I proceeded and cut over one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already corroded, and blackened, and putrid, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Therefore, I removed what I had uncovered, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I judged that there was nothing in the bone but that corruption which I had cut away and removed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied a restorative treatment to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried again, and discovered a second layer of bone above the first: and I found continuous corruption along with the bone; and I removed what appeared to me to be corruption from that as well.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore I again probed it, and did not cease cutting the bone piece by piece, and attempting its restoration: and it was not restored until I cut away about a palm's breadth from the bone and removed it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly and healed: and this repetition in its operation and incision was not necessary, except because of the weak patient's condition, and their small tolerance, and my fear for their death; for it happened to them at all hours due to the excess of evacuative syncopes.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore he was healed completely: and firm flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his body's condition became good, and his strength returned, and he resumed his normal functions, and no impediment to walking was caused to him at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	However, if a prominent bone in a fractured part of the body exists, then it is necessary to saw it, in this manner: and this is so that you take a bandage and tighten it at the extremity of the prominent bone, and instruct someone to extend it upwards, and place another bandage of thicker wool over the first bandage.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it over the flesh which is beneath the bone: and extend its extremity so that you pull the flesh downwards: and you uncover the flesh over the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood, or a plank, underneath the bone properly below: for when you do this, it does not hinder it from cutting the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place for a little while, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone, and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compels sawing in another place.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted, and is not prominent, but rather its part continues with another part, and the corruption is in its middle or in a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all sides entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued from the other part; and let the sawing be along the length from the corruption a little, according to what we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it but abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the finger of the hand, or in the toe of the foot: then the matter is very difficult in it.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever remedy it is rectified for you: when it does not cause you opposition from the vein, or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many chisels and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a suitable instrument of every kind of operation for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations indicate to you the form of the instrument you need, when you have diligent study.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art is a testament to the methods of illnesses; for then you will already find for yourself that which is suitable for it from the instruments for every ailment.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am giving you, in the final part of this chapter, the number of instruments, which you will use as examples for what you will cut, and the proof by which you will test others.
Forma Serrae.	Saw shape.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This saw shape, depicted, be made decently.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arch be sharpness of iron; and its handle of boxwood, and let it be a pyramid, decently made.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Shape of the razor's joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be, according to the shape of a star-shaped nail's head; and its points be according to the shape of the points of a whetstone.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it when they are damaged, or the bone is large and great.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Shape of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Shape of the middle razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Shape of the broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Shape of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Shape of the other, slender razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Shape of the other razor with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Shape of a small, slender, taut razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Shape of the razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Shape of a large razor as well.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw; it is shown in many places by reason of cutting bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Shape of the razor suitable for the cutting of what is perforated in the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, with sharp ends.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made of India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, all that we have said must be done with razors, and knives, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	Extremities putrefy either from an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore, if you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and the treatment does not help, and you see the corruption affecting a limb, which nothing is repelling: then you must cut that limb to the point where the corruption reaches, so that it escapes weakness by it from death, or from an evil that is greater than the limb's defect.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And a sign of this happening is that the limb darkens until it rots; that fire has burned it, or that it rots after turning black; until that rot is cut to the point following that limb, and spreads to the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, act quickly with its incision, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, viper, and rattlesnake, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If, therefore, the corruption or injury is in the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to proceed to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold of the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades it, then cut the arm at the elbow at its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If, however, the corruption passes, and you see it about the elbow, then in that is the death of the sick person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that from treatment, is a matter of virtuosity.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades the toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it takes hold of the foot's sole, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If, however, it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If, however, the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for dismissal, and leaving the sick person to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the manner of cutting off a limb, or sawing it, is that you should tighten the ligament below which you wish to cut; and tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the servant extend one ligament downwards; and let the servant extend the other ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you should separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it should be cut, or sawn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw does not touch healthy tissue; and that added injury and a hot abscess befall the sick person.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, an internal bleeding occurs while you are working, then cauterize the place quickly, or place some powders that stop bleeding on it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and care for it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same event that I tell you about.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because a blackness occurred in his foot, with a burning like the combustion of fire: and that corruption first occurred in his toe, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore, the man hurried himself, after he saw the corruption occurring in the limb with its intensity, which he found from its pain and burning: and it occurred to him at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time passed, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Therefore, he came to me, and I tried to remove that excess with what I placed on his hand from medicines after cleansing his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger: until the corruption began to affect his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	Therefore, he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping for a repulsion of that excess from me: and I also feared death for him at the incision of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the man's strength was over the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it reached me about him, that he hastened, and cut his whole hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not brought forth this narration, except that it might be of assistance concerning that which falls under this kind of illness: and that it might be a signification by which one might signify and act accordingly.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Of the treatment of Sinuses, and the nature of clysterization with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts, or is pierced, and that which is within it of pus escapes, and a hollow place remains, as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it, like a cloth that has already become thin: and it has not reached the final stage of its corruption, nor does it affect the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged until the corruption affects any of these parts, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is to cut away that entire skin as it is rolled back, and especially when it has become thin, and is like a cloth; and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	However, if you suspect that the skin adheres, and that corruption does not follow from that final adhesion; and if there is a thickening of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster; and it is necessary to consider it as a Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then, if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor, then clyster it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, and these are to be aggregated in a vessel; and they are to be boiled over fire, until the medicine turns red; and it comes to the consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take of that which you need; and dissolve it with water and honey, and clyster the sinus with it; and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for a period of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with pressure; do this for so many days, until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present for you; and it is necessary to take the ash of vine wood, or the ash from holly wood; and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and clyster with it, until you are confident that the sinus is now cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient does not tolerate Egyptian medicine, nor ash water, then clyster him with water and honey, to which has been mixed something of crushed ziniar.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clyster him with honey and wine mixed, because of the property of honey is to cleanse and wash away; and wine causes the sinus to adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus is now removed, then clyster him with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is that you take from the dyafinicon plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or clyster him with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the sinus opening is constricted, so that the clyster tube cannot enter, then widen it slightly with an iron implement; or place in it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basil ointment, until it widens.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the opening is also wide, then bring together its edges with a suture, and leave an amount in which the clyster can enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the opening from which pus runs is elevated upwards, then cut it in the lower place within it, so that pus runs from it downwards; because when pus is confined in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing there.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus approximately below the part you wish, then try to prepare the limb in a way that the pus runs from it easily, as preparation allows you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to keep nothing of the pus within it, and take the consolidating medicines that are placed on the sign, suitable to what you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a size that it covers the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors, in a straight line to the opening of the sinus, a hole a little larger than the opening of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it over the first, at a distance from the sinus opening, so that the pus may escape from it, and do not remove the large cloth, except after a few days at a time.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	However, the one over the sinus opening is the one you remove every hour, so that what gathers in it from pus may escape, and so that you may know whether the matter running from it, the virus, is much or little, or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this, again, consider the location of the sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain there, or there is no pain, and whether there is an abscess there, or there is no abscess there.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	Therefore, when your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the matter escaping over the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or approaching adherence; then, therefore, loosen it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you loosen the wound, then change the cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	However, if a thin virus emerges from the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, because there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If, however, undigested pus emerges from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If, therefore, the adherence of the sinus is delayed, and its progress prolonged: then, in the drying of the medicines, let the physicians so arrange that the medicines are moist in their substance, and dry in their virtue; such as the ointment of diaphynicon, when superfluity of addition from zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And the most ultimate of its cures is that you take ointment of diaphynicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it old wine equal in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does a similar action to this, when ointment of diaphynicon is not present to you, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then line a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus: and line with the honey which you boiled until it thickened: and powder spices over it, and place over it the cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of the lily of the valley, and the lily, and herb flour, and centaury are administered in it.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or aggregated, grind them, and sieve them: and powder them over the honey that I have described, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the sinus persists and is not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it: or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then cure it by the treatment of fistulas, as has been previously described.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the treatment of whitlow and worn nail, and the incision of the added finger, and the section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter XCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or the foot: and perhaps it arises in the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When, therefore, the condition persists, and its treatment is neglected, and the abscess becomes a hot abscess: or it is corrupted and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the entire nail, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the end of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	Therefore, when you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary to cut with an iron all the excess which remains of the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cautery is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If, however, the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the superfluous additions of the nail are now pressing the flesh inwards, and beginning to prick it and injure it: then it is necessary to place a fine needle under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards: and cut the flesh easily, and put upon what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until its entire removal.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If, however, corruption has already affected the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and extract it: for it will never be healed while the corrupted bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption spreading into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to the previous mention of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, the nail suffers attrition, or a blow, and a severe pain occurs in it, then it is necessary to first bleed the weak person.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp Spatumili in a transverse cut from above, for visibility.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And beware that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the afflicted by it, and there will be a reason for an addition of flesh to grow in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with that which calms the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The extra finger that arises in some human hands is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps some of them have bones, and perhaps a nail is on it; and some arise at the joint's root, or its birth is in some of the finger's knots.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, the one that arises in some knots of the finger does not move; and the one that arises near the finger's joint perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the one that is fleshy of them, its incision is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	However, the treatment of the one whose birth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from its incision.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that one however, which is born on the finger at the last of the nodes, then it is necessary to cut first its flesh with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable to it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	But consolidation which happens to fingers together often happens either from the birth of the man, that is, is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning of fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary to separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them bandages or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate between them; or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the place is consolidated as it should be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if consolidation happens between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Concerning the incision of a defect.
Caput XCII.	Chapter Ninety-Two.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Ulcers are wrapped veins, large, full of melancholic superfluities that occur in many parts of the body; and their effect is most often in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and work, and carry burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to administer a shaking of the body from black bile occasionally with a strong shaking.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then phlebotomize the patient at the basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they should be cut and the black blood extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein should be raised, and the whole of it extracted.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, bathe the leg in much hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the patient's leg, from the upper part of the thigh to the lower part of the knee, with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise, that is, draw the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and from the upper part, the phlebotomist should first attend to the patient.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail (or something) downwards: until an amount of blood sufficient and bearable by the patient's strength emerges.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie it off; and tell him to abstain from foods producing black bile; and again perform evacuation and phlebotomy, when the veins are filled, and it harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	However, its elevation is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the patient, if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse him in a bath; or apply a warm water embrocation to his leg until it turns red, and the veins protrude; or have him exercise vigorously, if a bath is not available, until the limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin in the direction of the vein incision lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or in the lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from every side, until it appears to the sense: and it is at its appearance, that you see it sloping from red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it then emerges from the skin, you see it white, as if it were a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce a probe beneath it, until when it is lifted and exits the skin: suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make another incision near that incision by three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it with probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need them.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift it, and cut it at the very last incision, near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the incision above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you pull it out of the incision which is higher, or above all the incisions, until the whole thing comes out: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If however it does not yield to you in pulling and lifting it, then insert a needle with a strong doubled thread, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod under it, and turn your hand in every direction until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful not to cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and harm enters upon the weak from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have pulled it all out, then put on the wound place wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and treat it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vine is contracted, having twists for which there is a wrapping to the sides, and is not as we said in terms of straightness, then it is necessary that you cut along every twist of it and the places of its wrapping.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it all out: and be careful in your cutting on it not to cut a vein, or wound it; for it will become difficult for you to lift or remove it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, preserve your caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	Form of the incident whereby the vine is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Form of a blind hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have the curvature like the other hooks, nor a sharp tip so as not to wound a vein: and it is of a thick, flexible form; for if it were slender, it would cut a vein with its slenderness; indeed, let its thickness be excessive, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the vein of the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter Ninety-three.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, like Al-Azeej, and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, of little tenderness, that is, in which no grass or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as occurs within the bodies of snakes and worms (ascarides), and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place becomes blistered.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, then you must wrap a piece of lead over it, whose weight is from one drachm to two drachms, and tie it; and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore something emerges from it outward, wrap that in lead and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it extends very far, then cut a part of it, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at the root before the whole of it emerges.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it must be gently handled and drawn out gradually until the last part of it emerges, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein indeed, in some men, something emerges which is in its length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has come to me that it emerged from a man of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If, however, you cut it during your hour of medication, then introduce a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long, slender probe, until all matter within it is evacuated, and treat the putrefaction of the area with medicines for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself, and it has many openings, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore, treat it as we have said in the division, and with what has been previously stated.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Concerning the incision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called the cattle disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called in a certain land among us the cattle disease, because it often happens to oxen, and is a small, single worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending, and it is shown to the senses by its passage from limb to limb, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes, that is, intestinal worms, and threadworms, occur in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it travels through the body and rises to the head and reaches a place, then perhaps it bursts there, and emerges, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Therefore, when one intends to treat it and extract it, this is not done except by its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong constricting bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it has burrowed into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the area until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If, however, you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick person use cleansing of his body, with medicines dissolving bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods generating putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Concerning the incision above the illness Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then moves from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have already seen it, as I relate to you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a weak woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained one hour, I saw one swelling moving with a quiver, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than possible, so that it is like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore, the pain receded from that place and fixed itself in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was turning around in her whole body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	Therefore, I was amazed at the speed of its change from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I myself had not previously seen this illness with my own eyes in this way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb: and I have not seen it with my eyes, as I have seen it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it is anything else, except that it is because the woman was from those who are from villages, with dry bodies and detected veins: therefore, this windy movement appears to the senses.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When, therefore, you wish to cure it, and the patient feels the pain: then if it is apparent to you with the eye, as we have said, then tighten above it, and below it quickly: and cut above it, until that confined windiness emerges: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If, however, you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with shaking the body, and with that which expels winds, and pacifies them with foul pills, and pills of serpent, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	Concerning the extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in which they strike the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is such, for some have large points, and small ones, and concave, and blunt ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And some have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And some have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And some have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those, however, which are according to the members on which they fall, are according to two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either the members are from the principal concave members, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and similar to them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and signs of death appear to you, which I tell you afterward, then you ought to avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone and exits through the membrane that is over the brain, are: because violent sweating, and blindness, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of bile occur from it.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood exits from the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And white moisture resembling gruel emerges from the wound site.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And from it emerges something like the watery part of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not emerge.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow striking the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and that, when touching it, it feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the pulse's movement, and black blood flows from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Therefore know that death undoubtedly descends.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And a sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the outflow of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels that follow the neck suppurate, and the sick person's color changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a great, deep breath; and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If an arrow strikes the covering, which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great breath with intense pain, with a gasp; and all the shoulder members are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps some indigested food will come out of the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow strikes the abdomen, and is fixed in it, some excrement, or zirbum, or intestine already ruptured, will issue from the wound.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope of curing it, nor of removing the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine issues forth, and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain is stronger than the weakness: then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	However, the remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and ribs, and vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are saved according to various conditions, when the arrow does not strike an artery, or a nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may understand about your treatment through it.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, beneath the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had struck him in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not obtain from it except a small end of it, with which it adheres to its shaft: and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no misfortune happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arab arrow, and it is one which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore, I cut above it between the two guides: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	Therefore I proceeded cautiously with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	Therefore, after thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut above the arrow: and I worked on it, and I extracted it: and he was healed, and no harm befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man in whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound was healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Therefore, after seven years, an arrow emerged at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman into whose belly an arrow had fallen, and the wound was healed over it, and the arrow remained within her.  And no change occurred in her condition, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, in whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound was healed, and it remained, causing him little pain: and many similar things to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I removed an arrow from the king's chief men, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already inclined slightly to the right side: and the entire arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	Therefore, I was called to treat him after the arrow's impact for up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Therefore, I found the arrow wound to be very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I therefore searched for it with a fine probe, and did not feel it: and indeed, he felt a prick and pain beneath his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	Therefore, I hoped that the prick was from the arrow's tip.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	Therefore, I plastered the area with a plaster possessing attractive and digestive properties, confident that the area would form an abscess and that I would see a sign of the arrow so that I could cut above it: and it did not happen in the area that there was an accident signifying that the arrow had struck the area.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore, I applied the plaster to it for many days: and no accident happened, and the wound healed meanwhile; and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore, I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it, I felt a thin arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the arrowhead appeared to us visibly; and I spent approximately four months with him during that time.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had been enlarged, and I was able to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to removal, I did not cease to refine and devise methods upon it, until one day I began to use properly made forceps, according to the form they will take at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the infirm man was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may set it as a rule and signification concerning what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed by the narrative; nor does that book encompass it, and a skillful craftsman compares the little with the much: and with what is present, with what is absent; and finds a new operation and a new instrument in the descent of foreign things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say, therefore, that arrows do not emerge from the members to which they are fixed, except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by traction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite of the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which emerges from where it entered is either an arrow progressing in a fleshy place, and is drawn out and emerges.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not yield to exit at the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary to leave it for some days, until the flesh that is around it putrefies, and its traction is eased, and its emergence.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly, if it is fixed in bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for some days, and repeatedly apply traction and motion every day until it emerges.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary to perforate around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow's path is widened.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then pull it and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	However, if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already progressed into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those accidents which I have described appear from the sick person, then refrain from pulling the arrow, and leave it, until its condition is equalized after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate to the sifach: and the sick person remains for a few days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him: then proceed in pulling the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	However, if it is fixed firmly, and does not yield to you for extraction: then apply a drill around the arrow, as I have told you: then treat the place, until it is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however the arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sight, then seek it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If however you feel it, then pull it out with certain instruments suitable for its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If however you cannot get at it, due to the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then enlarge upon it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If however there are ears to which it is attached, then free the flesh fixed to them from every side, by every method you can, and try, if it cannot be released by breaking the ears and twisting them, until it escapes.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps, to all parts, until you make it escape: and be subtle to the utmost subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot get at it within one hour, then leave it for several days, until those things surrounding it putrefy.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try again: for it will then be easier.  However, if a flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we have said about treatment in its chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And use all the means possible for the escape of the arrow: and let it be with ease and calmness, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary, that when you pull the arrow, you make it weak according to the form in which the arrow was wounded.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more helpful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If, however, that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	However, if an arrow emerges from the opposite side of the other, either something already proceeds from it outwards, or the arrowhead creates a bump on the skin's surface above, and you see it protruding: therefore, cut above it, and let the cut be according to the size that the forceps can grasp.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it: for it will then be easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	However, if it remains embedded in the bone, then twist your hand in a circular motion until the arrow presses against the bone, and widens the space for itself; then pull it.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not, leave it for a few days; then try it again until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow's wood is embedded in it, then push it out along with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	However, if the wood has broken off and you wish to administer a push, then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then push it out with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow is concave, then push it with an instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is relieved by it.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut away all the flesh in which the poison is, if that is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with whatever is appropriate for it.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side; and it is close to what you are touching with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it; then cut, and beware of cutting a vein, or a nerve, and pull it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then sew the wound, if you see it, and treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the extremities be like the beak of a bird, made of iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many forms are made from them, large, and small, and medium, according to the quantity of the arrow's size, and its smallness, and the breadth of the wound, and its constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of the concave pusher.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the deaf pusher.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the deaf extremity, like a ray, so that its entrance into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be driven with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of this concave pusher is concave like a bird's feather, so that the entrance of the arrow into it and its impulse may be eased.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter XCVII.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	Thirty veins are those to be opened, whose use runs through the body.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which appear in the two temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, called the Looking veins; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the extremity of the nose.

¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	Phlebotomies of the two veins behind the ears are beneficial for chronic colds, and hemiplegia, and headache, and bad old ulcers of the head.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is according to what I relate.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is, that the patient's head be shaved, and his occiput be rubbed in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth by good rubbing.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then let the patient tie his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark that spot with ink.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take a phlebotomous knife, and it is called the cutting one.

Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And already in the beginning of the book was the incision of them, and the cauterization of them.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	On the phlebotomy of two arteries in the temples.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.

Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	Let the sick person hold their neck tightly, until two veins appear clearly to the eye; and let their pulse be evident under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then mark the spots with ink.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then, lift the skin above the vein upward with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upward.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it, as you did in the other two veins: and cause blood to flow according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then loosen the constriction of the sick person, and place your finger over the vein for one hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Afterwards, place a poultice and pads on it, and tighten it firmly over the constriction; and leave it until it is healed.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	And already the remembrance of them, and their incision, and their extraction, has preceded at the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	Of phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.

Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	The sick man tightens his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	Then take the instrument which is called Fossorium.
Cuius haec est forma.	Its form is this.

Place the prominent point which is on the head of the Fossorium over the vein itself, and strike it with a comb, or with something else in its manner: and let the blood run according to the amount that you wish.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then loosen the wound of the sick person, and bind it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotome.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it should not be a phlebotome with a sharp tip, like the other phlebotomes, but rather with a wide tip.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And open it with the phlebotome across the vein; since the bone is close by, and perhaps the phlebotome will break when it is slender.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	Concerning the opening of the veins in the two tear ducts.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	The benefit of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes is for the eye from scabies and redness; and swelling in the eye, and diseases of the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that it tightens the weak neck with a bandage.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	Then open them with the phlebotome, and you be standing over its head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	And let the phlebotomy be performed across, slightly lengthwise, with a small, somewhat broad phlebotome, for there is no flesh in the place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	For if the phlebotome is of a slender extremity, perhaps it will break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	Then make the blood flow out as much as you need.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	And place a compress over them, and bind them for one night, and unbind them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the Nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	Phlebotomy of the veins of the Nose is beneficial in acute fevers, and violent headaches, and diseases of the face, such as migraine, and redness that occurs in the face, especially when it is chronic.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the infirm person tightens their neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long lancet, and insert it into the middle of his nostril, between that which separates the nose according to its straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Because the vein is not apparent to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And you should hold your hand with the lancet for a short time, and make blood flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then tie it with one bandage.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	For it is quickly restored.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of Guidegi.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	The phlebotomy of Guidegi's two veins is helpful for constriction of breath, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and evil ulcers, and those that corrode, that is, eruptive herpes.

Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	Then do likewise with the other vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Afterwards, loosen the bandage, and bind the two veins with a middle constriction, so that the sick person is not choked.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And leave it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	For the wound is healed.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	Concerning the phlebotomy of veins by Algeberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	The veins, according to Algeberich, are helpful in phlebotomy, because they contribute to alchol in the mouth, and the corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and the fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those which are in the nose and in its surroundings.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of phlebotomy of them is, that you should make the infirm person sit before you, and bind his neck with a cloth.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then, roll back his lip, and look at the two veins: one is on the right of the lip, and the second on its left; and the demonstration of both is through the blackness of both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And that is true, because around them are small, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore, cut each one with a cut proceeding.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If, however, there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then aim at the incision of the larger of them, and the more evident.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do concerning the two veins which are in the upper lip; and indeed custom runs much with it; and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Concerning phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after the phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is for the suffocations which are in the throat, and the ailment of the uvula, and the ailments of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of phlebotomizing them is such that the infirm person sits between your hands in the presence of the sun; and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein; and the colour of each of them slopes towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore phlebotomize each of them; and be careful not to extend your hand too far in phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under it are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins, however, which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those in whose phlebotomy a custom has run throughout all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by piercing with a broad myrtle phlebotom, or by making an incision small enough to be considered a groove, or by cutting with a knife phlebotom, and that is the Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	So Alnesil is that which is suitable for the incision.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are broad and narrow varieties, according to the width and constriction of the veins. The form of the myrtle phlebotom should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, large veins, and those containing thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotom is of smaller width, and with finer extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Of the phlebotomy of the Basilica vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilica vein, which is one of these three veins, is a help to phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from illnesses that are under the throat and neck, from there following the chest, and the stomach; and it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when phlebotomizing it, to be cautious, and to be above fear from it, for there is an artery under it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If, therefore, he errs and adds in the phlebotomist's puncture, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary, that he not phlebotomize it with a phlebotomy-piercing instrument; rather, let him cut with a lancet.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the Basilica vein is not clearly visible, then it is necessary to seek another vein, and to change to another, or to look for one of its branches; or to phlebotomize the brachial vein instead.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is indeed obvious, and cut it with the phlebotomist's lancet, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If, however, you wish to phlebotomize the same vein, then it is necessary first to constrict the arm, so that you touch the spot until you recognize the pulse location.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with ink, thereafter the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the phlebotomist's lancet, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware that the incision does not fall a space from the artery's location.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, inflation in the spot you marked with ink, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore, avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood at the phlebotomy leaping out, like a child's urine, and it is thin, red blood, then know that it is from arterial blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then quickly place your finger over it for a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore blood is cut (for it is often cut), then tighten the arm and release it, and let the sick person beware of movement of it, and let fear be upon him.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not move it for several days until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If however the blood is not cut, and it conquers you, and there is no medicine present for you in your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities contract, and blood is cut.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of the fig tree, and split it; take one half, and tie it over the place of the vein with a proper tightening, with bandage and dressings until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not, then treat it with that whose previous mention was from the place of powders that cut off the flow of blood; and the excision of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, due to the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the Fusca vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	Phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is helpful, as it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilic vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it befits the phlebotomist that there be caution in his phlebotomy thereof, for beneath it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If, therefore, the phlebotomist adds in the puncture, and finds a nerve, there arises numbness in it, and the healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle and does not show itself, then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy such that you phlebotomize the section with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then divide the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is beneficial, because it draws blood from the head, and is helpful in eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you will, to phlebotomize it by pricking with an olive-wood phlebotome, or with a myrtle-wood phlebotome, because it is the safest of all veins, since there is no artery, nor nerve, beneath it.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is appropriate for you in phlebotomy to avoid striking the head of the muscle with the phlebotome, and to seek a gentler spot; and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first strike, so that it may be repeated with phlebotomy several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps it may become inflamed in some people when not phlebotomized in the first strike, but that inflammation does not harm it in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy, and its accompanying occurrences, concerning which you must consider its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First, you should know that phlebotomy is not performed except in the preservation of health, and its persistence, and as a precaution against the approach of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that phlebotomy is performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Fusca, and the Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And phlebotomy is to be performed in the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in the true spring and summer, and in Autumn and Winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And phlebotomy should be performed on the first, or on the third day, after three hours have passed.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, phlebotomy performed in illnesses does not have a specific time; but when necessity and suitability for it arise, in the night, or the day, and in every hour, and in all time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should the elderly be bled who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled, regardless of the reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels beforehand with a gentle clyster, if there is a great deal of retained stool, so that the veins do not draw putrid, harmful superfluities from the intestines to the principal members during the bleeding.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient suffering from nausea, or one who is surfeited, or one recovering from intoxication be bled, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor should a sick person with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And bleeding should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, frequent intercourse, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that weakens the body's or animal's strength.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with foods, drinks, and medications; if it is possible for him to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him; or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood may become thinner.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third day, as we have said; and strive that his chest be evacuated that day from all evil animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear; and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and superfluity of intercourse, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him have present in his seat things with which the custom of men has run in their use: from aromatics, and scents, and festivities and similar things by as much possibility as possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit upon a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one undergoing phlebotomy; afterwards, let the phlebotomist pull out his arm and rub it with his hand twice or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then bind the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, because when the constriction is unequal, or excessive in the constriction, then it hinders the flow of blood; or in its loosening, it also hinders the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the one undergoing phlebotomy rub their hands together until the veins swell and are evident to the senses.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist should wipe the incision with a little old oil, properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his left index finger lightly on the vein itself, under the spot where he intends to make the incision, so that the vein does not move away and the incision is not missed.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because some veins are like a fleeing chord during phlebotomy: and some are full of airiness; and when you place the incision on them, they contract under the incision, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the incision does not open the vein; and if he does open it, it is narrow.  Therefore, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should withdraw the incision.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein opens at once, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it another time slightly below or above that place with haste, if the place is not already inflamed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If, however, it becomes inflamed, or the patient weakens, then let him rest for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps it will attract a hot inflammation.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should he enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he should repeat the phlebotomy, if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough of the desired quantity will be removed from the blood, then repeat the phlebotomy in the same opening, straight on, and add a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it quickly, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place occurs in many people with a minor operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat it on it at all, for it will not excuse anything in your eyes.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something of the dregs of oil upon it, because it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies, through which phlebotomies veins at the prohibition of the flow of blood: and the Tyrians, Alfarach, and Sagzenea do it, when one of them is placed on the site.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is made thinner and resolved, when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If a large abscess occurs at the site of the phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist except on that occasion, or if the opening of the vein is small, then quickly place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed for a short time, on the site, and compress it for an hour, because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary to do this after the blood has exited the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If some blackness or greenness remains at the site after a few days, it does no harm: and if you wish, place some dissolved aloe or myrrh on it, or something from the juice of mint, that is, of calamint or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And very often abscesses and prominences occur at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore, place your hand upon it; then, if you find softness upon your compression of it, then that prominence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, beware to put something upon it from that which we said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster to it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it turns red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then let it go out until it becomes thin; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the vein's phlebotomy be enlarged and the phlebotomist be wide; and in one who is weak, it should be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow; and better that is administered in vein phlebotomy is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is safe from blood flow and from nerve incision; and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom fainting is accustomed to occur during bloodletting, it is necessary that he eat beforehand a little bread soaked in pomegranate-seed water, or secaniabin, if it is heated; and extract from his blood in three or four stages.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take beforehand bread soaked in the syrup of miua, or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or in aromatic scented syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If fainting occurs during bloodletting, and the cause of it is the excessive outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he drink water of meat, and a subtle scented syrup; and use aromatics with algalia, and let his chest be lined with it; and let him use the rest that we have said in the division on fainting in the chapter on evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	However, whoever wants to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time, it is necessary for one whose bloodletting is due to much evacuation and whose strength is weak, to release the blood gradually according to their strength in successive days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	However, whoever wants to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time, and whose body is strong, then let them do it after seven or nine hours from their first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from their body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary that they be evacuated on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body, however, there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causing fever to occur, it is necessary that blood depart from it in one turn, and a great quantity be drawn out of it; and the opening be enlarged until fainting occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and so that you place your hand upon his pulse at the passage of the blood, lest death occur in place of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For it often happens that, when the bloodletter does not know, and negligence falls.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not appropriate, when you wish to release the arm and release blood a second time, when the vein's opening is already closed and the blood's exit is difficult, to press upon it forcefully and quickly extend or flex it.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is very bad; indeed, leave it until it is bled a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with sharpness the clotted blood from the vein's opening, and place some dissolved salt in water upon it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place upon it something from tyriaca alfaroch or sagzenea, and apply gentle pressure until blood emerges.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If however the vein is already suppurated, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If necessity provokes you to draw blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either bleed the patient above that place or in another vein of another arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The arm's vein, however, is bled at the location of the Fusca and Basilica veins, if these are not found, and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the bloodletting is such that the patient should immerse their hand in warm water until the skin reddens and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it should be tied above it with a ligature of moderate tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then bleed along the vein's transverse direction gradually, not laterally, nor longitudinally: and let the opening be wide, and let your incision for the bloodletting be above the joint of the hand for a short while.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the flow of blood is hindered, then again immerse the hand in warm water, and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your desired outcome.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	However, if you are in the days of summer, then you may refrain from repeatedly immersing the hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed, the flow of blood is mostly placed in warm water during the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And bloodletting of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Bloodletting of the Saluatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its bloodletting is such that you should tie the mahason of the hand with a ligature, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly evident to the senses.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then cut the vein across.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it entirely, it will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful not to sever your hand with the lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood clots in the vein's opening and is prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have extracted the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt upon the vein: so that it does not quickly solidify.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly it is necessary to do with every constricted branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it is helpful for ailments of the spleen; and similarly do in its phlebotomy, as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of saphenous phlebotomy is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the uterus, and the retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys, and old sores of the hips and legs, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the method of his phlebotomy is that the sick person should put his foot in warm water, and do friction upon it, until the veins are prominent; and tie above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the vein's location is near the heel, appearing towards the toe; and from it branches many branches on the front of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or at the heel in its aggregation, because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you phlebotomize it on the front of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are under it on the front of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy, by which you phlebotomize it transversely, as if you wish to cut it; and let the phlebotomist be Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If, however, the outflow of blood is prohibited, then repeatedly immerse his foot in warm water; and let the blood run into it, until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then he should repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the Saphena of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The Sciatic vein's location, as we said, is at the heel on the wild side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the relief of phlebotomy is for it, for the pain of the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should enter a bath and hurry; and he should bind his leg from the side of the hip up to the heel by four fingers with a long thin strip: for it does not appear except because of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	Therefore, when it appears, then let the phlebotomist cut it according to whatever skill is possible to you, either transversely; and it is better, or to cut it with an incision, or to divide it by a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If, however, you do not find it, and it does not appear at all to the senses: then let the phlebotomist cut some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear; and beware of nerves, and make the blood flow in the quantity you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the constriction, and place a skin over the phlebotomy site, and bind the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Concerning cupping, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cupping is done from horns, and from air, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And cupping indeed is done according to two methods.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification, and the extraction of blood; and the other is cupping without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or indeed it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And cupping which is administered with scarification and the extraction of blood are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is, cupping of the Alnocrati, and it is the last of the head: and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck: and cuppings of the Alhagdahim, and they are two sheets of the neck on both sides together: and cuppings of the mentum, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and cuppings of the two shoulder blades: and cuppings of the Alachosos on the end of the tail: and cuppings of the two armpits, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and cuppings of the two thighs: and cuppings of the two calves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And cupping indeed does not extract blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that no virtue is lost from them, as is the case with venesection.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should cupping, whether with fire or without fire, be administered in any illness arising from fullness until the whole body is emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity prompts cupping from illness or because of custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is because there are people who, when blood multiplies in them until they need its extraction by cupping, experience heaviness and a feeling of pressure in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them are those who experience fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them are those who experience itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them are those who scratch the site of their cupping.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them are those whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue becomes ulcerated and they spit blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them are those whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them are those who see in their dreams blood and redness, and slain persons, and wounds, and things similar to them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the third middle of the month, we order the application of a wind instrument to be made after two or three hours have passed during the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that it contributes to relieving heaviness in the head and what flows to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is necessary that it be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this cupping is in the place of a cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted for one of cold temperament, or in whom there is catarrh, to use it.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that, it is not fitting that the elderly and those with cold ailments of the head use it.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever becomes assiduous upon it, forgetfulness is generated in him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of that, you should instruct the surgeon to withdraw his hand with the wind instrument a little lower, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	The use of a wind instrument, or Alkehel, is in the place of phlebotomy of the foot, and phlebotomy of the basilica vein, and therefore benefits asthma, and shortness of breath, and the fracture of the instrument for breathing, and coughing, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the wind instrument Alkehel be propelled somewhat, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The use of the alhagdahim wind instrument benefits accidental headaches, and ophthalmia, and migraine, and perforation, and toothache; and it is in the place of phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you instruct the surgeon not to press his hand with the scarification, so that he does not cut an artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	The use of a wind instrument under the chin benefits sores in the mouth, and gum disease, and similar diseases of the mouth; and it is in the place of phlebotomy of the alieherich, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The use of spatulas benefits alchafacham, which is caused by reflux and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The use of the wind instrument on the inner parts of the two focuses benefits the phlebotomy of the three veins, the Basilica, and Fusca, and Cephalica, because it draws blood from all the small veins in the flesh, and those small veins draw from other larger veins until the extraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the surgeon not to proceed too far in the scarification, because the area is denuded of flesh, and nerves and arteries are beneath it.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The cupping instrument applied to alchausos benefits hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper to use a large, air-filled cupping glass, because the area needs strong suction, and perhaps the delicate cupping glasses break; and let it be scarified with a large incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Cupping of the legs produces significant reduction, because they draw blood from the entire body, and they benefit old pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; they induce menstruation and benefit bothor and ademenul; and they stand in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of alhorcobeni cupping is close to the benefit of cupping the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of cupping placement is to apply an initially empty cupping glass and to draw with moderate suction; and do not prolong the cupping placement, but apply them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the fluids come to the location with equal arrival; and do not cease repeating this and continuing it, until you see the location already reddened and inflated, and the redness of blood appears; then scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For whoever is of tender flesh, of rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, no more, so that the location is not ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the cupper to enlarge the scarification slightly, and deepen it slightly; and to moderate the suction with ease, speed, and smooth movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Indeed, in the first instance, a path is opened to the thinning of the blood and its becoming watery; and in the second, indeed, to the careful examination of the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If, however, the blood is very foul, then let the scarification be done a third time, so that the final result may be achieved.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or a little bit, one scarification is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish for the extraction of much blood, we scarify with many scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification; and the equal limit in the scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which must be administered from oils at the position of Cupping, and what should the cupper beware of?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary that the cupping places be anointed with opening, softening, dissolving oils: if it is in summer, such as alkeiri oil, or violet oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or sarbatin oil, and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If however the superfluity is thick, cold: then the oil should be amaracin oil, or balsam oil, or alben oil, or anise oil, and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If however the cupper has large pores, soft flesh: then it is necessary that he refrain from oil, and it is necessary that these wash the cupping places afterward with rose water, or with cold water, or with soothing water, or with pumpkin water, or with purslane water, and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of much moisture, should wash the cuppings with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac, and similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	However, whose superfluities are thick, let him wash his cuppings with old wine, or with sorrel water, or with anise decoction, or camomile, and similar to them.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary to be cautious about cupping in the bath, or in the vicinity of the bath; indeed, it is necessary to administer it after exiting the bath by an hour, or by two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that someone sleep after cupping.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that cupping, or bloodletting, should be governed by before cupping?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after it, it is necessary, firstly, to consider: then, if the cupped or bled person is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation overcome his blood: then it is necessary that he take cooling things, such as pomegranate juice, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and iuleb, and similar to them.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put his food as poultry, and the meats of sheep sekebiget, and foods seasoned with agrimony; and similar to them.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whoever's complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds; and let him take medium fragrant wine, which is between old and new; and it is prescribed that he use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put his food as poultry, and canary birds, and sparrows, that is, small birds, and young pigeons issiadebet.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting be more than the food; and it is necessary that in some men, a tyriaca alfaroch, or a medicine of musk, that is, musk, or alesselithe be given in drink before cupping, and before bloodletting, or after, so that the main members might be strengthened, and the blood be refined.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary that they take it in heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Concerning cupping without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	However, cupping without scarification is cupping that is applied to the liver, and spleen, and gout, and to the stomach, navel, and kidney area, and the hip joint; since these members do not tolerate scarification upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And they are not sought out for anything except either the drawing of blood from a member to another member; just as we place cupping on the breasts in illness of a nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to relieve cold, viscous windiness in a member; such as placing a cupping on the stomach and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it indeed rarefies the member and warms it, and removes the pain because it has dissolved that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed on the kidneys, when obstruction or stone occurs in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by its power of suction perhaps it opens the obstruction or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it does when placed on the liver and spleen, regarding the windiness to be treated in both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these cupping glasses are administered empty with only a cut.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in cases of pleurisy, and that is so that the cupping glass is filled, and is large, with just warm water, or water in which herbs suitable for the condition have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Form of a cupping glass administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let its opening be the width of two open fingers, as we have formed it; and let its depth be half a palm; and let there be a small hole on its side, roughly in the middle of it, of a size such that a needle can enter it. Let it be made of bronze or brass, with thick, smooth, even, and polished edges, so that it does not injure the limb on its placement upon it; and let there be a cross-bar of bronze or iron in its middle, where the candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this cupping glass is made large, larger than the one we have described, and a little smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the cupping glasses of children and thin people are different from the cupping glasses of men and those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The method of placing this cupping glass with fire on the limb is to light a wick with fire from linen properly, or a small candle of wax; and place it over the middle of the cross-bar which is in the middle of the cupping glass; so that the fire is burning approximately at the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the body of the sick person is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed on the limb; and a finger is placed over the hole I mentioned, until, while holding the cupping glass, as needed, we remove the finger, and vapor will exit through that hole, and the cupping glass will immediately release.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the wick according to its method, and repeat it, if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in a cupping glass used in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no cross-bar, nor a hole; and it is not administered unless because it is filled with water, and placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger this cupping glass is, so that it can hold a lot of water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Concerning the suspension of leeches.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter Ninety-nine.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Leech applications are not administered in many places, unless in those parts of the body where the application of cupping is not possible, due to their small size, such as the lip, the gums, and similar areas.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a limb denuded of flesh, such as the finger, the nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: to obtain leeches which are in fresh, clean waters, free from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be kept in fresh water day and night, until they are hungry and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should first be evacuated by bloodletting and cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the sick limb until it is red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place them upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled, fall, and suction of the area with a cupping device is possible, then it is most helpful; and if not, then wash the area with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, it should be rubbed and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood after the fall of the Sanguisugarum is prolonged and is oozing, then dip a linen cloth into cold water and place it over it until the oozing is stopped.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then powder crushed zegi, or gallnuts, and similar astringents, on it, until the blood stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place the halves of peeled beans on the area and leave them until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood is stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And if a repetition of Sanguisugarum is necessary, when possible, change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If, however, leeches are prevented from suspension, then the area is wiped with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or stick a needle into the places, until something comes out from the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them, for they themselves, when they feel something of the blood, adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish them to fall off, pulverize something of ground aloe, or salt, or ashes, upon them: and they will fall off immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A universal discourse on restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of Medicine, and is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O Children, that the foolish physicians and the common people boast of this chapter, and those who have never examined the books of the ancients, nor read a letter from them.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, this method is private among the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never encountered any good in it at all, and I have not acquired from it that which I have acquired except because of the length of reading the ancient books, and the study on the understanding of them, until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experiment and study for the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from it in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge: and upon which my experiment has passed, after I have abbreviated it for you, and delivered it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it by the end of abbreviation, and shown it at the end of declination: and I have formed in it many shapes from the shapes of instruments that are administered in it, since it is from the addition of declination, as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections concerning the existence of bone fractures, from those that are necessary prerequisites before we begin to recount the fractured members, and various ones, if any.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we say in the prologue of this chapter, that the summaries and chapters, the understanding of which the craftsman is first required to achieve, to stand upon their truth; namely, so that you, and those who are ready, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	Therefore, I say that when a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or fall occurs to someone, then it is necessary, first of all, to apply bloodletting to him, and to release him, or both at once, if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of strength; or if the person affected is a child, or an infirm old man; or if the time is one of intense heat, or intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content in his food, with cold vegetables, and the flesh of birds and kids; and forbid wine, and heavy meats, and filling himself with foods and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are secure from a hot abscess, and do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb; then let the sick man return to his first regimen with which his custom ran.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	Therefore, when the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing foods, with much, heavy, thick nourishment, in which there is viscosity; such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish; and heavy wine, and things similar to these.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen, the coagulation of the fracture is made more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in early old age and decrepit, it is not possible that they be continuously joined and consolidated according to their own nature always, because of the dryness of their limbs; and those that are in them are consolidated and joined at the end of their leniency, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature attaches something to the broken bone from every side, similar to glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds it, until they are glued together and bound together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was in the beginning, until nothing hinders it from its operations; and for this reason it is necessary that you place the nourishment of the sick person with foods in which there are heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that fractures are of diverse kinds, according to the diversity of the limbs: for the fracture of the leg is different from the fracture of the skull; and the fracture of the breastbone is different from the fracture of the spine; and likewise all the other limbs are different from each other; and I have come with a recollection of every kind of fracture, explained in its own chapter, distinct from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the kinds of bone fractures are also diversified within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because a fracture of it occurs in an arched shape, besides which splinters happen in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes its fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and its fractures are splintered, that is, splinters, and proceeding additions, such as are in a reed when it is sharpened with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head; and there is a fracture with a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every type has a particular disposition, or instrument, for its restoration, according to which its recollection will come, distinct in its own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from what is recognized as a bone fracture, there is its twisting, and its own prominence; and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the place, nor sound upon touching it with your hand while you touch the bone with agitation, nor does the infirm person find great pain there, then there is no fracture there, but it is possible that there be a twisting or a small fissure; therefore, you should not move it with your hand and compression entirely, but rather place upon it from medicines, whose recollection comes, after that moment which is appropriate to the place; then a thin bandage is applied.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when a place is bent and split in two, besides the struggles which happen in it, nevertheless each part is removed from its mate; then it is necessary for you to begin at your own time to rectify it, by making it even before a hot abscess happens to it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If however a hot abscess happens to it, then leave it for a few days until the abscess subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then make it even according to any method possible by gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and its straightening are easier than the bone, in which struggles occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to its remembrance will come to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If however there are struggles in the bone, then an extension of this broken limb is necessary from two parts, if it is a hand or foot; or with your hand, if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb upon an equal place, according to its natural shape, until when the broken parts of the limb are extended; then strive to return those additions to their places with all your skill and in any way possible; and beware, according to your strength, that through your operation no pain or harm befall the weak; and strive, according to your strength, to apply one of the two bones with its mate, according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time to try and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see anything different there, rectify it and equalize it according to the extent of your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of violent extension and strong compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many times, through their operations, they cause a hot abscess or contraction in the limb; as we have already seen it from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then, after equalization and proper operation, and constriction of that limb, and rest and tranquility, advise the sick person about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And have him beware that he does not move it during his waking hours, and his sleep at his turning, and his stirring, and his defecation, and all his movements with all his strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he beware, lest the position of the limb be one which will follow with pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels pain or injury in the position of the limb, then it is necessary that he change it to another position in which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And take care with him that his position is even and straight, so that twisting does not occur in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fracture of the limb is, according to what I relate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured limbs are diversified in their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, those of them that are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the foot, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, thin cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	However, those of them that are large, such as the thigh and the leg, it is necessary that there be in them a broad, hard wrapping.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because a broad ligament connects a large limb and binds it from every side with an equal constriction, so that no spot enters it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after your evacuation, begin to place on it a suitable liniment, in soft linen, over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage over the place of the fracture itself in three or four wrappings, according to what the limb deserves: and draw your hand a little with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then proceed with it towards the upper part from the place of the fracture, and bind less tightly than your previous binding of the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then move away with the wrapping from the place of the fracture a little, and gradually loosen the constriction until you obtain a large amount from a healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another strip, and wrap it again over the fractured place with wrappings.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards proceed with the wrapping towards the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your procedure in the tightness of the wrapping, and its loosening, be according to what we have said in the first, upper wrapping.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the wrappings soft tow, or cloth, with which the twist of the fracture is equalized, if there is twist in it: and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another strip over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards, immediately place properly made stars over these wrappings, if there is no swelling in the place, nor a hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If however there is swelling in it, or an abscess: then place on it that which will sit on that abscess, and remove the swelling; and leave it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind the stars over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars be from the halves of broad reeds, shaved and cleverly formed; or let them be from the wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or from gerard, that is, from palm branches, or from calingi; and let the width of each star, according to this form and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the star placed over the wound itself be somewhat thicker and wider than the other stars; and the length of the star should be according to what is permitted by the member's size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind over the stars with another bandage, according to the same first binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind over it with threads properly, according to what we said about the binding: and let your binding be over the fractured place more; and the further away it is from the fracture, the less the binding.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the middle threads be of medium thickness and thinness, and be of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the operation of foolish men who place their threads made from twisted linen cords, this is a great error; because the binding falls with them outside the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And again, thin threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve by the binding with them what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth between stitch and stitch.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the patient is injured by the ends of the stitches after the binding in healthy areas, then place under them soft tow, or dyed wool, until nothing is injured by it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	However, when there is a fracture with a wound, and a rupture occurs in the skin, I will come with a recollection of it in the second chapter according to its particularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken limb needs to be bound with stitches from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is because when the limb is large, you should not place stitches upon it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety regarding the outcome of a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters, with which the ancients restored those that are placed upon a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	Method of an abbreviated common plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children, since it is from that which is not overcome by heat nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, that you should take from the mill's powder, and it is the flour's marrow which hangs in the mill's walls at the grinding of the millstone: and make it as it is, except that you sieve it with the white of an egg: and place its confection not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of plaster, restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almonds, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugath; and juice of all, ana 10 scruples; myrrh, and aloes, both ana 5 scruples; and alethilic 20 scruples. Grind all, and sieve, and mix with alethilic water; or with the white of an egg, if the patient's complexion is inflamed.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plaster, which also benefits fracture and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugath, and almonds, and white marshmallow root, of all, ana 10 scruples; myrrh, and aloes, both ana 5 scruples; acacia 6 scruples; Armenian bole 20 scruples. Grind all with much trituration, and sieve, and make into a paste with water, or the white of an egg; and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places; and it relieves the pain that occurs to them, and the cracking of the bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take fresh wool, and immerse it in vinegar, and boiled oil; and place it on the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good in quieting a hot abscess; and it expels pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Method of plaster, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of the wild fig, and leaves of the wild poppy: and grind them all together, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Method of a shortened plaster, administered in the restoration of a broken bone; and when you wish resolution of a remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take of the root of marshmallow, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and herb flour, of each one part:  grind them all together, and mix them with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is inflamed, then make it with water of moist coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Method of another stronger plaster in resolution, than this first, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take of marshmallow root, and flaxseed, and pomegranate fruit, and melilot, and sorrel, and violet flowers, and chamomile, of each one part; grind them all together, and mix them with willow water, or with fresh water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of that according to the warmth of the limb, and the rest of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything should be placed upon a fractured limb during its restoration except a poultice made from wax and oil: nothing else; and he narrated that it should be of a consistency between thickness and thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	However, Galen thought that things should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration that have a drying effect on heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and frankincense, and similar things to those which we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of the plaster which is beneficial for injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugwort, and chickpeas, and the hairs of a man's head, cut off, or the feathers of a bird, and marshmallow, and salt in equal parts: grind them, and sift them, and mix them: and make a plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The amount of time, however, for which the bandage should remain, and then be loosened, is that you should consider, if no pain, nor itching, occurs to the patient, nor is the broken bone moved from its place: then do not loosen it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if intense itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in that place: then hasten, and loosen it in an hour, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, moist: and immerse it in warm water, and wash the place with it, until the itching subsides, and the pain ceases.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then allow the limb to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place upon it cut wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it above for one night, until you are certain of avoiding a hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then apply again a fine bandage and a small plaster: and do not tighten it with your first constriction, and be subtle with it, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all the other afflictions have completely disappeared, and you no longer need plaster and bandage, then treat it again as you did at first, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing of what we have said happens to the limb, then do not loosen it until after three, or four, or five, or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it has been left for twenty days, according to what appears to you from the loosening of the limb, as we have said, until when the fracture adheres and the flesh's coagulation approaches it: then add even more to your original bandage and also increase the dressing of the weak nourishment, according to the previous mention of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If, however, you see the fracture site already drying out and weakening more than necessary, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, apply warm water to it every time you loosen it, and let it be there for all three days, and lessen the bandage somewhat.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, therefore, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	However, what foolish restorers do in the case of a broken limb a second time, when it is not restored the first time as it should be, and is restored according to a twisting, is an error in their practice and a great fear.  And if it were correct, the ancients would have written about it in their books, and would have practiced it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have seen no trace of it at all in those texts, and it is better not to do it.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Concerning the accidental injury to the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The types of fracture are diverse, and its shapes are numerous; and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture that occurs from a blow with a sword; and the blow removes the bone completely as far as it reaches the siphac, which is beneath the bone, just as an axe does in wood; and because of that, this type of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword cuts some part of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the incision does not penetrate to its end; and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, a lifting absolutely.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture, which is a crushing or abrasion; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall upon a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which is now approaching the membrane that is under the bone, or it is on the surface of the bone; and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture, which is hidden within the bone to the fineness of a hair; and it is a small fissure, and because of that this type of fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And of these is a fracture that happens from a fall, or a blow of a stone, and similar things, which cause a lamina of the bone to enter the interior, and a hollow space is made: just as happens with metal cauldrons, when a blow strikes them, and a part of them enters the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And most certainly this happens in the heads of moist bones, such as the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these types of fractures are dealt with separately, and I will come with a remembrance of it all in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these types of fractures by probing upon them, and investigating them with probes, and removing the corrupted flesh which is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	Indeed, the Capillary type is known by this, that it is detected upon the bone, and is scraped clean, and is smeared upon it with ink: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms: then, if you see from the symptoms that it signifies clearly an impending fear, such as vomiting of bile, extension, and loss of understanding, and loss of voice, and fainting spells, and acute fever, and protrusion of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar symptoms in various conditions, undoubtedly it will not be cured: and if you see symptoms that do not terrify you, and you hope for recovery, then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if a wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded, and it is during the winter days, then it is necessary that you strive in the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every arrangement.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is during the summer days, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the membrane is corrupted, and those accidents that we have recounted occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and is with fragments and grinding, then it is necessary to cut the broken and ground part, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is to shave the head of the wounded person, and expose the bone in whatever way is possible for you, and according to the shape of the wound, and what is easy for the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If during the exposure of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is to fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and to keep the wound at rest until the abscess subsides, and you are secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the treatment of the bone, and the removal of it.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is to cut the bone with a knife of sharp edge; and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then apply another knife, a little wider than the first knife; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then apply yet another knife, wider still than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you should have a number of different knives, some wider than others, and some shorter than others; and let their edges be sharp, and let them be of iron or steel; and use ease in striking the knife, so that it does not strike the head, and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If however the bone is strong, hard: then it is necessary to pierce around it, before you apply the knives, with drills called *Terebra non profundantia*; and they are not called this, unless because they do not pierce through the boundary of the fleshy bone to that which is behind it; because the drill has a round end above that which is under its sharp head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents it from sinking into and piercing the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take many of these drills, each one suited to the thickness of the bone, until you have a drill for every skull; whose sharp end's quantity in length and shortness should be according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three types of drills, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The method of piercing around the fractured bone is: to place the drill upon the bone, and to revolve it with your fingers, until you know the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another place, and place one between each hole, the size of the thickness of a radius, or approximately that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the chisels what is between each hole from the bone, and make it thinner than you can over it in fine lightness, as we have said, until you eradicate the bone, either with your hand, or with some other of those instruments which you have prepared for it: such as pliers, and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you guard against all caution, lest the drill, or chisel touch anything of the bone.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you have encircled the bone by piercing, and it has been separated from the bone, if it has been continuous with it, and you have drawn it out, it is necessary to smooth and make equal the extremity of that which remains in the bone with another instrument similar to a chisel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be thinner and more subtle than other chisels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If, however, there remains anything of the small bones, and splinters, then take them away with ease with what you have of your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound after that with the bandages and ointments that we have described.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, entirely free from fear, which Galen said, and praised greatly: and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	You must first begin to expose the part of the bone where the fracture is more severe and obvious, until when you have exposed that part, and placed the end of this lenticular chisel upon it, whose form is this.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part cuts nothing smoothly; and its pointed part, running lengthwise along its two sides, as you see: so that the lenticular part rests against the bone, its pointed face striking the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike the chisel from one side with a small mallet, until you cut the entire bone easily, as it is loosened; and you should be assured by the bandage that no accident happens in it that you fear at all.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not more foolish than men, and more ignorant of it, nor were asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the bandage in some places, he would cut it off with the end of its lenticular chisel, and free it from it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the bandage, and that which is cut away from the bone is its surface, and roughnesses and fine irregularities remain in it: then it is necessary that you smooth that roughness, and remove those irregularities with fine scrapers from which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that it may be possible for you to administer from them in every suitable place those that are most appropriate and straightest, according to that to which the operation leads you, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your judgment, by which you first scrape the bone, more broadly with those scrapers.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after it a finer one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do this according to continuity, until you arrive at administering the thinnest and finest of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small fissures, and fine fractures, it is necessary to administer care, according to that which leads to its straightening.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter not hidden above all to whomever has any study in this art, and has stood upon that which we have written and shown in the great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, a flap of skin is retained when you remove the bone, then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth; and do this as easily as you can on top of it, so that it is not burdened by this.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer a broad bandage over it; and do not tighten it, unless by an amount which only holds the wound together; and leave it with this treatment for one day, or two days, until you are certain of being free from a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it, and administer after it medicines with which superfluous dryness is overcome: such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and birthwort, and similar things to them; and it is that you should make from these medicines a powder, which is pulverized over the wound as they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer in it any medicine of whose property it is to cleanse, and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment is clean; neither be there dirt of ointment, nor filth.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor allow any venom to collect in it at all; for when venom collects upon the brain membrane, it corrupts it, and putrifies it, and a great harm comes upon the sick person afterward; and this happens in the head disease, when the mouth is cleansed from it, especially when its care is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider, if the accidents which we have mentioned occur to the sick person, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur, except from the medicine that is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness: then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and linen with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it upon the diseased area; afterward, treat it with the types of treatment that are appropriate, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter Four.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is broken only when two of its upper parts are broken simultaneously, or one of them: because it is composed of two bones; since its lower part is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and it does not suffer except from abrasion, and twisting, and crookedness.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts is broken, then you should insert a small finger into the nostril, and straighten that fracture with your index finger and thumb on the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And be careful that your treatment does not cause pain to the sick person.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it should be straightened with the end of a rod, on which a small thickness is placed.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in two parts, then do the same; and hasten its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, with the rest of a hot abscess.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a linen bandage, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two bandages if the fracture is in two parts; and let the thickness in the bandage be of such a quantity as to fill the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that bandages should be soaked in butter and changed daily.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	However, that does not seem to me, rather it is necessary that the bandage be soaked in egg white, mixed with mill dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the bandage until the bone is firm and the cartilage is hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose in place of a bandage, after a soft cloth is wrapped around it; and this is done so that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly and so that the infirm person is not prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do it; and if you wish, do bandages.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If, while treating a hot abscess, the nose should again become affected, apply a plaster to the nose with cerote, or with cotton soaked in rose oil, or with a little diachylon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If, however, a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary that you plaster it with sesame flour and powdered frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place soft lint over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If, however, the bones of the nose are broken or shattered, then it is necessary that you cut over them and extract them with instruments that are suited to them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then suture the wound and treat it with whatever heals and consolidates it from suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs between the nostrils, then it is necessary to treat it with bandages and administer a lead cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and its fracture is not with a wound: then consider if its fracture is only from the outside, and it is not broken in two, and bends inward: then its knowledge is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on its right side, insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and with it, push the bend of the fracture from inside towards the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone properly, and with it make it even.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to apply traction from both sides, according to its alignment, until its equalization is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however, it has already happened that the teeth are moved or broken: then bind those you hope to remain with gold, silver or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a poultice on the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a folded cloth over it, and place a large properly made compress over the cloth, or a piece of sole leather of equal length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it above, according to the manner in which its ligature is prepared and its application is suitable, until it is not broken; and command the sick person to use tranquility and quiet; and give him soft drinks as food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If however, you estimate that something of its form has already changed in any way: then hurry and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then rectify whatever is altered in it and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the poultice; and place soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that plaster remains attached to it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not loosen it, until it is healed, or the fracture is tightened.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often tightened in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If in the meantime a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times for its calming, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For if a piece is already separated from the bone, or from the splinters, then be subtle in this, that you remove those splinters with what suits you in removing them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If truly the wound opening is constricted, then enlarge it with a phlebotom knife according to the quantity of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then suture the wound opening, if it is wide; and if not, place over it from plasters which suit it, and cause it to heal, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the Furcula, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the Furcula is most often broken on the anterior part, on the humerus side, and its fracture occurs according to one of three methods.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Either it breaks and separates into two, besides which splinters may occur in it; and this is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or, such that splinters occur in the bone; and this is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or, such that it is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation for it when the fracture is without a wound is that you should have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the support that follows the fractured Furcula, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then align the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and there is neither a prominence nor a concavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then you should place a sphere of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit, and its size should be according to your need; and extend and elevate the Furcula, and compress the sphere with your hand, until you align the fracture as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot draw the extremity of the Furcula outward because it has reached a deep position, then the patient should be placed on their neck; and place a pillow of medium size under their shoulder, and the assistant should press the shoulder downwards until the bone of the Furcula that is deep is raised upward; and then straighten the fracture and align it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If, however, you feel a splinter from the Furcula, and it moves, then you should cut above it and extract the splinter with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If however it is retained in the bone, then make an incision into it with one of the scalpels you prepared for it, after you have placed under the Furcula the instrument that preserves the sifach: and the instrument is of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spoon that has no cavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that which you need of it from the size of the bone, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length, however, also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the rupture of the wound that you made when you extracted the piece of bone is wide, and you secure it from a hot abscess: then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the rupture is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the amount of the wound's fissure.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot abscess should occur, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it over it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A constriction of the bone, however, when it is without a wound and without an incision, is such that you should place a plaster on the bone made from mill flour with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place soft lint over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere beneath its protuberance, if you need that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a himematem, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long, and its width is one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled pad over the lint and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a stick from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the stick in the place of the alhimemati that falls on the fracture and place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the alhimemati over the fracture as it revolves, and wrap it around its neck, and under its healthy and under its unhealthy titillico: and reduce it over every part, and as you see that the constriction holds the fracture in a proper constriction: and it is that which is not hidden from you, and everything, so that the stick is not removed from above the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And therefore it is necessary that you observe the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Therefore, whenever the ligament softens, and you see the stick already being removed, then straighten it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sick person's sleep on their back, and place a small pillow under their side at their sleep, so that with it their support is raised from their side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, the fracture of the collarbone is lifted by lifting the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or tie his arm to his neck, and do not loosen the bandage if it does not happen in the place the accident happened because of itching, or from an abscess, up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see his face towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the constriction, and leave him until it is restored and congealed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed a fracture of the collarbone is tightened and strengthened in most cases within twenty-eight days; and sometimes it happens in certain people in a shorter time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the scapula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The scapula is rarely fractured, and in its broad area; and only its margins are broken from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	Therefore, when a part of it is fractured, and it is fractured in its middle, and this is not recognized except by touch, then, according to the nature of the fracture, attempt its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And restore it to its natural shape by all means of ingenuity possible to you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place on the area mill dust with egg white, and soft linen, and place on top a small cushion made of doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place on it a broad splint of thin wood, according to the size of the entire scapula, or a little larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If, however, there is a hollow under the splint in any part of the scapula, then fill that hollow with soft linen until the splint is level.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind over it with a long bandage, with suitable constriction and firmness of the splint, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Therefore, whenever the bandage softens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it moves from its place; and let the sick person lie on their healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the scapula is indeed restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is completed, then loosen the bandage; and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose junction is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however a piece of bone protrudes, and pierces under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said in the fracture of the furcula, from the subsidence of a hot abscess, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and that rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities are indeed broken and crushed very much from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle breaks, inclining downward, and a violent pain, and difficulty in breathing, and a cough occur; and perhaps he vomits blood, and a cavity in the broken bone is revealed, and is not hidden from sense, its restoration is that the weak man should lie on his back, and place a bolster between his shoulder blades.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and gather the ribs from both sides with your hands, and make them equal in their alignment, in every way possible and fitting, until the shape of the bone returns as it should.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and a bandage over it, and place a splint of thin wood, or willow, or similar light materials, on top of it, after wrapping it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then make it precise in tying it over the broken bone, so that it does not move: and proceed with the bandage around the back several times, and tighten it with a proper constriction.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then check the bandage every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it. And if its necessity prompts its removal because of itching, or corrosion that occurs in the area, or pain, or abscess: then promptly untie it, and remove the plaster, and rectify what has happened with its method of treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then replace the plaster, if you see fit: and apply a bandage to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	Concerning the restoration of Ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a rib fracture does not occur except in the thick areas that follow the spine, and from their extremities at the front.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And attrition does not occur in them unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from the sense in examination with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done so that one aligns the fracture with the fingers according to the possible way, until the shape is equal, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters, and bind the fractured bone with splints, if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is sloping inward, then a severe pain and a prickling sensation occur in the patient, like the prickling that occurs in someone with pleurisy, because the bone pricks the membrane, and he also experiences difficulty breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood; and this is a difficult condition to treat.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients were ingenious in this, with many methods; and among them are those who say that you should give the patient foods that generate inflammation and windiness, so that the belly will become inflamed and distended, and the fracture will be pushed outward.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We, however, abhor that a rapid cause of a hot abscess be made if it does not already exist.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If, however, it already exists, then add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let a windy substance be placed over the affected area, then sucked with force, and this is a similar line of reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the windy substance will draw superfluities to the affected area, because of the weakened condition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the area be covered with wool already soaked in hot oil; and cushions should be placed between the ribs until it is full, so that there is an even binding when you wrap it around the circumference.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, through food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If a violent condition constricts the patient, which he cannot tolerate, and the mouth is pricked or the covering is wounded by a puncture, and we fear for the patient, then it is necessary to cut over the area and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us place upon it the instrument that preserves the sifac, whose description preceded: and let us cut the bone with ease, and let us cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures; and let us treat it with plasters until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If, meanwhile, a hot abscess should occur, then hurry, and infuse poultices in rose oil, and place upon the area; and let the sick person be treated with what is appropriate for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, let him also lie on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured spine of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	A fracture of the neck bones sometimes occurs, and attrition rarely happens to them; and similarly to the vertebrae of the back as well.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether he will be healed or not, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and numb, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you grasp them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that he is not healed, and in most cases is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If he moves them, and feels the contraction with fingers and the prick, then know that the neck bone is sound, and that the sick person will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If a similar affliction affects the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether he will be healed or not, then consider his feet.  If you see that they are softened, and the same happens to them as to the hands; then, when he lies on his back, wind and excretion come forth involuntarily; and when he lies on his stomach, excretion comes forth involuntarily; and when he lies on his back and wants to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not labor in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If, however, nothing of that happens to him, the matter is less serious.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what happens from that is to try to soothe the hot abscess: thus, put rubbed rose oil on the vertebra alone; or with the yolks of roasted eggs.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place that upon it several times a day, until the hot abscess is soothed; then place one of the strengthening, drying plasters over the place, and bind it with a bandage; and prescribe rest and tranquility to the sick person.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the part where he finds pain until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If, however, it happens that the bone is rubbed raw, or something has already separated from it, then it is necessary to cut over the skin and remove that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some healing ointment until it heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If, however, the last bone of the alhausos is broken, and is the end of the tail, then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and to set the broken bone with the other hand, as far as possible, and with a second adjustment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place over it, and remove it; and treat the wound with the preceding treatment, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Concerning the restoration of the Anchae.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the Ancharum rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they do break, then their fracture is not, except for a shattering at their extremities; and they are split lengthwise, and are deflected inward; and pain occurs in the afflicted place, and a prickling; and the leg that breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is indeed that you extend your hand over it, until you stand upon the fracture as its shape is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at its extremities, then make that fracture equal, according to what is prepared for you from the equalisation, until its shape is made similar to its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If however the fracture is lengthwise, or already inclines inward, then make the infirm lie upon his stomach, until its fracture's restoration is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have made it equal, place a plaster over it; then place a splint of wood, or of leather, over it; and bind tightly above it, so that you need not fear the shifting of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And make the concavity of them equal with that which fills it, until the binding takes it according to equality; and command the infirm person to sleep upon their back, or upon their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If however a hot abscess occurs to him, then cease from its extension and its restoration, until the hot abscess subsides; and place upon it that which subsides it, according to what preceded; then return to its restoration; and bind it as is appropriate.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If however it happens in the bone of the satagie, or it is shattered, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the Adiutor.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The Adiutor is that which is between the elbow and the head of the Scapula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two bandages are tied at the two extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is hung from a raised place, and the sick person sits on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he shall place his broken arm upon the wood, until it reaches the notch, in the middle of which the curvature of the wood is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend something heavy above it, so that the attendant extends it downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician shall set the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns to its proper place.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that the sick person be laid supine on their neck, and suspend their hand from their neck with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two attendants, that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with their hands, and that the other hold below it, and that each of them extend it to their side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind below the fracture with a ligament, and above it with another ligament, and let each of the two attendants extend them to their own sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it is necessary that one ligament be placed below the armpit, and another below the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that a ligament be placed above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equalize the fracture with ease without exertion, until when the fracture is equalized as it should be, and a good application is applied; then bind it, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place over it wool cut into small pieces soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess subsides; then bind it; and the method of binding it is that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then let the arm be supported by the aid itself, and place his hand open over his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and bind the arm over the support, so that the arm stands in place like stars; if nothing hinders you from it, nor is anything from the broken bone disturbed upon you.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something from the broken bone may be disturbed upon you, then use splints; and it is that you place a splint over the fracture itself which is wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between each splint the width of a finger; and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the splints the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your bandage should be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is extended, the smaller the bandage should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the placement of the splints and the bandage, as we have said, in the hour that you restore the limb immediately, then do so; and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave the bandage and splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for all three days, that there not happen itching, or swelling, or the food be prevented from reaching the limb, on account of the disposition of superfluity of the bandage.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore rectify all that, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If however you are confident that nothing will come from that: then do not loosen the bandage, unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the sleep of the infirm person be upon his back, and his hands upon his stomach: and place beneath a supporting mattress full of wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day, that the broken limb shape is not loosened, or the bandage softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore rectify all that with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give the patient food according to the order we have previously described, so that the food is initially light, until his mouth begins to be strengthened: then it is necessary to increase the thickness of his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For by custom, the healing of the leg and foot is that it is strengthened in forty days; then, therefore, it is necessary that it be loosened, and a bath administered, and it be medicated with ointments that rectify it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul, bruised: then do not loosen the bandages and splints from it until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forearm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of which is small, and it is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is the one that is situated beneath the small one, at its lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore only the larger forearm bone is broken, or the smaller one, and perhaps both are broken at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller forearm bone is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the forearm bone is broken below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse than that is when the two bones are broken simultaneously.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm bone above, then it is fitting for the physician, in its restoration, to apply a small extension with ease, until he has made it even.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the larger forearm bone is the one that is broken, then it is necessary that he apply a much stronger bandage.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he apply a hand shape during its restoration, and a prolonged extension upon a cushion.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint be below all the fingers, or the rest; and let the patient sit squarely upon himself, and let the cushion be before him, or directly in front of him, at a height such that the patient does not incur fatigue.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the attendant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another attendant extend it from above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then let the physician equalize the bone until he restores it to the best shape he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If in the fracture of the bone there are fragments, then try to restore every fragment to its place by your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If however a separate fragment appears in it, and it pierces the skin, and you have no hope of restoring it: then cut over it, and remove it according to the manner that we have said in those that have been previously mentioned.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If however the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a special chapter about it, therefore take the treatment from that.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If however a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then line a cloth with a cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth over it with a thin bandage, until when the abscess subsides: then remove the cerate, and put a plaster prepared from mill powder with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place splints, and let the splint placed over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most arrangements, whether the fracture be in one or in two foci simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then apply your bandage to the site of the fracture more strongly and forcefully, and somewhat more with the bandage to the upper or lower part of the fracture: or apply a softer bandage to the one previously, according to what has preceded in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that wrap around the fracture be soft, moist cloths; and let them not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is tied be of linen proper, medium between thin and thick, as we have narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything happens that requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the limb, then it is necessary to embrocate the limb with heated water, until that itching ceases, and leave the limb unbandaged until it rests, then reapply the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage has already softened, and the bone has already been set, and similar things to these: then correct it all by your skill, and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of the superfluity of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and leave it for a few days, until nourishment flows to it, then bandage it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, nothing of what we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days, or about that many.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the sick person's hand should be suspended from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be level, and be guarded by his skill from violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And have him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All that is according to the dispositions of complexions and the dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Concerning the restoration of fractures of the Hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fracture of the hand's pectines and the joints of the fingers rarely occurs.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not occur to them unless by very frequent friction.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, when a fracture or friction of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the infirm person sit in a square position, and in front of him be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let the attendant extend the broken bones, and let the physician adjust them until they are joined with a good juncture.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he place a plaster and linen, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a bandage over it according to the size of the place, and you have already wrapped it in linen.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If, however, the fracture is near the lower part of the sole of the foot, then make a sphere out of cloth: and order the sick person to compress it with his broken foot: then tie it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the bandage be of leather, in which there is gentleness, so that the leather is applied to the foot's body: and bind it, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If, however, the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary that you place a bandage over it and another bandage from below on the sole: and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a bandage, as the hand is turned; and stretch it between the fingers with a bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a fracture occurs in any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be set according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it should be bound with the sole; and if you wish, put a small, straight bandage on it, so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If, however, the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, index, ring, or little finger, then it should be set and bound to the healthy finger following it; or all should be bound according to their continuation; and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small bandage on it, as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the resolution of the hot abscess: and apply with it what is necessary, when anything happens from it, according to the repeated narration of it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is frequently fractured, and is revealed to the senses; because it is turned towards the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done so that the ligament above the fracture is tightened, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient lies on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then the attendant should extend each ligament on its own side equally; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	However, if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then one ligament should be on the side of the crest, so that the extension falls upwards; and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let the ligament be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician should align the bone with both his hands, until he restores it to the likeness of its natural shape; and the bone is joined with a good junction.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you apply a plaster and a bandage, if an abscess does not occur on the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for a few days, until the hot abscess subsides, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	However, its bandage should be like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap a hard bandage over the fracture, that is, a bind; and double it twice, or three times; and let there be excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the leg and thigh what is left over from the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the thigh, in the place of the fracture itself, splints, and place one splint on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the tightness is equalized.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle over the place of the fracture, with three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the further you extend the bandage from the fracture site, the smaller and softer and gentler your bandage should be.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then pull at the two ends of the thread, which you inserted between the thigh and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore tie together with both of them the three splints which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then proceed with the two ends of the thread to the lower part, until you reach the ankle of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both of them also tighten the ends of the splints on the other side, so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then loosen the bandage over it, while it remains, so that no corruption, abscess, or swelling, and similar things, occur to the limb.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything of that sort happens.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, hasten with its removal, and rectify whatever has happened from it completely, according to what we have often said.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If, however, there is a piece of bone in the bone that pierces: then it is necessary, that you should smooth it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, split over it, and remove it, and treat it with what was previously mentioned, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is bound, in addition to which splints are added to it, just as we said in the discussion of the arm and shoulder.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in its restoration, thus fractured, lameness does not befall the sick person.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, in addition to which the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that the one to whom it belongs should always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound in fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is diminished: all of that is according to the diversity of complexions and the other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fractured kneecap rarely occurs, but it often experiences attrition.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If, however, a fracture does occur, then it is only either a fissure or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is both with a wound and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands over all of it with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that the parts that have been disrupted are brought into alignment with the fingers, until they are joined together as much as possible through alignment and ease and workmanship.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a poultice of sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white; and place a round pad on top of it, if you need one; and bind a suitable bandage over it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the treatments we have described in other fractures, such as a hot abscess and similar conditions, in order to apply the appropriate remedy for each complication until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick and is called the Cruris, and the other thin, and is called the Focile.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And fractures occur in both of these bones in the same ways as fractures of the two arm bones; and therefore its restoration is performed similarly to the restoration of the arm, and the procedure is the same.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If the two bones are fractured simultaneously, the leg is twisted in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is twisted towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone is fractured, you find it lower; and it is among those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and alignment, and the ligation of splints according to that standard.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having much blood: let the extension be less, and your relief gentler.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg indeed there is something more of the operation than in the arm: and it is, that when you align the splints and complete all your operation, then take two strips of pinewood, which are used in making roofing that is placed under the boards; and they are made from the blades of palm trees; and choose those which have a small thickness, and let them not be thin; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap each one in a cloth with two wraps along its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two strips in three places, from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when the constriction is forbidden, the leg deviates to the right and left, and stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed, let a cradle of wood be administered along the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it may preserve it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed it is most necessary to do this in a fracture when there is a wound with it properly.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and strive with utmost care against any abscess, or swelling, or any other ailments.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore any of those things occur, then oppose it with whatever is appropriate, until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, a fracture of the heel bone does not occur completely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, fractures of the bones of the foot sometimes occur, and fractures of the toes also occur rarely; and they do not occur except in most cases from abrasion.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs, and you see those bones rising up against each other, then the sick person should place their foot on prepared ground, just as when walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then you stand and place your foot upon that which is raised from those bones; afterwards, press or step on it, and straighten it until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a plaster, and linen above it; and put a small board beneath the sole of the foot, with two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths, and whatever else it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones straightened, whether they were broken or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Therefore, the operation is on them, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If, however, any fingers are broken, then restore them and straighten them according to what I have told you in the restoration of hand fingers.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a splint along the length of the finger, and let it be a little wider than it; then place under the foot this board that I have told you of, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If, however, what is broken of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place a splint of its size over each finger, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board at the bottom of the foot; and let it stand on one end of the board outside the sole of the foot, so that it holds firmly.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it befits you, lest you forget, to consider all that I have said to you concerning the remaining fractures from accidents that we have discussed, and to apply every accident with what is appropriate.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Of the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the breastbone, and a man's penis.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her slightly towards her back, and let her be held back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her vulva with wool, until she fills it; and let it become like a sphere in the vulva.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman should be shaken, and her back raised gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that wool will come out, until it becomes like a sphere before the gate of the vulva, and the fractured opening returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a cushion on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	Therefore, when she wants to urinate, remove the wool with ease, then let her urinate; and return it according to the manner in which you first introduced it; then let her return to her original cushion.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the opening itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a reed cannula over its opening, and introduce the whole bladder into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the cannula with force, until the bladder within the vulva is inflated, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with wool, and let it remain for several days, according to what we have narrated, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the pubis of a man, or woman, is fractured, then administer in its restoration, and its equalization, that which we have narrated concerning the bone of the hip.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not concealed in these near fractures, which rarely occur, especially in those who have some skill or practice.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for the fracture itself indicates to you, in many situations, the right way to restore it and to constrict it: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But in the penis of a man, when it is broken, take the throat of a goose, and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place upon it a wrapping of cloth, and let it be wrapped, and let it be left for three days, or thereabouts, and it will be healed, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured bone, when it is with a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for him who has suffered a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or the thigh bone, or similar to it, that you hurry, and immediately bleed him: if the conditions for bleeding are apparent to you, as we have previously stated.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound flows blood, then it is necessary that you hurry to cauterize it, so that you powder the crushed zegi upon it: if you do not have another present.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not postpone it, if there is no abscess.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	However, if a hot abscess occurs, then postpone its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause him to suffer bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If, however, the fractured bone is prominent above the skin, then it is necessary that you try to reduce it, and to align it with your hands with ease and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, its extension and alignment with your hands is not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for that, it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four, according to the quantity he needs for that treatment in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round, and let it have a small thickness, so that it does not double under compression upon it at the time of the operation; and let it have sharp edges on its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its top be of a thickness from its middle to its lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that its sharp curved end be placed upon the prominent end of the bone; and drive it with it in one turn until when the bone returns and is made equal by a certain equalization.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, try to make the fractured ends equal to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its fractured ends are thin, and the instrument does not receive it in a good manner, then it is necessary that you cut the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If however you cannot reduce them with what we have narrated at all, then cut it with what suits it from the incisions that we have described; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape that which remains on the bone from roughness and small splinters.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced, and the infirm person finds after its reduction a severe, hurting pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Therefore, do that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great aid on the infirm person, when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse a cloth in astringent, black wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place a poultice over the wound, nor anything in which there is oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer splints at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound uncovered, so that you make an incision with scissors in the dressings according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with all caution, lest you bind the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times foolish physicians have done this: and they have caused upon their sick either death, or decay, or a discharge of pus, that is, of matter.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your constriction be soft, gentle, different from the constriction of the other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have mentioned concerning it, and find pain suspended in the place, then you should not place splints over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them wrappings from hard cloths in the place of splints, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When, however, a day or two has passed, and you see the wound already beginning to generate pus, then remove from over it the cloth which you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer bandages and ointments with which it is customary for us to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus runs from it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass over a wound, and it does not consolidate, nor is pus separated from it, then know that there are small bone splinters there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore, it is necessary that you probe the wound with probes.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	And if any of those splinters are separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those of them that are not separated, and pierce the limb, and cause pain to occur, try to cut them out, and remove them by any method possible to you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If the wound suffers from any sort of ulcer, or festering, or other form of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary to apply to each of them the appropriate treatment from the preceding discussion in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And concerning that in which my words should stand, and to which you should give your immediate attention when a bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as the hip bone, and the kneecap, and similar large bones, it is not to presume to draw it back, for often death occurs from this; rather, let it be, until it becomes rotten.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For perhaps it will fall away by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then, if it seems to you, treat the wound; and if not, leave it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Concerning the treatment of swelling at the site of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This swelling often happens at the site of healing from a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially those near the joints; and the shape of the limb is disfigured by it.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, if the swelling is recent, administer to it medicines that have a styptic effect, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar to them.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you may take some, or all of them, and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and place them upon the swelling on linen, and bind them firmly over it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the bandage, and do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another, until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over it a lead sheet properly.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	However, if the swelling has already hardened into a stone, and it is tight, and necessity quickly compels its removal: then split it from above, and cut away the projecting excess; or scrape it with certain scrapers, until it is removed; and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Concerning the treatment when it is restored, and the limb remains afterward delicate, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fractured bone is restored, and the limb remains afterward delicate, weak: then that happens not only for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Among which one is the multitude of loosening of the ligament and its ligation not according to what is proper; or because of an excess of constriction of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prohibited from running to the limb; or because of a multitude of unnecessary embrocation at an improper time; or because of a scarcity of blood in the body of the weak person, and his weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment of that is to nourish the weak person, and to make his body tender, until the blood is multiplied in him.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And apply diligently embrocation with warm water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When, after the limb's healing, a crookedness, and protrusion of the fractured bone, or a knot, occurs in a limb already restored, and its natural form is disfigured, yet the limb is not hindered from its natural function, then it is not necessary to heed the opinion of one who believes that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have already been many foolish physicians and restorers who have done that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed highly reprehensible, leading to death, or great fear, so that it may be deadly.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knotting are recent, then it is necessary that it be soaked in warm water, in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as mallow leaves, and its root, and melilot, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made with a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let the mucilage of the mallow root be taken, and be beaten with hen's fat, or sesame oil: and let it be plastered with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let fat figs be taken, and ground with pigeon dung, and similar things to them which are called from medicines lessening consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knotting is loosened with assiduous, long, and gentle rubbing, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let movement of the limb be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if twisting has already preceded, and become strong, and has been turned into stone, and necessity has been provoked to cure it with iron: then it is necessary that it be cut above it, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and that which is superfluous from the knotting or bone be cut with very fine incisions: and let ease be administered to it with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Of speaking in Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of any joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prohibited from its movement, and the figure of the limb is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes great pain and severe injuries to the afflicted.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore, when dislocation occurs to someone, then it is necessary to hasten its restoration; nor should one delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes suppurated, and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation along with it.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it is not appropriate to move or extend it during the time of its suppuration.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it often causes spasm and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that occurs, then it is necessary to hasten to phlebotomy of the infirm.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be left until the abscess subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every limb should be treated with that whose memory comes into its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocations, even as preceded in fractures, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two lower jaws are rarely dislocated except rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For they are either removed from their places by a small removal, and softened for a little while.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by a complete, full dislocation, until they are softened to the chest, until the patient's saliva runs and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue becomes entangled with his speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When, however, the dislocation is small, then it returns in many ways by itself with little effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If, however, the dislocation is complete, full: then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not be delayed at all: and it is that the attendant hold the patient's head, and the physician insert the thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw between his teeth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or let him insert two thumbs of his simultaneously, if the dislocation is on two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the other fingers of his hands be outside, with which he balances.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the patient to cleanse his jaws and free them to chew on every side.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician shall align the jaw, and press the jaw, until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are locked together, then administer vaporization with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy: nor delay the reduction of both at all, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and does not soften, then place cushions of cloth upon them, with cerate made from wax and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it shall be bound with ease with soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient sleep on their back, and let their head be supported between two pillows, so that they do not move it to the right and left, nor attempt or be forced to chew anything: rather, let their food be administered by gentle sipping, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is bound, then let them eat what they wish, and let it be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let them not exert themselves with the operation of their mouth with eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is bound and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at any hour, and do not return to their places, then often fevers and persistent sweating occur, and perhaps the patient's bowels are loosened, and perhaps they vomit pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore, when you see this, then know that it is a disaster, and often the one who experiences this dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the shoulder extremity.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The collarbone indeed does not dislocate from the inner side, because of its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it sometimes dislocates outward, and that is evident to the senses.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the sick person lies on their back, and extends their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then compress the place with the force of your palm, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a plaster and bandages over it, and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	However, its extremities that follow the elbow, and are continuous with it, are not dislocated, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If, however, it is dislocated on any day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and straightened according to what we have said, and as is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a plaster and bandages over it, and bind it tightly.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And advise the sick person to adhere to rest and quiet until healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the humerus extremity is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Concerning the reduction of the humerus dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus is not dislocated except according to three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is that it is dislocated to the side of the armpit downwards.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it is dislocated to the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the humerus: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated to the rear, because of the shoulder blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated to the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And very often it is dislocated and exits downwards towards the armpit, especially in those whose flesh is scant.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it exits quickly in them, and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	However, in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, namely because it exits with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps in some men, through a blow or fall, the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is thought because of this, that it is already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that you test it until you stand upon its certainty, and then proceed in its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And dislocation is recognized when it is turned towards the armpit: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find a clear difference among them, and you find a concavity in the head of the humerus, and under the armpit, upon touching, the head of the humerus seems like an egg itself; and the sick person cannot bring the hand to their ear, nor move it through all motions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, then you find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed, a simple reduction of this dislocation is possible when it is recent or the patient is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is for the attendant to raise the hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under their armpit, and raise the joint with strength upwards to its place; and the attendant raise the hand, and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him place it below, for it will return quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	However, if it does not return by what we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation be administered which softens and soothes, such as if roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient should be laid on their back; and a sphere and wool, which is equal between softness and tightness, should be placed under their armpit.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should place his heel on the sphere, and raise the head of the humerus with strength, and pull the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another attendant should hold the patient's head, so that it does not move downwards; for it will return immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is so that you should have a man present who is taller than the patient, and stand on the side, and insert his arm under the patient's armpit, and raise the armpit upwards, until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another attendant should pull the patient's hand downwards towards their abdomen.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If however the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that a long piece of wood should be fixed in the ground, whose head is round in shape, like a mortar's sleeve; which should not be thick, nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then, after soft cloths are placed over the head of the wood, the patient is placed beneath it, standing along the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand should be extended downwards on one side, and his body extended on the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is that you should take wood whose length is the amount of two arms, and its width the amount of four fingers, and its thickness the amount of two fingers; to which there should be a round head, so that its entrance into the depth of the socket is eased, according to this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are bound over the round head, so that the wood does not injure the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then, place it under the patient's socket, so that the hand or arm is extended downwards along the wood; and the wood is bound to the support, arm, and hand's extremity.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm on a step of a ladder, widthwise, and extend the hand downwards, and let the rest of the body hang suspended on the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The joint immediately enters.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore its entry is completed in whatever manner possible, then it is necessary to place a sphere of equal size made of wool beneath the socket.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared plaster, made from mill dust with frankincense and egg white, over the entire shoulder, as it revolves from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind a suitable bandage beneath the socket, and rotate the bandage over the plaster from above; and bind his hand to his neck, and let it hang, and do not move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that little food be given to the weak one, until the limb is strengthened; because this is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then, after seven or five days, a larger one is placed, and it is exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it is strengthened and does not soften, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If, however, the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture that occurs in it, or because of some other cause: then it is necessary that a cautery with three openings be applied to it, according to what has been said in the chapter on cauteries.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and constriction are applied to it repeatedly, and it is not strengthened, and it falls, and it cannot raise itself upwards: then know that the nerves belonging to the head of the humerus are now cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	However, the reduction of a dislocation towards the chest and nipple, or to the back, is done with pushing and pulling with the hands, until it returns, and further constriction and care are applied to it until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If, after healing, heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then let the patient use a bath frequently until that heaviness is lessened, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty.  Indeed, it dislocates in all directions, and especially forward or backward.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you, since it is apparent to the sight and touch, regardless of the manner in which it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, that is made manifest to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is hollowed out, and the arm cannot double itself, nor touch its shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess occurs to it, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it will not be completely healed, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all types of dislocations, and causes them more intense pain; and often death descends with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration, when it is of those that can be reduced, is that his hand be extended with two hands; and his arm be spread out, and the physician's hands be above the elbow and below it, and he impel the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or truly the dislocation is towards the front; then it returns thus, that he double his hand with his hand, until he strike with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a very forceful, strong extension; and it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants also hold it, so that it is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is to be revolved in every direction after a long doubled cloth, or a wide bandage, is wrapped around his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil, so that it may be of those things which aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should drive the joint with a forceful impulse, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be placed upon it, in which there is astringency and desiccation with egg white; and it should be bound with a suitable bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the patient's neck, and leave it for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be released.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint is strengthened in its place, then release the bandage from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not being properly bound, then reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it for several days until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however, after the reduction of the joint, heaviness occurs to it, and its disposition is in motion: then administer moistening in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is calmed, or place over the joint the fat of a ram's rump.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it should be bandaged, and leave it over it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and immerse it in a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat over it in the manner of the poultice, once, and twice, and thrice, with each bath entry, until it is soothed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place upon it cow dung, moist, heated with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For thus it is soothed, and returns to its proper state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The joint between the arm and hand, the Mahassem, is frequently dislocated.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, speed is required in reducing its dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place becomes suppurated; or a hot abscess occurs there.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation is to place the weak hand's Mahassem on a board, and the attendant extend his hand; and the physician place his palm on the prominence of the joint, and push it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already receded to the back of the hand; then the infirm place the back of his hand on the board for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding toward the back of the hand, then place his hand's inside upon the board, that is, the inner part of his hand be placed on the board, so that the physician's hand falls upon the very prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster for the abscess: and leave it, and do not repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you effect its reduction after days have passed, but the joint remains according to its twisting; and it causes no harm to the infirm person, except that the hand is softened, and cannot grasp anything; then know that the nerves are severed, or bruised.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore, there is no remedy for it, except to cauterize it near the place of its injury.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps that will not help anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Almahassem does not return, then place upon it the plaster, which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then let it be bound, and let it be left for five days; afterwards let it be loosened and let it be left, and let the hand be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however its movement is deprived, and something serious happens to it: then gently warm it with heated water, and rub it several times, until it is soothed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the Fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated to any side, or a finger is dislocated to the back of the palm, or its front: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is straightened in its own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore it is night, bind it according to the narration itself: and do not cease to loosen it in the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for a few days, until it is strong.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly do with it, if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand: and bind it to the part itself, and perform your first operation on it, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly do with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the spine of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the spine of the back, or the neck, is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are removed from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death hastens for the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of that is that the excretion of the sick person comes out without his will, nor can he hold it: and many times certain members of him are softened from it, or his two legs, or his two arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it is removed, for often their removal happens in four directions.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed to the back is called a hump.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	However, the treatment of it is, that you should consider then, if a hump occurs from childhood: then there is no treatment for it, nor is there any cure from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	However, in that which occurs from a fall, or a blow, or similar things to those, the ancients have already described methods of treatment in lengthy language.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which most often there is no benefit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I, however, have now abbreviated it, from that, of which little excuses itself from much of its proximity to my intention: and by my exposition, which I have set forth, and have fashioned its instrument in a different manner from that in which they showed it, and exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that in a hump which occurs on the front part, there is no remedy, nor cure from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which occurs on both sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, unless that which occurs on the back properly, with that which I relate: and it is, that the sick person be stretched out upon their face upon an equal platform near a wall: and damp straw be spread beneath it, so that their chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a straight piece of wood be fixed in a hole in the ground, at the end of the platform, approximately at its head; and another piece of wood approximately at its feet at the other end of the platform; and let an attendant hold the wood, and it not be firmly fixed in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another attendant hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap around the head of the sick person, and under their armpits a soft, firm bandage: and extend the end of the bandage to the wood that is at their head: and tie it to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then bind another bandage above their elbows, and above their knees, and at their ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages together, and tie them to the other piece of wood that is at their feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let each attendant stretch the bandage towards the piece of wood, and do not remove the two pieces of wood from the places where they are fixed: but let them not be firmly held, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And let the physician place his palms upon the vertebra with strength, until it returns to place; or let him place a board upon it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he binds his feet to the board, until it returns to place.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is approximately three arms' lengths.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And hollow out a space in the wall, of which we said that it is near the sick person, for the end of the board to enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the vertebra.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tie it tightly until the vertebra is compressed, and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, work with a turning tool that is grasped by your hand: and it is so that you fix two pieces of wood, each of the length of one arm, in the earth at the head of the sick person on the furthest part of the footstool, and two pieces of wood at his head on the furthest part of the footstool.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the distance between each piece of wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in every place through which the turning tool passes; and let every piece of wood be firmly fixed in the earth so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let a round piece of wood be inserted; and the turning tool is in it, around which the bandage revolves in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its extremity is a hole in which a piece of wood is fixed, whose length is the same as that which revolves; and in the other two pieces of wood is similarly one of the same.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the bandages that you have applied to the chest of the sick person with the turning tool which is at his head; and the bandages that you have applied to his legs with the turning tool which is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let a servant stand by each turning tool, who shall turn his hand with the cord, with which the turning tool revolves; and the physician shall adjust the Spine, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turning tool, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, after the Spine is restored and the place is levelled, then it is necessary that you place a drying plaster made from egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then, a bandage.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place on top of the plaster a small board, whose width is three fingers, or approximately that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the amount that covers the place of the Hump, and over the healthy part of the Spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bound with the bandage we spoke of.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the sick person use fine nourishment until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If something of prominence remains in the place at the end of the healing: then it is necessary that medicines that soften and soothe be administered, with the administration of the board we have described, for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a lead plate is administered to it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes a prominence occurs in the last vertebra of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that is the bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not appropriate to presume to treat it with this medicine, for it might perhaps cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocated Ancha.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that the joint of the Ancha, and the joint of the humerus, do not suffer anything but dislocation alone; nor do they suffer what happens to other joints from a slight separation and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the joint of the Ancha is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And it is most often dislocated inwards; and it is slightly dislocated forward and backward.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation inwards is: because when you join the weak leg to the healthy one, it is longer; and its knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the weak one cannot bend its foot at the groin; and there is a location that follows the groin, ulcerated with a hot ulcer, because the head of the thigh has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him who suffers dislocation outwards is that its accidents are contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him who suffers dislocation forward is that he stretches the healthy leg to its full extent; however, he does not bend it without pain which is in the knee; and if he attempts to walk, he cannot step forward; and his urine is retained, and his groin is ulcerated, and in walking his heel is on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him who suffers dislocation backward is that he does not extend his knee, nor can he bend it before bending his groin; and his leg is also shorter than the other; and his groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is at the location of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation, however, is such that you must then consider, if the dislocation is old, which has already grown old with the person who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains in its condition: then there is no cure in it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it is not necessary for a complete presumption to be made on him.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	However, in the one whose dislocation is recent, and is from one of the four types of dislocation, then hasten to this, so that you wish to join the joint and extend it inwardly and outwardly, and move it right and left; for perhaps it returns, and does not require further treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If, however, it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and he extend his leg from the lower part; either with his hands, or with a bandage, which is tied above his leg above the knee; and another assistant extend his hand from above, so that he inserts his hands under his kneecaps.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he shall tighten with a gentle bandage above the root of the thigh, and hold the end of the other bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let his extension be either from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the crotch, or from the posterior to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of all of them be at the same time, until the sick person is lifted with his body from the earth, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this species of extension is a common species of the four species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every species that I shall say about its own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of it indeed, when the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that the sick person be laid on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should place a bandage on the root of the thigh, in that which is between the head of the thigh and the place that is beneath the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upward from the groin region to the higher part of the body, to the area of the crotch.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong attendant take his arms, and reduce the large part of the sick person's thigh, and extend it outward with forceful traction.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For now it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the other types of treatment, by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	However, if it is resisted by you, and does not obey you for entry with this type of treatment at all: then it is necessary that the two feet of the sick person be tied together with a strong, gentle bandage over the two heels, and over the two knees: and the length of each one from its counterpart shall be the quantity of four fingers: and let the sick leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the sick person be suspended above a wooden beam, which is in the house: and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong young man to secure the head of the thigh: and let him be suspended with the sick person by another young man: and let another young man, securing the thigh with strength, propel it, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In its own return, however, when the dislocation is outward, it is necessary that the sick person lie on a platform, according to what we have described in the case of a hunchback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And a bandage is to be tied over his sick leg, properly, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let a piece of wood be placed in the middle of the platform, securely fastened; upon which let moist cloths be wrapped, so that it does not harm the sick person; and let the wood be between his thighs, so that it is not drawn downwards during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let every attendant pull to his side, and let the physician equalize the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it obeys the return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place it upon the board itself, and press it, just as we said in the case of a hump, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick person lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary that the sick person's leg be pulled quickly; and it is according to this same account on a platform; and let the physician place the palm of his right hand on the sick person's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he tightens it with the other hand, and with that tightening, places it extended downwards to the part of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is towards the back, then it is not necessary that the sick person be stretched downwards and raised above the ground; rather, it is necessary that he be placed on a hard object, as is also necessary if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we said about his lying on two hips; and it is on his face, and the ligaments extended, according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also over the place to which the joint emerges, when the reduction is completed as is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend the two legs of the sick person; and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his leg, and expands it without excuse, then know that the limb has now returned as is necessary; then join the two hips, and apply a plaster, and bind it with a bandage, that is, a roller: so that the hip is not moved to any part; and let the sick person adhere to rest for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then untie the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in status, then know that the dislocation is now firm; therefore dismiss the sick person to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening, then return, and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding; and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then untie it and make him/her slow in walking on both sides for some days, until it is strengthened well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Concerning the dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, that is, backwards.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And a sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the sick person to apply their leg to their hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If however it does not adhere with the hip, then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all the ways of its dislocation is that you make the sick person sit upright, so that if possible he extends his leg over it, and adheres your back to his face, and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make his knee adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another attendant should extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh with ease, not with effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then bandage it, and make the leg adhere to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the sick person not use walking for some days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If its reduction is refused, then administer a strong extension with bandages, whose description preceded in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the Calcaneus.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-four.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus is sometimes removed with a small displacement, and sometimes dislocated completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either inwards or outwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the Calcaneus swollen, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its removal is easy by returning it: and it is that it be extended easily with the hands, and straightened, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment however, when it is dislocated completely, it is necessary that you have the sick person sit upright; and let a very strong assistant hold him from the back of his back, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you hold his foot with your right hand from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the ankle joint.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left hand twice.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left, and drive the foot's front with the right towards the leg without exertion.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have narrated.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the foot's front to the leg for the third time, and you pull the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns in one time, or in two according to this method, and you see the foot levelled, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, because it returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however its reduction is prohibited to you with what we have narrated, then make the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a firmly planted stake in the ground, so that it falls between his thighs; and you have already wrapped a cloth around it, so that it does not harm the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the attendant take his thigh; afterwards, let another attendant stretch the foot, either with their hands or with a bandage that ties to the foot's ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let every attendant extend against the extension of their counterpart; and let the stake stand between the sick person's two thighs, holding him, so that his body is not pulled downwards during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician should adjust the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant should hold the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	Therefore, when the dislocation returns, and its return's health is evident to you, then apply a plaster and lint, and tightly bind it with bandages, and tie the foot to the leg with a bandage.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary to be cautious or fearful of the nerves located above the posterior heel, so that the bandage is not too tight on them and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the bandage softens, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and prohibit the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If, however, he attempts to walk before that period, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be dislodged, and be corrupted, and not receive subsequent healing.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to apply to it the treatment described in another place in our previous discussion, and a poultice, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary to align what is dislocated from them with a slight extension, without effort; and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If, however, the dislocation is in some nodes of the foot's back, then it is necessary that the patient sit his foot upon a level place, or upon a board; and that he stand as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you shall stand and place your foot upon that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with force, until it returns, and you see it now aligned, and no projection appears in the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under the sole of his foot a board that encompasses the entire foot, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and keep him from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and secured from reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the types of dislocation with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of this sort occurs, and you attempt its cure and restoration, often death results; and on account of this, it is not fitting that anyone should presume to treat such a case unless he is skilled in the art through long experience, compassionate, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous; and that he should use in the beginning medicaments which soothe only hot abscesses; and he should leave the sick person to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see, or hope for, salvation from perdition with the alleviation of the illness, and in which something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If, therefore, the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that will soothe the abscess, and treat the wound with whatever appropriate desiccant ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with a fracture, and separate bone fragments occur, then attempt the removal of them, and do in that what we have said in simple illnesses from what preceded in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, according to what my teaching has preceded for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more beneficial to your body among those in your time.
