Of fleshy hernia  
In this condition, I have never seen anyone who dared to treat it with a knife.
And the ancients said that it is done like the condition that is with infection, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after the cut on the testicles lightly below;
Then cut in the middle, and treat the abscess as it appears, until the vessels fall; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
