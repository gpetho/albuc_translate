Chapter fifty-six on the rash that appears on the foreskin, glans, blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the glans.	CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX. On pustules occurring on the prepuce and on the glans; and blackness and necrosis and adhesions between glans and prepuce.	0.7379929
This ulcer often appears in the urethra, and it is a fleshy, foul growth, and it can be malignant or benign.	These pustules very frequently occur in the urinary meatus and are excrescences of foul tissue. Some are malignant and some are not.	0.6535185
The benign one should be grasped with a delicate hook and cut until it is completely cleaned, then apply to it cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterwards with palm ointment until it heals.	The nonmalignant you should seize with a fine hook and pare away until they are altogether gone; then apply to the place cotton wool soaked in Egyptian ointment; then afterwards dress with Palm ointment until healed.	0.84378034
But if the ulcer is malignant and foul-colored, then cauterization should be used after cutting and scraping it.	But when the pustules are malignant, of a dirty colour, for these you should employ the cautery after cutting and scraping them.	0.8339171
If the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and some of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and some of it is outside, then the ulcer that is inside should be extracted first until it heals, and then treat it from the outside because if you treat them both together, you cannot be sure that the foreskin will not be perforated.	If the pustules be on the prepuce of an uncircumcized unbeliever and there are some inside the prepuce and some outside, those that are inside should be removed first; and when they are healed over, then treat those outside. For if you deal with both at the same time you are in danger of going through the prepuce.	0.8452438
Blackness and decay may also occur in the labia and in the foreskin, so it is necessary to scrape all that has blackened and is about to decay or has decayed, then smear on it honey with ground, sifted pomegranate peels and kirsana, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.	Sometimes there occurs a blackness and necrosis in the testicles and prepuce; then you should scrape away all the black part which looks ready to go necrotic or has already necrosed. Then afterwards smear on the place honey with pounded and sifted pomegranate peel and bitter vetch. Then carry on with the usual treatment until healed.	0.7138624
If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped iron in this way:	If haemorrhage set in, cauterize with a lunate cautery figured thus.	0.6331455
Cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and a wound if it becomes infected.	For the cautery serves a twofold purpose, namely against haemorrhage and for a putrefying wound.	0.618785
If the glans penis is eroded and completely gone at some point, then a lead tube should be inserted into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it.	If at any time the penis mortifies and goes entirely, you should pass into the urethra a leaden cannula so that the patient can make water.	0.8494152
As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans penis, and this adhesion only occurs in someone whose foreskin is intact and who is not obligated to be circumcised, and its adhesion may occur due to a wound or swelling, it should be peeled off with a blunt scalpel until the bond dissolves and the glans penis is freed from every side.	As to the adhesion of the glans to the prepuce (which occurs in him who has his prepuce intact, being under no obligation to be circumcized; sometimes too adhesion may occur by reason of a wound or an abscess) you should scrape it with a flat-nosed scalpel until the adhesion is divided and the glans penis is freed all round from the prepuce.	0.8525089
If it is difficult to distinguish them upon investigation, then something from the glans penis and the foreskin should be peeled off, because the foreskin is thin, so it may be perforated quickly due to its thinness.	But if the complete separation of the two be difficult then you should dissect away a little of the glans and of the prepuce; for the prepuce is thin, and consequently it is often pierced quickly.	0.72365326
Then separate the foreskin and the glans penis with a thin linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water so that they do not stick together again, then treat it with an astringent drink until it heals.	Separate then between the glans and the prepuce with a piece of fine linen dipped in cold water to prevent further adhesions. Then let it be dressed with some styptic wine till it heals over.	0.7652956
