of wounds/about wounds	On the cure of wounds.	0.4729324
We have already spoken in the division about the treatment of wounds; now we will tell you the treatments of hands and of medicine, according to completion.	I have already mentioned in the appropriate section the treatment of such wounds as are suitable for cauterization. Here I shall describe the operative and medical treatment in full.	0.6821251
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and from what they are made.	So I begin by saying that wounds differ according to that which causes them and according to the site.	0.73517865
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of a stone, and the cut of a sword and knife, or of a spear or wood or arrow, or similar things; or that are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the foot, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members; and I will tell you the treatment of each wound, and will begin with simple head wounds, for the remaining will come in its chapter.	Those things that cause wounds are many: a knock from a stone, a cut from a sword or a knife, a blow by a spear, stick, or arrow; and many such things. To consider wounds according to their site on the body, they are such as a wound occurring in the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver, and so on. Now I am going to describe the treatment of certain wounds, so that you may take them as a standard and a guide for other wounds. I shall begin particularly with the simple wounds of the head; for mention of the compound wounds will be made at the beginning of the third book.	0.8836877
I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head, and the bone is not broken, take note if it is from the throwing of a stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear the development of a hot abscess: then immediately have him bleed from the cephalic vein, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side from the injured part; and the patient should avoid repletion from wine and rich foods.	I say then, that when there occurs a simple wound of the head, with no accompanying bone-fracture, you should look; and if it be caused by a knock from a stone or the like, and has only broken the skin, but it is a big wound and you fear lest there occur an abscess, then bleed the cephalic vein at once without delay; draw off from him blood in proportion to his vigour if there is no contra-indication to venesection; and particularly if the haemorrhage from the wound be slight. The venesection should be on the opposite side to the wound; and caution the patient against gluttony and wine and rich food.	0.9063232
And if he does not want to bleed, then let his food be light, and he should not drink wine, nor eat meat; and put on the wound, if a hot abscess develops there, cotton moistened only in rose oil, or in astringent wine; and if there is no hot abscess, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not altered by the air, a powder, which I will describe a little later; and if the air has altered it, then put on some ointments, until it is healed.	But if from any cause venesection is prevented, he should be on a light diet and avoid meat and wines. And apply to the wound, if there be any inflammation, cotton wool soaked in oil of roses, either alone or with a somewhat astringent wine. And if you are sure there is no inflammatory swelling, then apply directly to the wound, if its blood is fresh and it is unaltered by the air, the powder that I shall describe to you a little later. But if the air has already changed the wound, apply to it one of the ointments to cause it to discharge the pus; then dress until healed.	0.8598927
And if the wound is large, such as from a cut of a sword or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together by tents, then bring them together by stitching, as I will describe for wounds of the belly, concerning stitching.	Now if it be a great wound, being caused by a sword-cut or the like, and dressings will not bring the edges of the wound together, you should suture them together in the manner I shall describe in dealing with the suture of abdominal wounds.	0.8596155
If the wound is uncovered to the bone, and hangs, and only holds on by a little, then cut it off; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat rich foods, such as heads and cooked wheat, also like chicken, and similar things.	But if the skin has actually disclosed the bone, and is attached by a small strip only, then cut it away and dress the wound with medicaments that will produce firm flesh to replace the skin, and bid the patient go on a diet of solid food such as brawn and gruels and the like.	0.80247986
And if you find rot in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, then cut away all the rot, and throw it away, then treat it; and if there is an artery in the wound or a vein, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, then search for the artery, and if you find it displaced, then tie it with a thread; and if that is not helpful, then cauterize it.	And if decomposition arise in the skin and it will not adhere to the bone, then excise all the diseased part and discard it and then dress. If in these wounds there be an artery or vein shedding blood, and medicinal applications do not stanch it, then examine the artery, and if you find it not quite severed then cut it through with a scalpel and ligature it; and if you are compelled, our directions being unavailing, then cauterize until the haemorrhage stops.	0.8994751
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and that is that you put in this powder which heals before the air alters it.	If these be small and simple wounds their treatment will be a light and easy matter; it is sufficient to sprinkle some of this powder on while they are still bleeding, before the atmosphere causes a change.	0.79071367
And the method for the powder is this: take one part incense; two parts dragon's blood; three parts quicklime, and powder it finely, and fill the wound, and bind it tightly, so that it dries well and joins with all its blood; and then tie it well, and leave it without untying, unless it swells; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.	Description of the powder: let one part of olibanum and two parts of dragon's blood be taken, and three parts of quick or slaked lime, all beaten up together and passed through the sieve; and let the wound be packed with this and bound up tightly so that the powder sticks in position and coagulates with the blood. Then bind pads above and let it be, not undoing it so long as it remains without swelling; for the dressing will not come away of itself until it is healed.	0.8516365
And sometimes this is done with lime alone, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but only if the air has not altered the wound.	Lime alone can do this if you have no olibanum and dragon's blood at hand. It has exactly the same effect too on most large wounds, when the application and bandaging are properly done, and when the haemorrhage is recent, so long as the air has not changed them.	0.6680925
And if the air has altered the wound, especially in summer, then one does not put this powder on it; but applies some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it discharges pus; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.	If, however, the air has brought about some change, especially if it be in the summer season, then there is no point in the application of this powder. Treat it then as we have said, by applying one or other of the suppurative ointments; or by applying a gruel of barleymeal with water and honey, so that the pus flows; then treat by all the usual methods until cured.	0.84561646
And if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine pincers; and I will tell you later about fractures of the head.	If, with the wound, there be also fracture of a bone, if it be slight, you should extract it with forceps. I mention the treatment of fractures of the head later on.	0.7968247
of the wound of the neck	On wounds in the neck:	0.6417227
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.	If a wound occur in the neck the treatment of it does not differ from that of a head wound, if it be simple.	0.7397953
If it is the nerve, there is no other solution than to leave it to heal, and not to apply anything restrictive, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their connection is with the brain, which is the highest member; but let the medicine be soft, such as warm water washes, and mixed with rose oil, and cooked leeks also washed in fresh water, and other ground-up stones in this manner, and moist ointments.	But if a nerve or artery in the neck happens to be cut: if it be a nerve, there is no device that will serve except to avoid treatment of it by strong styptic remedies such as verdigris and vitriol and the like; for these injure the nerve and cause spasm; and under no circumstance let anything cold be applied to the wound, for the substance of the nerve is cold and it is continuous with the brain, which is the most noble among the organs. But let your remedy for it be mild, such as lime slaked in sweet water many times and moistened with olive-oil or oil of roses; and with tutty, likewise washed in sweet water; and other minerals according to this prescription, and with bland ointments.	0.8511557
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.	If the wound be large, use stitches or draw the edges of the wound together with pads; then dress until cured.	0.7203131
And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, then treat it as I have said in its chapter.	If it be a fresh wound, sprinkle on the powder I have described ; and if any bone corrupt in the wound and it becomes a fistula, treat it by those means we shall mention in their place.	0.7203674
of the wound from a lance or knife If it is a blow from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, then see if wind comes out of the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal; and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put the powder in it at the first hour, and do not bind it because of the blood so that it does not remain deep inside, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but put in an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day; and if you do not have ointment, then put old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; so no spasm will come, nor bad heart tremors or shortness of breath; and when you see the good signs, then know that the wound is safe.	If it be a piercing wound by a spear or a knife, and you see that it is deep, examine if there be a passage of air out of it when the patient breathes; whence you may know that the injury is mortal. But if it is not deep and the haemorrhage is fresh, then do not straight away apply powder or bandage lest it keep the blood in the depths, so that it be returned to the heart and kill the patient; but apply to it a drawing ointment, and uncover it twice daily. If you have no ointment, apply carded cotton to the opening of the wound to soak up the humidities issuing from it. And make the patient sleep on the (side of the) wound so that what collects therein may flow out.	0.8786204
If it is a blow from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, then see if wind comes out of the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal; and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put the powder in it at the first hour, and do not bind it because of the blood so that it does not remain deep inside, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but put in an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day; and if you do not have ointment, then put old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; so no spasm will come, nor bad heart tremors or shortness of breath; and when you see the good signs, then know that the wound is safe. Then treat it with tents and other treatments, until it is healed; and if it cannot heal, and opens again, know that there is a fistula; so treat it as one should.	If you have no ointment, apply carded cotton to the opening of the wound to soak up the humidities issuing from it. And make the patient sleep on the (side of the) wound so that what collects therein may flow out. And if three or four days pass by after the wound, and the patient have no spasm or harmful palpitation of the heart nor obstruction to drawing breath, and you see that in other respects he is doing well, you may know that the wound is not dangerous; so treat it with pads and the usual dressings until it heals. But if it will not heal and it permanently discharges pus, you may know that it has become a fistula; look for the treatment of this in the proper place.	0.8657606
And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and it is simple, whether in the chest or the back, treat it as described before; if it is large, with stitching; and if it is small, with powder, and if it is pressed into the bone, and has cut pieces, then search the wound, and draw them out if they are detached; and if they are not detached, let the wound fester, then the extraction will be easier; and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.	If the wound be from a cut with a sword or knife, a straightforward surface wound in the breast or back, then treat it as described before; that is, by suture if it be a great wound or by powder if it be a small one. But if there has also been injury to the bone, cutting out fragments from it, you should explore the wound and hasten to draw out the fragments if they are detached from the bone; but if they are not detached then let be until the wound suppurates, when the removal of the fragments will be easy. Then with regard to other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, the same class of treatment should be used for them as for those already mentioned.	0.9091126
