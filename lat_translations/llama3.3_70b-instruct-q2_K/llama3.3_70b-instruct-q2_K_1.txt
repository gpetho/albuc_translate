Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I completed for you, oh sons, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its complement, and I reached the end in it, from its explanations and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the operation by hand has been neglected in our region and time, and has been completely abandoned; until perhaps its science has perished and its track has been cut off; and there have not remained of it except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered; and error and hesitation occurred to them, until its intentions were closed and its use was prolonged: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the organization of this Treatise in it, according to the method of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and that I should come with the forms of iron instruments of cauterization, and other instruments of work; with the addition of declarations, and with the preparation of what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason for which a good practitioner of it with his hand is not found in our time, is: that the art of medicine is long, and its author must exercise beforehand in the science of anatomy, which Galen described, until he knows the functions of the members, and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their outgoing, and the veins' pulses, and quietness, and the places of their exits.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of that, Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since he who is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy, will not be cautious, and will already fall into error, by which men are harmed: as I have seen many of them, who boast about this science, and speak of it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened was that I saw a physician make an incision into a scrofulous aposteme on a woman's neck and he cut some arteries in the neck, from which the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead at his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who presumed he would extract a stone from a man which had grown inside him over time, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore approached him, and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	For the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I had already been called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the weakness of the man that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke of our land because of medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him that he got a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician acted with his ignorance, and pressed the fracture above the wound with poultices, and applied a tight bandage, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he treated him according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he left him for some days and ordered him not to undo the bandage: and it stayed like that until his leg became apostematic and his foot, and it came to destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called to him: and I hastened to undo the bandage: and calmness followed, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	But indeed the corruption had already been established in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Then the corruption ceased to spread through the limb until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous aposteme, and it became an ulcer after some days, until the evil of it became great with its owner.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	What is, that when it is pure cancer from melancholic humor, then it is not suitable to be pierced with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can tolerate it, so that all of it can be cut away.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And on account of that, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, an operation to which health is associated, and an operation in which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already excited in every place of this book, in which comes the operation, in which there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	For it is necessary for you to beware of that, and dismiss it: so that the stupid ones do not find a way to speak and to disown.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Receive therefore the measure with solicitude and protection, and your infirm ones with facility and firmness, and use the better way leading by the grace of God to salvation and praiseworthy succession: and dismiss dreadful anxieties of difficult healing: and lift your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation enters into your faith and your commodity.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining to your glory, and sublime in this world, and afterwards to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in certain of his warnings.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not call the evil sickness medicine: nor name the bad physician.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	The first Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Of the cauterization with fire, and sharp medicine cauterization, chapter and ordained from head to feet, and forms of instruments, and ironments of cauterization: and all that which is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	The second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Of cutting and piercing, bloodletting and puncture, and wounds: and the removal of arrows, and similar things to that: and the entire chapter, ordered in the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	The third chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Of restoration and dislocation, and the cure of twisting, and similar things to that: a chapter, ordered from head to foot, and in the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Of cauterization and branding: and with which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before which thing it is necessary to recall the quality of its cauterizations and brandings: and in what complexions they are exhibited.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the discourse on the quality of cauterization and branding is a profound and subtle science, and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	And many wise men have spoken on it, and disagreed about it: and for myself it is enough to take a little from their discourses, fearing a prolonged discussion.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that cauterization is suitable for every complexion, which is with material and without material: excepting two complexions, which are a hot complexion without material, and a dry complexion without material.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	But in the hot and dry complexions with material they disagree.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some have said that cauterization is suitable for it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others have said the opposite, namely that cauterization is not suitable for a disease which is from heat and dryness: since the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable to cure a hot and dry disease with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he said, the one who says the opposite of that: that which is treated by cauterization becomes a remedy in every hot and dry ailment that occurs in the bodies of men: for when you compare the body of a man and its humidities to the complexion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say through his speech: that the experiment has already revealed that to me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	But it is not fitting that one should come upon that, unless he has already been proven and exercised in the chapter of Cauterization's final exercise, and knows the diversity of the complexions of men, and the disposition of ailments in themselves, and their causes, and accidents, and the space of time of them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the remaining complexions, however, there is not above the use fear: and especially in cold and humid ailments.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have already agreed upon them, and do not disagree with the remedy of Cauterization in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, my sons, that from the secret of cure by Cauterization with fire, and its goodness over Cauterization with burning medicine is: for fire is simple, whose action does not penetrate except to the member which is cauterized: and does not harm another member joined to it, except with a little injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of burning medicine penetrates to that which extends from the members: and perhaps makes occur in a member an ailment of difficult healing, and perhaps kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, on account of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now that has become known to us through experiment, on account of the length of service and study with art, and position upon the truth of things: and because of that I will excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not, I would not be allowed to reveal to you in my book a secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of expulsion, which expels diseases, demonstrated by philosophical speech, which will be keen in your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And you should know, sons, that they themselves disagree on the time in which it is suitable to apply a cauterization, and they put the best time in the spring.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that a cauterization is suitable at any time, because the harm that occurs on account of the time is outweighed by the benefit that is drawn with the cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if a cauterization is on account of pains from necessary pains, strong, urgent ones, which do not tolerate delay: because what is feared from them is that a greater evil will occur, which is worse than the small harm that occurs on account of the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let it not fall into your minds, O sons, that which they do not consider, except the common and stupid physicians, namely that the diseases which are healed by a cauterization, do not always return: and they think that this is a consequence, and the thing is not as they think: because a cauterization is not, unless in place of medicine, which alters the complexion, and evacuates the humors which are the causes, for which pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, a cauterization surpasses medicine by the swiftness of its health, and the virtue of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the disease may return at some hour of time according to the complexion of the weak person, and the location of his disease, and its virtue: and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it: and what pervades into it in acquiring them from foods, and similar things from causes, unless a disease is made, in which a cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle inflammation in a member with little superfluity of blood and humidity, such as a cauterization of the tooth, because of pain, and similar to it, is possible that the pain does not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	And I speak to the common people again, that cauterization is the last of medicine, is a straight speech: not according to what they themselves intend in it: since they believe that there is no cure which agrees with medicine, nor with another thing after the application of the cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The thing is contrary to that, and the intention, that cauterization is the last of medicine, is not, except that when we administer modes of cure in some disease, and those medicines do not agree: then we administer in the end of the thing cauterization, and it agrees: therefore it falls, that cauterization is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish medical men understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say that except because of the equality of gold, and the sublimity of its substance: and they said that it does not produce pus in the place of the cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But it is not true absolutely: since I have already proved that, and found that it does not do that in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	Truly however when you ignite the cauterization fire from gold, it is not declared to you, when it is ignited according to the quantity that you use, because of the rubedo of the gold: and when it approaches the cold, and if you add ignition on top of it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Wherefore the artisan falls from that in work: and because of that cauterization with iron is made by us more swiftly and nearer to the truth for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have already arranged this chapter on cauterization, following the chapters, and I have arranged them from head to feet, so that they provide to the inquirer what he wants from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	On the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Head II or Chapter II, Head
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization is beneficial for the domination of humidity and cold over the brain: which two are causes of heaviness, and an abundance of flux of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and an abundance of sleep, and pain in the teeth, and pain in the throat: and universally all sickness which occurs due to cold, such as palsy, and heaviness, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar to those diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is that you should precede the weak with a purging medicine to clean the head for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the weak person requires, and their age, and their habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct them to shave their head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make them sit between your hands in a square shape, so that they have already placed their hands on their chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of the palm of your hand on the root of their nose between their eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger touches, mark that place with an incision.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then prepare the olive cautery for ignition, whose shape is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the marked location with an incision, and lower it, by which your hand is contracted little by little, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly, and inspect the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that it has already drawn out from the bone a quantity of head alkali, or a quantity of zeherb, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, you will strike your hand with the iron itself or with another from it if it becomes chilled: until the bones which I mentioned to you are visible.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cotton in it, and put it on the place: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put on it a cotton soaked in butter, and leave it on the place, until the eschar is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with the ointment Tetrapharmacon, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	Now they have said, that the more a wound remains open, the more it emits pus: therefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them have said, that the skin should be cauterized to the bone: and that the cauterization should be held, until there is a thickness like that of bone.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape away what has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to perforate with a cauterization iron to the extreme, until it makes an impression on the bone for a mold, so that the bone falls, which is made like a form of a comb: or the instrument that women use to insert a letter of the alphabet: and they extract, what vapors of the head expire from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it, until it becomes consolidated.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, however, these two kinds of cauterization do not seem suitable except in certain men according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it, is better with me for the health of itself.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened from the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified in the other members: and especially when the head is weak and feeble by nature: and a certain kind of cauterization is more salvatory and better with me, and I use it: therefore operate with it for health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On the method of cauterizing the head for pain throughout the whole head.
Caput III.	Chapter Three.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When there is chronic pain throughout the whole head: and it is prolonged in the sick person, and they are treated with henna, and cohchia, and head purges, and oils, and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with a single cauterization, which we have described, and none of those things are of benefit to it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and it is not weak, and it meets with vehement cold: then cauterize with another cauterization under that a little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it on the entire horn of its head with a cauterization, so that it does not penetrate too deeply through the skin, and a quantity is discovered from the bone, which we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with a single cauterization on the back of its head, in the place which is called the "uas": and it is a place where the ventose is applied: and elevate your target in this, and you will not discover bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the sick person meets with vehement and diverse pain from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this Cauterization in its proper place: and it is necessary that there be a cauterization, with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its occiput more subtly than the cauterization with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the method of cauterizing for hemicania, both with medicated cauteries and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter Four.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When there is pain and inflammation in one part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is treated with medicines that cleanse the head, and the rest of the treatment which I mentioned in the divisions of diseases is administered, and none of those things are of benefit: then cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cauterization with medicated cauteries that burn: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	Cauterization with acute burning medicine is such that you take one tooth of a gear, and strip it, and cut off its extremities on both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of pain at the time with a broad scalpel, until a place under the skin is made, in which the dense part is captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Insert it therefore under the skin, until it is hidden: then bind above it with a bandage of decent constriction, and leave it for fifteen hours; then undo it, and extract the tooth, and leave the wound two days, or three: afterwards put on it a plaster submerged in butter, until the place makes pus: then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to make it with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on Medicines for burning.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization of it with iron is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Fire cauterization, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a Clavulus: because the form of its head is like the form of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in the middle of it is a certain small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then put it on the place, and hold your hand: and you withdraw the iron little by little with speed: and let the quantity that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, as its middle.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand, so that the artery which is below is not burned, and there occurs a flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the plaster in salt water, and put it on the place, and leave it for three days: then put a plaster with butter: afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you want, cauterize this half of the skull with the edge of a second cauterizing knife.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of the incision of an artery in this half of the skull, not being old is a special property.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in the old half of the skull.
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat the half of the skull, with what we have said from the preceding cure, and what we have said in the divisions of ailments, and the treatment is not effective: and you see from the ailment that what we have said about the first cauterization with medicine or with fire does not suffice for it, then it is necessary to make an igneous cauterization, until it becomes white after you apply a sign above the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that: and put your hand in place of one, and press it until you cut the artery, and penetrate up to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	Truly it is necessary for you to beware of the continuity of the jaw, which moves during mastication, lest the side or nerve which moves it be burned, whence spasms occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And let this be above caution and beware of the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in the cutting of it there is fear, and especially for him who is ignorant of what he does, and is not careful, nor experienced: and he undertakes the operation with this from the beginning.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a reminder of the regulation of the flow of blood that occurs from an artery according to its own method, and in the place proper to this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	What if you see from the ailment that this cauterization is not sufficient for it, and you see the body of the weak one enduring a cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cauterization that we have spoken of in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a cauterizer having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the method of cauterizing for earache.
Caput VI.	Chapter Six.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold and it is treated with solutions and the rest of the treatment that we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then cauterization by fire: and this is what is called a puncture, whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then puncture it with that after its ignition all around the entire ear, as it is rotated: or around both, if pain is in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And stretch yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear for a little while, after you have marked the places with ink, and let the quantity of the cautery be ten punctures on the entire ear, or about that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the places until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the method of cauterizing for Colic.
Caput VII.	Chapter Seven.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Colic that is treated with cauterization is not except for the types which occur from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And it requires cauterization of the type that occurs from dryness and spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of colic with hiera and purgings and gargling and your treatment does not work, then it is necessary to cauterize the weak area with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little below the temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And put your cauterization on the opposite side from the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cauterium directly on the extremity of the ear above, under the horn of the head a little, and another on the temple: whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And put your hand with a cautery until the quantity of the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of a Cautery, and it is a type of knife, whose form has been described above: nevertheless it is not more refined than that little, as you see: and it should be a knife with a bit of excessive thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the place, with what has preceded, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in old Apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When the Apoplexy has become old, and you treat it with what we have said, and your medication is not effective, and the weak person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and a cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cauterization on the back of the head, according to what has preceded: and the method of the cauterization should be according to what has preceded.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the entire head of the weak person, and put on its back an emplaster of snail as described in the treatment of emplasters: and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This indeed is the method of Cautery: and do that according to the same order which I mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed by it, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.

Then shave the head of the weak person: afterwards cauterize it with a cauterization in the middle of the head, and with a cauterization on top of every horn of the head, and with a cauterization on its back, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you are afflicted with a disease of softening of the body in many places, and he is weak and unable to tolerate it, and the disease is strong: then cauterize him with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of the back, and the last one with a cauterization, until much of its skin is burned, and lift your hand.

Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery for this is according to two methods: either a cautery with fire or a cautery with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	For the cautery with fire, instruct the weak one beforehand that he release his eyelashes if he is of those who clean them until they stretch and become even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If however they prick it at its base: then bind its eyes with a thread, so that they do not move, until they heal.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore the healing and equalizing occur, then put the head of the weak one in your bosom: afterwards apply a mark above the eyelid of its eyes with encaustic, a mark which is according to the figure of the myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then put a piece of cloth soaked in egg white on the eye: or in a mucilage of psyllium above the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply cautery with a branding iron, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure that you marked little by little on many places, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of the myrtle leaf, appearing entirely as its own.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted, and the hair lifted up at the puncture of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Lift your hand then: and leave it for three days.

Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you move it as often as the sick person feels the biting of the medicine: for its biting penetrates like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore it perseveres that which it has found, the biting, then let go of the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting subsides, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid lifted, as it is lifted with contraction from fire, or with incision, it is good: and if not, then apply again upon it of the medicine on the place, where the medicine does not impress, and does not denigrate, until your operation is equal, and the eye is contracted.

Order the weak person to place his head on your lap, and let your assistant hold his head between their hands in such a way that it is not moved or agitated with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then put a cotton swab under the conjunctiva of the eye, or in the mucus of the eyelid above his eye: then apply the cauterizing iron, whose shape is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be hollow, in the shape of a quill pen from one end, with which the cauterization is made: and if you want it to penetrate up to the other end, and if you want it raised thus.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However this hollow one is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract the sanies from it, and clean it: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.

And hold your hand for a little while on the cauterizing iron near the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand is not burned, or the weak person is disturbed: and you put the cauterizing iron in the fat of the eye, and consume it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If I cauterize at the beginning up to the mouth, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization once or twice, if you judge that necessary: and diminish it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then put a plaster with butter, and treat it with an excoriating ointment, until it is healed.

Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct it to the place of the fistula, and probe it: then put into the same fissure a thin rod, that is, a subtle little tube, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of lead melted from a drachm, and hold your hand with the cane in good retention, and do not move the weak one at all, so that the melted lead does not run or penetrate to its eye.

Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a wonderful healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	What if the fistula is healed, with what we have said about cauterization, and cure, it is good.

When an apostema occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus and ruptures: afterwards it becomes chronic and the pus flows out and a fistula forms: then you treat it and if the treatment does not work, then it is necessary to apply a cautery according to the quantity that the fistula can hold.

Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the toothache is due to cold, or there is cold or worm in it, and treatment with medicines does not help: then cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with butter, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cauterization of it with butter is, that you take the butter of a cow, and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a metal vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take the scab, and apply it to the extremity of the aching tooth.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then submerge it in the boiling butter: and apply it quickly to the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools: then repeat it several times, until the power of the fire penetrates to the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, submerge a thread, or a scab in cold butter, and apply it to the aching tooth: and put on top of it a heated iron, until the fire penetrates to the depth of the hollow of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cauterization of it with fire is, that you direct a bronze or iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be in its body something of thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not penetrate to the weak tooth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then cauterize with fire, of which the form appears: and apply it to that tooth: and hold your hand, until the cauterization cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do that several times, for the pain will be relieved, either on that same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is fitting with the application of that cauterization, that the weak part of his mouth be filled with good butter, and that he hold it for one hour; then he spits it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the Cautery.

When the Strophulae are from phlegm and from cold humidities, and they do not obey digestion through medicines, and you use digestion of them quickly: then a cauterization with fire is concave, whose form is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, so that the smoke can go out at the cauterization from one extremity to the other: and put the ignited thing on the aposteme once, and a second time, if you apply it there, until it reaches the depth of the aposteme.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	Which if the aposteme is small: then put the cauterization according to the quantity of the aposteme.

Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the arm is dislocated because of humidities, and it does not return to its place from its dislocation within the hour, until it becomes accustomed to returning, then it becomes dislocated by a slight movement, which happens as we have already testified, then you should reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then let the weak person lie on his back, or on his healthy side.

Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And beware, that you do not proceed to the last in cauterization, and the thickness of the whole skin is burned, where the whole body is burned, and it perforates to the intestines: for the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the method of cauterizing the apostema of the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When there occurs an eruption, and you want to know, if that apostema is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, there enters a weak pain, and heaviness without sharpness: and if it is in the tunic of the liver, with pain there is vehement sharpness: and you see now, that it has wearied its physicians with its cure.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary therefore that the weak man breathes upon his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then figure the place of the apostema with a searing plaster: then ignite a cautery which is similar to a razor.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it one cautery, until the whole skin is burned, and it perforates to the siphac, until all the pus comes out: then cure it with the cure of eruptions, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary that this species of cautery be used, except by one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hands these sicknesses run with experimentation many times: then indeed he dares to undertake an operation of this kind.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But truly to leave it, is better for me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing in the Pleura.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said, a cauterization with the roots of aristolochia for a cold Pleurisy is done in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you take from the roots of the dry long aristolochia, one root which is longer than the others, and it should be the size of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then submerge it in oil: and set it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the connection of the jaw with the neck, and with two small cauteries under the guidance a little sloping towards the part, which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs sloping towards the back a little: and with one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries to the back: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades: and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be on the obvious skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some of the ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made from iron like a probe: and they ignite it, and insert it inside between the ribs, until it reaches with it to the same apostema, and the pus comes out: as we have said in the case of Epatis' apostema.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is a fear that either the weak person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII. On the method of cauterizing the Spleen.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat an illness of the spleen, with what we have said concerning curation in the division of illnesses, and your cure does not help, then a cautery on it is done in three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of them is to make three or four cauterizations in a line along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the liver's cauterizations, whose figure has preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between each cauterization an amount in thickness of a finger, or a little more.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of the cauterization be the one we mentioned for the liver cauterization equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cauterization, and let him be weak leaning on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: to hold the cauterization iron with two fingers, which we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder: and raise the skin that is opposite the spleen, where the weak left elbow penetrates: and let your elevation be what you use to raise the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two fiery irons together, until with them you penetrate the skin from the other side: then withdraw the cauterization iron: thus four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you should cauterize with another cauterization iron having three fingers.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care that the cauterization, after you have applied it, discharges pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than all the other things which have preceded in the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the method of cauterizing for Dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cauterization does not fall in Dropsy, except for hardened ascites.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a case of Dropsy with the methods of cure that we mentioned in the division, and the cure is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel, and one cauterization on the stomach, and another cauterization on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two cauterizations on the back between the vertebrae, and one opposite the breast, and another opposite the stomach: and let the depth of the cauterization be near to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then diminish the open cauterization so that it emits pus over a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And it does not reject the weak from cure after cauterization with it, for which two intentions ought to be applied to it, and healing will hasten to it with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be a clamp, according to the shape that has preceded it: and that with which the back is cauterized should be an olive, according to the shape that has preceded its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they have become abscessed in a dropsical person, and are filled with citrine water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the back of the foot in the nocturnal, which is between the ear and the ring finger: and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the citrine water will flow out, and the cautery should be according to this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make on each of the two legs two cauteries, and let the cautery be made with the extremity of a knife-like cautery: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and another below it, around the middle of the leg: and on all the thigh make two cauteries: and diminish the open cautery without cure for a long time: so that some water flows out from it: then cure it with the rest which we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of cauterizing for relief of the belly.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a solution of the belly from cold and humidities, until it debilitates the retentive and digestive virtues, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with modes of cure, and not healed: and you see the weak tolerant of cauterization of overflowing virtue, then cauterize it with a large cautery on its stomach, according to what has preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle clamp-like cautery: and a large cautery above the hips, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture and the weak tolerance of that, then cauterize it with a cauterizer on the chest and with a cauterizer on all of it; and perhaps you will add two small cauterizations near the great stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	It is indeed a advancing treatment, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from gross, cold, or corrupt humors, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment is not effective: then cauterize with three cauterizations on the lower vertebra of the back under the almeidati for a short time in a triangular shape, and cauterize under the navel almost two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face breaking out in pimples, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterizer, according to what has preceded: and cauterize on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a clavicular cauterizer: and apply an open cauterization for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing ulcers after the removal of them.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you remove ulcers, then prepare a cauterizer that resembles a razor.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited cauterizer into the ulcer that has been removed: and with your hand, until the cauterizer reaches the opening of the vein, from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many ulcers, then cauterize each one with a cauterizer according to what we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with that which is beneficial to them from ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cauterization iron on the alkatim, it is more so in the ulceration.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	Of the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the weak does not undergo surgical incision and operation that we have described in its proper place, and is frightened by it, perhaps it may be healed with a cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula happens to someone, and it becomes chronic, pus runs out of it, and corrupted moistures.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is worthy therefore that which ought to be done, that you should probe it with a subtle sound.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the quantity of its depth with the sound.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply a cautery iron, which is similar to a probe.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the ignited thing itself into the same fistula and the quantity in which the clamp entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cauterization over it, until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the quantity of your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And beware of the burning of the nerve, if it is there, or of the large vein: or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then beware of all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do that, unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think, that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If however the place is sealed, and matter is cut off from it, and it remains thus for a long time: then know that it is already completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if matter is not cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in its depth there is a corrupted opening, or something like that: whose mention will come in its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from thick flatulence and it is weakened because of that, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the alumethene over the kidneys themselves, to cauterize each kidney with a cauterizing iron, whose description has preceded.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we will cauterize it again on the same alumethene.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Three lines appear where it has been applied.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be more lasting in the healing.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness occurs in the bladder and softening from cold and humidities, until it does not retain weak urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the back above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic area begin, and cauterize with one on the right of the back and another on the left of it: and let the length of that cauterization be according to the quantity of a knot of the thumb: and cauterize it with the lower iron of the back, or two irons if you judge it necessary for it: and let it be according to what has preceded, the cauterizing iron.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and humidities occur in the uterus, and it is prevented by that from impregnation, and its menses are corrupted, and the arrival of them is delayed, and pain occurs to it upon their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize with three irons around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and cauterize above the lower part of the back with one iron, or two irons: and let the iron be a clavical one.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the shoulder in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucus humors flow to the ankle of the ankle joint and become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of it is that one leg is longer than the other, when they are compared together: and the place of dislocation is found empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the weak one above the ankle joint with a cautery similar to a circle: after you sign with a branding iron around the ankle joint, as it turns: and so that the ankle falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be one whose shape was described previously in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	Which if this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-tree cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of the whole skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cauterizing for sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the ankle joint and its causes are cold and humidity: and the weak one is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not work, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary to release the weak one from gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of the cautery in it is according to two methods: either a cautery with burning medications, or a cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cautery with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	Of which one is, that you cauterize above the ankle joint with three triangular cauteries, according to this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And give them a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between all cautery be of the quantity of the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be of olive oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle on top of the head of the ankle itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	There are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you use a cautery with a circle, whose form precedes the dislocation of the ankle, alone: so that it is a little circle containing the whole ankle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery for sciatica, when the pain adheres to the ankle itself, and does not extend to the hip and thigh.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends to the hip and thigh, then cautery it with two cauteries above the hip, above the place to which the weakness points, in which is the pain, and your cautery above the haunch four fingers towards the wooded part for a little while: and let the cautery be knife-shaped.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	What if the weakness indicates that the pain extends nearly to the toes of the foot, then cautery it there where it points with a cautery of one, two, three, or four, or more points, if it needs that.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if it indicates the pain is under the knee turning to the thigh, then cautery it there with one knife-shaped cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware to yourself in every cautery that you do, that you do not apply the cautery so as to burn a nerve, or a large artery, and draw out through it above the weakness a malignant tumor, or a contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I indeed have already seen one and another, of those who were cauterized above the haunch, and finished in the cautery, and the thigh became inflamed, until a tumor followed to the foot, and it was entirely perforated, and the entire foot was corrupted: thereafter there occurred a dissolution of the belly, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	What if there is pain in both parts at the same time, cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men have said regarding cauterization of the ankle, that this is the method of its cauterization.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar iron instrument, the diameter of which is half a palm, and at its orifice it should be as thick as a kernel of a date, or a little less, and inside that instrument let there be a third instrument.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between all the instruments be the size of a thumb knot, and let the instruments be open on both sides, and let their height be like a knot, or two knots, and make for them a handle from iron decently fitted to the instruments.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be ignited in the fire until it becomes red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed on a weak ankle lying on its side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Cauterize it therefore with three round cauterizations in one spot.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards apply a plaster with butter, and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis said, we have used this kind of cauterization little, on account of the terror of its appearance, and because we find few who expect benefit from it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is one of the good cauterizations for whoever endures it and finds its place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cauterization with adhering medicines is like this, that you make two instruments having a perforated armlet, into which descends a hinge of its door made from bronze or iron, the length of a wall, of which in height are two knots, or about that size.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space that is between both be the size of a finger's thickness, and let them be open at top and bottom, and let what they contain be joined together according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then remove it and place it on a plaster of anchusa, while the patient lies on their healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand strongly on the plaster of anchusa.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles from warm water, which has been heated with fire for a short time, and hold it for an hour's space of time: and let the patient tolerate its biting and burning, for he finds the biting as fire, until the biting calms.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the entire anchusa with sweet water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put on it butter, until the blackness of the burning is removed: and leave it for several days, and an ulcer will be cured from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the last resource in treatment.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	What if the pain extends to the hip or the leg: make for him a plaster that contains water, according to what you did with the anchusa equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of warm water: and I have already written it in the treatment of rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take of alkaline substance and unslaked lime, both one part: grind each, and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which is perforated with one small hole, according to the quantity that the radius may enter: and put under the bottom of the pot another pot vitreous: and throw on the alkaline substance and lime from sweet water, so that it submerges both with your finger: after which you press them with a good compression by your hand: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the vitreous pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect that water entirely, and throw it on another lime: and filter, until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	It will then be strongly active, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of the remaining members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And there are medicines with which they cauterize the ankle, such as these: tessie and mel of anacard, and chalk with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen told of a certain ancient cure of some man, by which the pain of the ankle and the vein of the thigh was cured: and he declared its value to be great.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it did not require another cure, and that he was healed by one remedy, until he told that he perhaps entered a bath of medicine, and came out of it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, that it be taken from the green of the seatragi, and if the green is not found, let the fresh and dry one be taken, and let it be ground much with some fat, and placed on the ankle, where there is pain, or on the leg, or on the hip: and let it be tied, and left for the quantity of three hours, or as long as he feels a weak sensation of burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put him into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes very moist, put him into the sun.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not necessary to use a cautery with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides said that the dung of capers, when with it the vein of the thigh is cauterized, helps it: and makes a cautery in this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let wool be ground, and imbued with old oil, and placed on the deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot, and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry dung of a goat and set it on fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on a woolen cloth and let it stay until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not stop doing that until the sensation is felt up to the knee and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called the cow-pox cauterization.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	On the cauterization of pain in the back.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs in the back for many reasons, or from a fall, or a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and wet material: and cauterization is not suitable, except in this single case, which occurs from the infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary therefore after evacuation to apply to the weak person with foul-smelling poultices, and similar things, so that they make on the back, where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the affected part, afterwards marking with a cautery iron in each line five cauterizations, or more according to the quantity which can be tolerated by the strength of the weak person: and let the cauterization be done with cauterized points.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauterizations, with a cautery iron in the middle of the shoulder, according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the method of cauterizing for the disease of gibbosity of the nape of the neck.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This sickness often happens to little children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of this disease in children is: that there occurs a narrowing on the breath during elevation and movement: and you find in the upper part of the spine of the back and its knobs, which already begins to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When I raise that and make it thus, then cauterize it with a cauterizer which is a circle in this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cauterization take hold equally over every part of the vertebrae: and if you cauterize around the vertebrae with a pointed cauterizer two or three lines: and let the points be close to one another.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you apply the cauterization on a hump that forms in the spasm of a nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing for gout and pains of the joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of the joints are from cold humidities, which flow to whichever members of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is by custom of physicians to call that specifically Gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore a cold gout is being treated with methods of treatment and the pains are not removed, then cauterization removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is that you should cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauterizers: and let the cauterization be with an oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	Its form is this.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you indicate that there are points on the surface of the foot, then make them with a pointed cauterizer.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	Which if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it on every knee with three cauterizers, or four on every side, with this same cauterizer of the ankle.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If however many of these cauterizations are necessary for you, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not insert your hand with the cauterizer, but rather to the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however the pains ascend to the knees and the back, then administer what we have said from the cauterizer in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	What if there are pains in the hands only, then punctures around the focus, as two lines revolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If however pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, a point above each knot, and above the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If however pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the weak from a good regimen, from the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is made, and the phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the aid of God by this cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of rupture.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine descends, or a hernia to the testicle, and it is beginning nearby: then it is necessary to advise the weak person to omit purging on that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives, so that feces may descend from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and command him to hold his breath, until it comes out, or the hernia or intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a cauterization under the rupture above the bone of the hip, with a sign whose extremities are similar to the middle of a circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then ignite the cauterium, which is of this form, until it becomes white, and throws out sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or hernia to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the servant place his hand over the spot, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the thighs of the weak person, and put a cushion under it, and one servant holds the thighs of him, and another holds his chest who holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then apply the cautery on that same sign, your hand with the cautery standing upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it, until you have obtained a mouth with it, or repeat it with it twice or thrice, if you have not succeeded with it at first even unto the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine at the time of your cauterization, lest you burn it, and an issue comes out through that above the weak part or a sore or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not succeed with the cautery to the mouth, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is proper that the cautery for infants be subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat with the remaining ointment, until it has healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the weak person lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is proper that you put nourishment for it for the length of time of its cure, which will soothe its stomach, so that the intestine does not come out at the anus and vomiting.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a well-made bandage, and let him hold it for forty more days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should be kept from labor, and from fullness of food and drink, and vehement voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, thus he is healed with a complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the cure for hernias with an incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When however hernias occur in the remaining belly, and are beginning, and it is not possible to add them, then cauterize the hernia with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let that which is applied be about one third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat it with what we have said, and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some of the first ones have already said that a hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with a cautery, and a line is applied which runs along the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And put your hand in the middle with the cautery on the clavele.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the method of cauterizing for pains resulting from a fall or a blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in certain limbs from a fall or blow, and the pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize with a puncturing cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery be for each limb a second cautery according to its size, and its own slightness, and weakness, and its own power, and the location of the twisting and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat it over the same cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Since it is customary with these pains that they are transferred from one limb to the one that is nearest to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Wherefore it is necessary to follow them with a cautery until the weak part is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the method of cauterizing for leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Lepers are sometimes helped by a large cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy which occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: when therefore you consider treating it with a cautery.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the leprosy is beginning, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it does not decline, nor does it remain: and you apply above the weak part which comprehends the corruption above the entire complexion of it: then cauterize him above the head with five cauteries: one on the middle knot of the head, and a second below that towards the front at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind above the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally put your hand with the cautery briefly, until it impresses a small impression on the mouth, and the cortices will be dislocated from it: so that the expiration of gross vapors is alleviated from it, and cauterize with the cautery also over the spleen itself, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread over the weak part, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary to cauterize with those cauteries that we mentioned in the head, and to cauterize over the extremity of the nose, and with two cauteries over the two jaws, and with two cauteries over the vertebrae of the neck, and six over the vertebrae of the back, and one large one over the prominence near the tailbone and one over it, in the same alumead: and two over the shoulders: namely one over each shoulder, and two over the knees: one over each knee, and two over the shoulders, and two over the elbows, and two over the tenderness of its chest: and cauterize over every joint, of the joints of its hands and feet: and cauterize over every heel of its feet, and the soles of its hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware for yourself of the nerves that are above the posterior part of the heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when a cauterization is made with a cautery over the bone of the breast, and another over the bone of the stomach, and another over the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you apply the cautery, the greater is the benefit, and the more it helps.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the weak person does not find pain in the cautery, as the healthy ones do: because his body is already numbed.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries be of a size and smallness according to the limbs and joints: according to what has preceded regarding the types of iron instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat with a cautery made from the powder of the herb with honey, and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of Gangrene.
Caput L.	Chapter L (or Head/Chapter 50)
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any limb is affected with gangrene and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize the affected limb with cauteries, according to what the size of the limb deserves or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery penetrate into the thickness of the skin for a short time.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when the gangrene is cauterized on that which occurs to the hand and foot, at the joints of the back near the exit of the nerves, which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But it does not presume above that, except for one who is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the method of cauterizing for Barbers itch.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Barbers itch becomes chronic and nothing from the resources of medicine is effective for it: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the powder of the herb and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon's blood, and dove's blood: let each be one part: mix all these things, and apply them to a cloth, and adhere to the place, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterizing for a Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When a cancer is beginning and you wish to restrain it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	The wise men have said that it should be cauterized with a final cauterization in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	It does not seem to me, for I fear that it will become an ulcer, and I have already seen that happen many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterizing in cases of scalding.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has a scald and it is delayed in maturing, either because of the excess that causes it or because of the age of the weak person when he is decrepit and has little blood, or because of the time and the need to hasten the maturing of the scald, then cauterize around its circumference with many small points.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it alone.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten the maturing by itself.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If you want to make a perforation of it with a cauterization iron, then ignite the cauterization iron, whose shape is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the scald, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cauterization be from that which follows, that the flow of pus may be relieved.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the method of cauterizing for a corrosive ulcer.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corrosive ulcer is nothing but a corruption that walks in a member and corrodes it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If you see a corrosive ulcer in a place that can tolerate a cauterization with fire, then make many cauterizations, small and large iron rods, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosive ulcer is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it on every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains deeply.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then touch the same place for three days, and apply over the cauterized area a mixture of sulphur and oil, until all the scabs are eradicated and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then heal it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days flesh is born with healthy birth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then apply the cautery again over that which remains of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	The corroding is treated with sharp medicine whenever it becomes necessary.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	It itself rises in place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	But indeed a cautery with fire is of quicker aid: and I have already spoken of its cauterization with sharp medicine in the division: therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterizing in pimples and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	It often happens that this disease occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a coarse, foul thing, which hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed the cautery for them is according to two methods: a cautery with fire, and a cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for the one with fire, it is like a hollow cautery of a bird's feather, which is made from iron, according to the quantity that the nail contains on all sides: and let its edges be subtle.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then apply it ignited over the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then move the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery penetrates to the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then plaster it with woodland marshes, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster over it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its own roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with a generating ointment of flesh, until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	What if these are not turned and often happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then you will administer to them a cauterization with hot water: and it is, that you take a small tube made of bronze, or iron, or a feather quill: and apply it to the nail, or the scar.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then throw into the tube a small quantity of hot water: hold your hand and turn it with compression of your hand for a little while, so that the margin of the tube is impressed on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the weak one wait a little upon the biting of the hot water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release it, for the nail is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with them one after another, until you come to all of them that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they have been eradicated, with what generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the method of cauterizing for the Tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When there happens to someone a Tremor from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or another: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauterizations, or five on the vertebrae of the back, and between all the vertebrae a cauterization, and on his chest a cauterization, and on his stomach a cauterization.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For the Tremor is stilled with an oily cauterization, and it hastens health from cold sickness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the method of cauterizing for Albahtir (also known as Al Zahrawi or Albucasis
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When there are expelled from the body of Albucasis foul things, that is, pimples, which are made from corrupted thick matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is necessary therefore in the beginning when it appears, that they should be cauterized on every part of the head with a subtle cauterization of myrtle wood, whose ends have been ignited with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lens-shaped cauterization.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized with an adamant, at the beginning of its expulsion according to this method: and it does not increase: and the excess is broken, making them, and it heals from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	Nevertheless it is necessary that it be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Of the method of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that there is a flow of blood from an artery which has been cut at the wound, which occurs externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or at the cauterization of a limb, and similar things to these: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When therefore it happens to anyone, then put your hand quickly to the orifice of the artery, and place your index finger on it: and press it strongly, until the blood is stopped under your finger, and does not go out from it at all.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put small olive cauterizations on the fire, and a large number of them: and blow upon them, until they are ignited strongly.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, either small, or large, according to the wound and the place, where the artery is disrupted, and put the cauterization on the vein itself, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cauterization, until the blood is stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	Which if it is expelled when the finger is lifted from the orifice of the artery, and the cauterization is extinguished, then quickly take another cauterization, from the cauterizations which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	I will not cease to do that one thing after another until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you confuse the nerve which is there, and a malicious accident happens to the weak place.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or let it be tied with a strong ligature thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or let medicines of the proper property be placed on it, which are to cut off blood, and be tightened with a decent constriction poultice.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	He who administers the cutting off of it with a ligature, and tightening with a bandage, or application of cauterizing things, and similar, does not harm it deeply, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to anyone and there is not a doctor present to him, nor medicine: then let him begin with the placing of the index finger on the mouth of the vein itself, as we have described, and a strong constriction of it, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed from on top of it with water of vehement cold, always, until the blood coagulates and thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, let him consider what it needs from a cautery or from medicine.

Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Book of Surgery of Albucasis, Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	Of the Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and their similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have described in the first chapter, every kind of illness for which it is suitable to combine with fire a cauterization and a burning medicine, and its opportunities, its causes, its instruments, and the forms of cauterizations.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have set forth chapters from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter by the same method: that the investigator should investigate what is being sought.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, O sons, what in this chapter is that which is from the terror of what is in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that, it is necessary that there be a more vigorous caution, since in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation often occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision over an apostema, or opening of a cyst, or cure of an ulcer, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which are associated trembling, and fear, and death often occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest what is hesitant falls upon you, for sometimes men of such a kind fall to you in this art with kinds of weaknesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there is one who becomes angry with his own illness, and death is easy for him: on account of the vehemence of what he finds from his weakness and the length of his suffering.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And an illness is from fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And there is one who gives his attention to you, and says it to you, hoping for health, and his illness is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it is not necessary that you consent to him who comes to you from those whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more vigorous than your greed and your rapaciousness.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume anything about it, unless after certain knowledge, which proves to you that which leads to successful treatment.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And that you use in the cure of all your weaknesses, prognosis and indication of that to which health is more suitable.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in it is to you assistance for acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with His understanding, and may He not withhold from you guidance and inspiration: for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have indeed arranged this Chapter by distinguishing the chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: so that may be alleviated for you what you want from it, and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the cure of water that accumulates in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this weakness often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightly grasps the head of the child without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And it also happens sometimes from a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have indeed not seen this illness in others than in children: and for every one of them whom I saw, death hastened: therefore it seemed to me that it was advisable to omit the operation in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have indeed seen one of them, a child, whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until he could not sit up by himself, because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased, until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed either accumulates between the skin and the bone: or accumulates under the bone above the brain.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on it, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make a single incision in the middle of the head, in width: and let the length of the incision be about two knots, until the moisture flows out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the humidity is greatly increased and the apostema is larger, then put two fissures, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the humidity is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the commissures of the head open on every side, and water is pressed out when you press it with your hand inward, and it is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you find in the middle of the head three fissures, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract the whole humidity.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the fissures with bandages and poultices.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then anoint it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then undo the bandage, and cure the wound with dressings and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not cease to bind the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the weak one with all dry food of little humidity, until the member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is, that you consider where appears the magnitude of the apostema, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Make an incision therefore where it appears to you that the apostema and collection of water are, and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And beware, lest you cut the artery, and there occurs a flow of blood, and the weak one dies from that flow with an evacuation of humidity.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	On the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter Two.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When there occurs to someone a cataract to the eyes, or to the breast, and it grows old, and the cure of medicines does not help: then the last cure is in that, an incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore when one wishes to make an incision on them, that the weak head should be shaved.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the weak one constrict his neck, with any cloth of his.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are places which are behind the ears and depressed: and are rarely hidden, except in certain men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with cauterization above both: and make an incision on both with a sharp spatula on both sides, the incision reaching to the mouth: and let it be according to the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and make an incision upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be about two fingers joined.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood comes out with a pulsating discharge, which jumps inward with a frequent leap.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the quantity of a space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with cauterization, and probe until you reach the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what is necessary to emit from blood, is six ounces, and perhaps you will emit more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All that according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the weak person and the fullness of their artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the ulcer.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains at the mouth from the abscess, then cut it, so that a hot aposteme does not occur: then constrict the ulcer with linen threads from a linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with an ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an old headache occurs to a man, or sharp catarrh due to acidic humidities and heat in the temples, or an old swelling, and things similar to them: and it is treated with modes of curative medicine, and it does not help: then we are experienced in these diseases in the extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we will narrate.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the mode of operation in extracting them, is that he should shave the weak hairs that are on the temples, and aim at the apparent artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	It itself is shown to you by its own pulse, and is rarely hidden except in few men, or by the swelling of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	What if it is hidden from you, then he should bind his head tightly with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or fumigate the place with hot water, until it appears to you with a clear appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I formed a little before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scratch the skin with it with ease, until you penetrate to the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw a hook into it, and pull it out upwards, until you pull it out of the skin, and make it emerge from the tunics that are under it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is delicate, then entwine it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it a part according to the quantity by which its extremities are lengthened and contracted, and there does not occur a flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut and if it is not severed, the blood does not rise at all.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then let out from the blood about six ounces, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large, then you should tie it in two places with a double thread, strong, of silk: or of a chord of alhohod, so that putrefaction does not come to it before consolidation of the wound, and there occurs a flow of blood.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the redundancy which is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you use it, cauterize it with a cauterizer up to the mouth, with a razor-shaped cauterizer, until its extremities are cut and it will stay in place for the same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better work, unless he who undergoes it has a fever or is of a hot complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cauterizer is one of those things which help to end moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cotton, and powders well made should be put on top of it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the dressing, it should be treated with dry medicines which make flesh grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If meanwhile while you are operating there occurs a flow of blood from the artery, then quickly cut it with a cauterizer or fill the place with cotton, and constrict your hand until the bleeding is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	What if none of those things are present to you, then put your finger on the place until the blood coagulates.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And moisten the place with water of vehement cold, until the acute pain is stilled and constricted according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from what is lighter and easier than the extraction of the artery, it is to cauterize the vein with this razor-shaped cauterizer having two blades: let the sharpness be similar to the pumice stone.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However they are much less sharp than the two razor blades.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are as sharp as the two razors, then cold will quickly seize both, and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When there is some thickness in them, heat of fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: when this work is done it is better than any work, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space that is between two clamps be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with cauterization; and apply both heated cauteries, until they reach the mouth, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between the extremities may protrude.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they are not consolidated with this cauterization thoroughly.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cauterium.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of a flow of tears from the eyes, with repeated ulcers.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are constant tears, and their flow is from the veins which are on the outside of the skull above the head: and no medicine can cure them with medical treatment, and you see the face of the weak already red, and he feels in his forehead a crawling, as is the crawling of ants: and his eyes are tired, moist, so that their lashes are already corroded by corrosion: and his eyelids are inflamed from the sharpness of tears: then the ancients have indicated for their cure this operation, and they have named it cure with Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is that you should advise the weak person to shave the hairs which are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut on the forehead three equally distant fissures along the length of the forehead: and let the length of the fissure be about two fingers, and one fissure be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the arms, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries which are in both sides: and stretch out your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all incision be the quantity of three joined fingers: and have for yourself a piece of prepared sponge, or many dried cloths, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a spatula of two sharp extremities, whose following shape is a moxa.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is on the temporal side, up to the second incision: and excavate with it the whole skin, which is between the two incisions, with a sifac, which is above the mouth.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this spatula, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp cultellum, blunt on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And put its sharp side towards the flesh joined with the skin, and its blunt side towards the mouth: and push it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels, which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after a quantity of blood has flowed out equal, press out the places from the clots of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put into every fissure a plaster made from old cotton, and put over them little balls soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see to it that hot apostema does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the ligament, and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with royal ointment, and other things which are used to treat wounds: until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the treatment of sharp tears and discharges from the eyes from the interior of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When there occur to someone sharp and acid discharges, corrosive, constant: and you see his eyes weakened, pale, and already their appearance is debilitated: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and in the depth of the head is sharp pain, laesing, and consequent sneezing: then conclude from these accidents, that these matters and discharges do not come, unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is that you should order the weak to scratch their own forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut in it a single fissure in the middle of the forehead, or another one across its width, and start with the fissure from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be up to the bone: and stretch your hand from the muscles of the temples, which move during mastication: until when the bone is laid bare: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with a cotton thread, or with a linen thread.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tie above with little pads: and soak the pads with wine and oil, so that hot apostema does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you untie it, and you see that the hot apostema has already begun to diminish: then it is necessary that you rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a regimen of excitation that makes flesh grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of rose oil: and prepare from them an plaster, and administer to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On the treatment of that which falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or similar to stone, such as iron and glass: or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans: or it is a flowing thing, such as water and vinegar, and things like them: or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone falls into the ear, or a kind of stone from those that do not adhere, nor grow in the ear, expose the Ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then instill into the Ear something from violet oil, or from sissamino.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make sneeze with the condisi, and stop up the nostrils with a dressing at the time of sneezing, after you put in the opening of the ear fragments of cloth, or wool, and stretch the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For it often comes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	And if it does not come out, then administer the extraction of it with Gest, that is, with fine Pizigarolis: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out with Gest, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a fine hook, bent at the end, of little doubling.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not come out by that, then make a tube of bronze, and introduce the extremity of the tube into the opening of the ear much, and stop up what is in the circumference of the tube with wax softened with oil, so that there is no passage except for the tube: then extract with your blowing attraction forcibly.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For it often comes out with what we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If however it does not come out in this manner: then take from helkalimbat, or from visco, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and put it at the extremity of the staff after you have wrapped around it a bandage decently placed: then introduce it into the opening of the ear with facility, after you have freed the ear from humidity.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have described, then proceed to the cutting, before there occurs an aposteme of heat, or a spasm.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the manner of the cutting is, as in phlebotomy the weaker vein first in the head: and let out from him blood according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the weak one sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and find a small cutting in the root of the ear at its fat in the depressed place itself: and let the cutting be of a lunar figure, until you reach the stone: then remove it with that which is possible for you from instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then with speed and care treat the fissure until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	What if a thing falls into the ear is from one of the grains which grow and become inflamed then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not come out to you at the exit, then take a thin, subtle spatula of this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the cutting off of that species of grains which fall into the ear and do not do that when you think that grain has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear until you put many a poultice: then extract them with forceps or with a subtle instrument or with suction as we have said, for the extraction of it will be alleviated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water which enters into the ear, it is necessary that he uses a weak blowing with condensing at first: and now he has filled his ear with some old cottar: and it lies upon that ear in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, gentle, and heat them with fire for a little while, and gently insert one of them into the opening of his ear: and let him jump on his foot on that side, and strike with another stone above the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore do not cease to do that with stone and stone until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water comes out thus, that you take a parsnip or a juniper and insert one extremity of it into the ear: and burn the other extremity with fire until it is greatly charred.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another juniper and do that many times until all the water comes out: and extract it with a cannula according to what was previously said regarding the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal that enters into it, if it is small in body, such as a frog, and similar to it, treat it as I have said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of large body, which appears to the sense: then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks: and its matter is easier than all those that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division, and in the treatment of distillations, and your treatment does not work: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If, therefore, something appears there from worms, then extract it with forceps, or with subtle hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, whose form is this, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the subtle extremity into the ear according to the quantity that the weak part tolerates: then suck with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do it many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If, however, they do not obey you to exit, then stop up the surroundings of the cannula with wax, as I said regarding the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	What if they do not come out with what we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancients have already experienced in the infection of worms: and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring be what you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it of silver, or of copper, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let it be then that the pusher which is in the concavity of the cannula, is made from copper, bent sideways.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you use it, take a rod and insert cotton into its extremity with a suitable insertion: then pour oil, or juice, or what you wish of these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then introduce the rod with the cotton above, and express it with your hand with tempered compression, until the oil is pushed into the concavity of the hearing, and the weak part feels it inside: and what is poured into the ear, should already be warmed with fire for a short time: and beware lest there be something that distills into it cold mucus: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of an injury to the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes some infants are born from their mothers' wombs not perforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it has already happened to some men that an obstruction occurred in the channel of the ear from a wound or flesh grown in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this obstruction is sometimes made in the deep opening of the ear, which sight does not reach: and sometimes it happens at the outer opening of the ear, and sight reaches it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which occurs in the deep ear, and which the gaze does not comprehend, is in many cases difficult to cure.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which the sight reaches, you should place the ear of the infirm person in the sun, and look into it: then if you see the obstruction appearing, open it with a spatula, the shape of which is this which follows, let its extremity be where there is a small width, whose part is acute: and let the rest of the spatula be of two smooth sides: so that it does not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If the obstruction is from flesh grown in the ear's opening, then take it with a subtle hook, and cut it with gentle violence, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the obstruction is in the deep ear, then take a subtle and smooth wire, warm it with fire for a little while: then put it into the ear's opening.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you perceive the obstruction with this, that the infirm person feels with a heaviness of hearing, try to open it with ease: and beware, lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put into the ear a dressing according to the quantity of the width of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days, until you are secure about the consolidation of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Take a piece of linen cloth and soak it in rose water, and sprinkle powdered tragacanth over it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear has already formed a postule: then it is necessary to extract the linen cloth, and allow it to remain with another cloth, which you will have wrapped in a kerchief made with rose oil, until the hot postule subsides: then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If a flow of blood should happen: then submerge a sponge or cloths in cold water and apply it to the ear: and use the remainder of the treatment which stops the flow of blood as described in the treatment of distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelids with nightshade.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the nightshades that occur on the eyelids of the eye, when they are moist and when they are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	It is necessary therefore to pull them with forceps, or with a needle, and to cut them with scissors from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then apply powdered tragacanth to the places.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a subtle lentiform cauter.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of granulations of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It often happens on the eyelids something which resembles a grain in its solidity and hardness, and because of that it is named a granule: and it is an aggregation of thick humidity on the upper and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation therefore for them is, that you should examine whether the granule proceeds from what appears on the eyelid, and moves to every part, and its treatment is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Find then an incision above it in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from every part with ease, until it is hollow.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If however the cutting away of it is not prepared for you, unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then it harms the weak one in something.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	What if the incision is large: then bring it together with a suture: and treat it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For an ointment restores it, and fleshes it over.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if a polyp is hanging towards the interior of the ear turned to the inner surface, then invert the eyelid, and hang the polyp with a hook: besides which you need an incision, and press it from every part.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	What if the eyelid is lengthened by an incision, it does not harm it in anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the polyp, with salt water: and treat the place with that which fleshes over, until the weak one is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a tumor that generates in the tissues of the upper eyelid: and it happens most to children: and it weighs on their eyes, and they are afflicted with discharges in the mornings, and they cannot look at the light of the sun, because tears flow to them, and because of this you see them always rubbing their faces, and sleeping on them, and their eyelids are humid under their eyebrows, which an inflammation has already covered: and a visible sign of Axirnath is to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its operation is that the weak person puts their head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare on it ligatures, and make from that thread a circle according to the quantity that the instrument contains on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put it above it, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the instrument gathers in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that humidity with a spatula by making an incision through the width, and let not the incision be greater than what is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you cut the skin entirely, until you reach the instrument, for in many dispositions the instrument proceeds from the incision according to the shape of a piece of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extract it then with a cloth, which you had inserted between your fingers to the outside, and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and beware, lest you put in the incision, so that you do not reach with the spatula to the eye, and harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If however the instrument does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you put a little into the incision with ease, until the instrument proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and put them on the place, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are men who pound salt, and put it in a concavity of the incision, so that it dissolves what remains of that humidity.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however a hot abscess forms in the place, then treat it with cooling plasters, until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the modes of relaxing the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft, whence it happens that it protrudes as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional hairs grow in the eyelids of the eye beyond the normal course under the natural hairs, and become long: then they themselves harm the eye, and cause various diseases to occur, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and a white spot, until it becomes the cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And the diseases of the eye are treated in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or diseases are cured by Ataxmir through incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with a tube, as I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the weak one on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn back the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is thus turned back, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce the needle into it, where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it back with the thread.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find on the inner part of the eyelid under the additional hairs with the spatula going from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread, and put under the eyelid a small cotton ball from cotton, or a piece of cloth: then mark above the eyelid with ink, which should be in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: because that already varies among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are some in whom it is necessary to make an incision from the eyelid a large quantity, according to the quantity which becomes soft from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the spatula find above the two lines that you marked, and begin at the larger tear duct up to the smaller tear duct, and let there be a single fissure near the natural hairs, just as is the thickness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape out the whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture, with a needle and thread of fine wool: and wipe away the blood, and make adhere what overflows from the threads above the two eyebrows, with certain soothing things, if you want to do that: and if not, do not trouble.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads until three days, or four: afterwards cure it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is elevated at the time of the wound's sigillation and its closure: but the future one will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of curing the Ataxmir was taught by the ancients.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern for the weak, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method for the Ataxmir is also: and it is that you mark on the eyelid a figure which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate or joined hooks, according to this shape which follows, then cut away what overflows with small forceps, according to this shape, with equality of the incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not suffice: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct: and bring together between your fingers the threads with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then elevate your hand to the level of elevation and elevate the skin over which the scar is marked, as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and cure it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If a tumor or an aposteme occurs at your incision or your fissure: but apply that aposteme with a plaster, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelids also happen to convert their hairs.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary therefore that you use what we have said on the incision: but the suture of both is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the treatment of ataxmia with canes doesn't translate well, a better translation would be: On the cure
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and split the fissure which is within, according to what I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then skillfully make two canes, or two thin little wooden rods: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and the width of them is less than the width of a spatula: and you have already made an incision at the extremities of both from both parts where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then bring together both with subtlety over that which exceeds from the eyelid of the eye, and tie the two canes from both parts tightly, and leave it for some days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin that is tied will die, and become black, and rot, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then it is delayed, then cut it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then cure it, until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is elevated: and the hairs do not protrude.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of the two canes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the removal of painful piles from the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation on it is, that you take a subtle needle, and insert into it a thread from fine silk, thinly.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then you will gather its ends, and tie each knot with a subtle knot very firmly: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then you will put on the Alinxotati another subtle thread under it briefly, and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then the weak one will put his head on your lap, and it should be near the sun so that the operation may be declared: since it is a subtle operation, or a minor one.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then you will insert the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you extract from above the natural pile.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then you will pull the pile up to the Alinxotati: and insert into the Alinxotati that pile: if it is one, or two, or three, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then you will pull your hand with it, until the pile goes out with the Alinxotati from the eyelid with the natural pile.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If the Alinxotati is pulled and the pile does not go out with it: you will pull the Alinxotati downwards, with the thread that you put in it, until the Alinxotati goes out from the upper hole, and you see it with the sight of the eye: then you pull the Alinxotati, and the thread: and extract both, and close the eye: and keep it closed for two days, or three, until the pile adheres to its place, and flesh is born on top of it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the pile is short, then you will attach to it a long pile from the natural piles, and remove it with that: or leave it until it comes out after a space, and then remove it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental, therefore, occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or a cut, or a cauterization, and similar to those.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation in it is, that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and you put between them a linen pad, and you bind it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not proper to use in the cure of it things that dry and constrict, for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was; instead use in it things that soften, such as fenugreek: and apply with water, in which has been cooked althea, flaxseed: and anoint with dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some oil: and wrap with it a linen pad, and cure with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your cure is that you strive with all ingenuity, that it not be consolidated, according to the shape which it had at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation that we have spoken of, is not anything but a certain correction of the Alxatrati, so that the shape of the place does not return to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs on the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which occurs below is that which is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or a tear, or a cauterization, and those similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and you insert it into the flesh, and you make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread passes through both extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the figure of the eyelid returns according to what is proper, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a rasp, and put it in the cleft, and shape the eyelid with it: and make two clefts on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two clefts be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is formed from them: until when they are gathered the figure of them becomes this figure, and it is the letter lambda of the Greek alphabet.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh in quantity, which is its sharp lower width, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts: sew it with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, concerning softening medicines and plasters, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a fistula occurs from the cleft, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you find a flat cleft under the hair of the eyelids, also according to what has preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a plaster, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the discussion about the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that the operation runs in it according to what is prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it itself is of many diversities in form: and the prudent artisan prepares his skill with whatever method is possible for him, so that he makes the figure return to its natural form, or near it, and the infirmity itself, according to what is convenient for him from the operation and instruments in multiple arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Of the adhesions of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many men, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore you should insert the extremity of a probe under the eyelid and elevate it upwards; or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a subtle spatula, which is not sharp in its incision, but rather blunt for a short time: so that the weak place is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and cuts the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you were excavating the adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Pour then salty water into the eye, and wash it with water: or distill into it a distilled product made from dissolved zinc oxide and water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and eye with a linen thread: and put over the eye a woolen cloth soaked in the white of the egg: and after the third day use the aforementioned ointment, and the consolidations, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Of the incision of the nail and the prominence of the flesh of tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is in two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nerve-like: and is similar to a hard, subtle callus.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nerve-like, similar to the humidity of frozen white substance: which when touched with iron, or a hook tries to seize it, it is cut off, and the hook does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types do not begin except from the larger tear duct, until which it advances gradually, until it covers the pupil, and prevents light and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on it is that the weak person should place their head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open their eyes, and elevate the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with the claw of a pair of pincers, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a thread from the hairs of a horse, or an ox, or a cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle for a short while, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scratch the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were sewing it with the thread up to its very back.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a subtle spatula, or with small forceps: and distinguish the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that there does not occur from the cutting a continual flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with pincers alone: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scratch it with a blunt spatula, whose shape is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the spatula touch the horny tunic, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the cutting, throw into the eye something of ground salt, or made from ginger, and distinguish it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary, until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	For if the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor can a claw be fixed in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicines, and healed as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	For if you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the weak person, and take a subtle, blunt, and not very sharp spatula, according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scratch the nail from above with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	What if you see that it is rarefied and shattered, and the file impresses on the eye, then distill from your hour in the eye, either with lapis or with rubie, or with tritum salt: and cover the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation over it, until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot abscess in your eye to the contrary: then cease it, and cure the abscess, until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation over it with scraping, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The flesh of the tear duct, if it harms the eye with great annoyance, should be suspended with a hook, and a portion of it cut away: and do not make the incision ultimate, so that the flow of tears is not interrupted.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then pour into the tear duct either rubie, or made from lapis, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	There is born in certain eyes of men a red flesh, either composite or superficial, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps converts the eyelids to the outside: and it is like the rose called balaustine.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation for it is also that the weak one places his head on your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with hooks converging to it: and hold it with one forceps, or tongs.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh at first, until the whole of it is finished with the incision.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, so that you do not harm it during the operation: and let your incision be what you cut with, or with the spatula, which we described in the incision of the nail: or with small forceps, with which the tissue is collected, according to the form that will come after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When the incision is completed and the entire white cataract is removed, then fill the eye with powdered salt, or instill into it red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines, and put on the eye a poultice of defrored cotton with the whites of eggs, so that it may be secured from hot apostema.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If something of the cataract remains and hot blood dominates you, and a hot apostema threatens, then leave the eye and cure it with that which settles the apostema.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the treatment over it until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do likewise with the flesh that grows in the eye from this condition.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you delegate the cure of every weak eye to its natural or accidental disposition, operating with iron: and do not insert your hand in any of these operations until you see that the member can tolerate that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On the collection of pus from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Pus are red veins that gather on the eye and prevent its proper function, and weaken the eye over time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which there is pus, is strong and does not have any other disease besides the pus, then collect its pus.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is that you order the weak person to put their head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook or two according to your judgment and let the hook be a subtle duplication, or let there be two hooks graduated on one shaft.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with subtle forceps with subtlety, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and dissolved, and beware lest you wound the eye with the extremities of the spatula.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and you should be firm in your operation indeed: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have excavated, then distill into the eye either a green or a red liquid: so that its acidity eats away what remains of the cataract.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If however it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye with what soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for some days, until the pain of it subsides: and it is secure from the hot aposteme: then repeat over it the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of the nose to its proper shape.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call it Arissati's fistula, which you will treat with a cautery, or with corrosive medicine, according to what its description has previously stated.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no ingenuity in it: except that you find a gathering of pus above the aposteme at its birthplace, and extract all the humidity which is in it and the pus, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see in it a corruption or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the Asper of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made from Indian iron, and let its head be round like a grindstone, which is dotted with the dotting of a file, or the dotting of a fine awl: and put it on the corrupted place of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand for a little while, until you know that the corruption has already been scraped: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicines which are astringent and contracting.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If then the place is consolidated, and flesh is born in it, and the flow of blood is cut off: and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and is not apostemated, and no accident happens to it: then you should know that it is already healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no ingenuity in it, except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you scrape the bone with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is scraped, then take an instrument according to this form, let it be a metal extremity, triangular: and its wood is a pyramid extended to the extremity, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then put that on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and stretch out your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the instrument, until it penetrates the bone, and the weak one feels it: by that which he finds the air coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Then restore the place with medicines, astringent and drying, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When then flesh is born, and the place is hardened: then the matter that was flowing to the exterior, returns to the nose: it is then lighter on the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the reduction of the prominence of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with its entire mass, and no harm or diminution happens to the sight: then it is necessary that you relieve the weak one: then you bleed him: afterwards you put cups on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put on the eye an ointment that is made from acacia, and aloe, and olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tie the eye above with a plaster and many poultices.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of poultices is that you take many soft cloths and fold each cloth four times: make many of them: then put one on top of another, a second according to the quantity that the eye needs: then tie over them with a hard cloth tightly.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the applications with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the applications, and bind the eye tightly by day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If however the bandage is again softened, then it is necessary that it be tied firmly: then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye already returned to its own coat, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and poultices, and binding, and applications, until it be healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the incision of the conjunctiva.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When there occurs a disruption in the conjunctiva, then it protrudes and comes out from between the eyelids like a grain of the conjunctiva, and the appearance of the man is disfigured because of that, and he wants to cut it: then the operation for it is, according to what I will describe: and it is, that you insert a needle at the root of the conjunctiva from the lower part to the upper.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle where there is a double thread on the tear duct side, and make it penetrate: and leave the first needle according to its own position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the conjunctiva around the needle: and tie it tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the needle, and put over the eye a soft woolen cloth on the white of the eye: and leave it, until the thread falls out with the conjunctiva.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with what comforts it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the wound is constricted on all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is perforated with a subtle spatula, which penetrates to the depth of the eye, and the white humidity flows out, and the eye sinks down, and enters at once: then constrict it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the treatment of cataract.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease which is called Alcomnati, is nothing but a cataract, which gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not the eye itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is, that you make the weak one sit on a prepared seat, or a directed one.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head of it with your hands on both sides, and move it, until you see the cataract pass to the lower parts of the eye.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is fixed, and does not come down, and the light is freed: and the weak one sees things as he used to see: and if it does not go down below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however the descent of the cataract is not prepared with what we have said, then make the weak one sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a subtle spatula, and probe with it above the corneal membrane slightly at the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the corona, until the cataract comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then let it be treated with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have mentioned the types of water in division, and what is suitable for perforation, as the speech declares and explains, then take that same one according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then therefore it is necessary that you make the weak person sit between your hands squarely, opposite to the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and press it firmly: then with your right hand, the eyelid of his eye, if the eye in which there is water, is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand the cataract needle, if the eye is the left one: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the point of the needle near the corona through the thickness of the radius in the same white part of the eye apparent with tearlessness of the lesser one: then push the needle with strength: and you withdraw with it your hand, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel, that the needle has now reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the length of the journey of the needle to the depth be the length of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the corona of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see it in the same pupil of the vision of the eye, on account of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the needle up to the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downward one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then the water descends at once, then the weak person sees that which is above what opens his vision at once, and the needle in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then the water descends, then put it down again, except that the needle should come out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When I raise the figure, and it does not rise: then extract the arrow with ease: and you will free your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something from clear salt of gem in water: and wash the infected eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put outside the whole eye a pledget or a cloth soaked in rose oil and eyebath white of egg: and tie it with that to the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We however, and those who are of our time, put on it ground cumin with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	What if the arrow does not obey you to enter into the eye on account of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose shape is this.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Make a perforation with it therefore the same conjunctiva, and do not put your hand in the opening: and it is not except that you make way to the arrow place subtle.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then insert the arrow, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, let there be prepared for the infirm a dormitory decently made, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark house: and let him be prohibited from all movements, and from coughing: and let his food be that which soothes his nature: and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be according to its disposition until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then undo it in that dark house, and try his vision: and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then put back the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary that he do that at the hour of cure, or immediately after the incision: but rather it is necessary to avoid that: because water ascends quickly through violent sight.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If however a hot aposteme occurs: then it is necessary that you loosen the eye before the seventh: and straighten it with what sits on the aposteme, until it is seated: then without its strength, and put over its face an oral bandage which regulates its vision under it for some days, while it exists in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let it go out of the house gradually, and let it turn to its own habits.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that the pupil is not excavated in the glassy body many times: for then it dares above the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed it has come to us a certain one of those who are from Alayrach, who said that a perforated sink was made in Alayrach, through which water is sucked.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that: nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are forms of species from a sink, so that it stands over them who are ignorant of them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from their own bronze: and let their extremities be with the same subtlety triangular, and the extremities pointed.
Formae magda.	Forms of a sink.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Of the treatment of flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes there are born in the nose various added flesh, among which is something that resembles a scorpion of many feet: and from it is a cancerous, stony, dark-colored flesh: and from it is what is a smooth, not dark-colored flesh.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In that therefore which is of these flesh smooth, not deceitful, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the weak one sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open its nostrils, and throw a hook into those flesh: then draw them to the outside, and cut what you have grasped of them with a subtle sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the whole flesh has now been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	What if something remains of it whose excision is not possible then scratch that with one of the subtle instruments with ease until nothing of it remains.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If however blood dominates you or there occurs a hot aposteme then apply to it what is necessary or it is one of the malignant apostemes then cauterize it quickly until the blood is cut off and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then let vinegar and water or wine be thrown into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If however the nose opens and moisture proceeds from it to the palate then know that it is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If indeed the moisture does not penetrate according to what is necessary then know that there is flesh born inside the upper bones of the nose to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then therefore it is necessary that you insert a thread of linen which has some thickness and knots on it many knots and put between each knot the quantity of a finger or less and let the weak one thrust so that he puts one end of the thread into the nose with the radius or as far as possible for him after which having made it similar to azar he draws his smelling thing until it reaches the caassus and comes out above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times indeed boys do something similar to this in schools and it is an easy thing for one who wants.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then put two ends of the thread, one end which comes out above the nose and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then take a minister to saw the flesh with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is already with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread and put into the nose after wiping away the blood a linen cloth which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put at the end of the thing a tin pipe into the nose, for some days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it needs a treatment that dries it out, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making a head purging, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or of brass: which should be similar to a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want make a closed pipe, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell-shaped instrument for making a head purging, should be full, perforated: which should have a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat in it oil, or whatever you want from juices and flowing things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the treatment of nasal polyp.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often a polyp grows at the end of the nose, and it increases and grows with time, until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that, it is necessary to cauterize it at the beginning of its appearance, and to eradicate all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put on the place, or a cauterization, or a medicine that burns which takes its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore the cutting of it is delayed, until it becomes large, then consider if it is stony, hard, of a dark color, of little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: because it is a cancerous aposteme.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen, that one who cuts a malignant tumor, and it happens from it great evil to the one who has it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the tumor is of a soft touch, not of a dark color, and you see that cutting is possible in its entirety, then evacuate the weak part, and cut it without fear, without anxiety: and treat the place with what dries and constricts, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	We should know when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, an operation is hardly performed on it, except in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore when anything happens to someone, that you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood, and then you should bring together the lips of the wound with a suture, afterwards cure it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of a solution of continuity are already separated and each part has become healthy, then it is necessary that you should cut away every part from its own skin until it becomes bloody.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture, and tie them, and powder over it dragon's blood and pounded olibanum: and put over the powders a piece of diafinicon plaster, or some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it tied for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then untie it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads separate of themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then cure it with an ointment, until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of the suture is, that you should bring together a solution of continuity, either with needles, as we have described in the suture of the belly: or bring together the solution with thread, as I have made you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of tumors of the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many men have lumps occurring inside their lips, hard excrescences similar to grains of herb, and some of them are small and others large.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary that you should turn back the lip, and find the node above it, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it on every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the space after the incision with zegi paste until the blood stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then let it be mixed with vinegar and the place where there is a styptic property be treated with it until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the incision of the flesh born above the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Frequently there is a birth of flesh above the gum which the ancients call abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It is necessary therefore that you suspend it with a hook, or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on the place zegi paste, or other styptic powders, which are astringent.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	For if that flesh returns after the treatment, for it often returns, then cut it a second time and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the scraping of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes there collect on the surfaces of teeth from the inner and outer part, and between the gums rough, foul, and sometimes blackened cortices, and become citrine and green, until corruption comes from that to the gum, and the teeth are made foul by it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It is necessary therefore that you make the weak person sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth, in which the cortices appear to you, and things similar to sand: until nothing remains of them, and do likewise with the blackness, and greenness, and yellowness, and other things until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore that which is in them from the beginning of scraping is removed, it is good: and if not, then repeat the scraping over them on one day, a second, and a third, until the utmost care is reached in what you use.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that the tooth needs scrapers of various forms and many shapes, according to which your operation is prepared: namely, because the scaper with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the scaper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of scrapers should be prepared by you, as you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you cure the tooth of its pain with all ingenuity, and delay in extracting it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not that the place of it is supplied when it is extracted: since it is a lofty substance: until when there is no excuse for extracting it, then it is necessary when it is weakened to extract it, so that it may be strengthened and certified by you, the aching tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often the weak pain deceives, and it seems that it is in a tooth and extracts it: then the pain does not cease, until the weak tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen that from the operation of bloodletting doctors.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the aching tooth is certified by you itself, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides: then move it with your fingers, or with subtle forceps at first gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in it with a good grip, and the head of the weak tooth between your knees: which you have already held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth according to straightness, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and introduce it under the tooth from all sides with ease, and check its movement, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the dense is perforated or corroded, then you should fill that opening with a cloth and tie it with a slender thread so that it does not break in the hour of your constriction on it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you act skillfully with scarification around the gum on all sides abundantly.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And preserve your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns on the weak part from that evil which is greater than its pain at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do what ignorant bleeders do in their haste and boldness to eradicate it, beyond what we have administered.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often cause great weaknesses to come upon men, which are difficult to break, and all of its roots remain, or some of them: or so that they extract it with certain bones of the jaw: as we have often testified to that.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then let it be cleansed after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	What if a flow of blood happens from the places (for it often happens), then take something of gum and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the gum does not work for you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shape of the slender forceps which move the dense thing at first, should be of long extremities, with a short arm, thick, so that they do not double when pressed on the tooth: they should be as you see of thick arms, until when you squeeze with them, they do not displace themselves, nor double: of short extremities, and they should be made from hardened iron or well-made steel, of straight extremities: and in their extremities there should be teeth, some of which enter into others, and squeeze with a decent constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the extremities are made in the shape of a parrot's beak which is called ciconia, and they are strong for constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of broken jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains after the eradication of a tooth that is broken, then it is necessary to put on the spot a plaster with butter for one or two days, until the spot softens: then insert into it a spit or forceps: whose extremities are similar to a bird's beak which is called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The shape of this is a pair of forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their extremities be made like a file for teeth, or like a tusk of ivory.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If then it does not come out for you with these forceps, then it is necessary that you cut above the root, and remove all the flesh, and insert an instrument which is called a small lever, whose shape is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let one extremity be short, a little thick: and let it not be hollow, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If then the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to use with these other instruments whose shapes are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first has a triangular extremity, in which there is a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	Shape of a triangular extremity that is subtle.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	And it is also used with this instrument having two branches, whose shape is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and iron tools which were previously mentioned in the scraping of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	And also let there be a using of this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of this shape, of triangular extremity twisted, in which there is a certain thickness, so that it does not break: and let it not be hollow.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that the instruments of teeth are many: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and the skilled artisan, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument, according to which he signifies the operation and the ailments themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Since there are some ailments for which the ancients did not mention an instrument, because of the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If the bone breaks from the jaw or from other bones of the mouth or becomes putrid: then probe over it in its own place with that which suits it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with gestures, the form of which is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be in it something of thickness gradually, so that it may be tightened, or the bone may be held with it, and it does not flee and is steady, until the bone goes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable for that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however there is a small amount of rot in the bone, then scrape it from its own rot, and cure it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the sawing of prominent teeth above the others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When the teeth are prominent not according to their natural course, a foul shape is made by it: and especially when it happens in women, and girls, namely those with veins.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and does not have its place, or it is possible to saw it, nor to file it: then extract it: and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, the form of which is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made from Indian iron, of sharp extremity, strongly.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cutting be that which you cut with for many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that another of the teeth is not disturbed.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however it is prominent and exposed to its own filing: then file it with a file made from Indian iron, the form of which is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be entirely made from Indian iron, and its handle be of a lesser thickness, strongly pointed, like a file with which they make needles: with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not disturbed and falls: then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain scrapers.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	What if it is dense, from which a part will be broken and injures the tongue: then it is necessary to smooth it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made even, and flattened, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt the speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Of the gold wire for filing the teeth.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth are subject to concussion and commotion from a blow or a fall: and the weak one cannot chew on what he eats so that it does not fall: and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment was of no use: then the idea for them is to be fastened with a gold wire: because silver becomes greenish and putrefies after days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be moderate in thinness and thickness according to the quantity that it can hold between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the shape of the filing indeed is, that you take the thread and insert double of it between two healthy teeth: then weave with both ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether one or several, until you reach with the web to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texture until the part from which you began: and pull your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not moved outwardly: and let your constriction with which you tighten the thread be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not protrude.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the overflowing ends of the thread with scissors: and gather both, and shape them with forceps: and hide them between a healthy tooth and a loose tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue: then let it be tightened thus while it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it becomes undone, or is cut, tighten them with another thread, and it will stay with that for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the shape of teeth, and the figure of the extraction of two healthy teeth, and of two movable teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it happens, that one tooth or two teeth return to their places after a fall, and are retained as we have described, and remain: and this is not done except by an artisan who is prudent and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And when something is fitted from the bones of the cheeks: and it is made from it in the form of a tooth, and it is put in the place, from which the tooth is strengthened and tightened, as we have said: and it remains, and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	On the cutting of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes the ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is, that you open the mouth of the weak person in your lap, and elevate their tongue: then cut that nervous ligament in width, until the tongue is freed from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	What if in it there is something of hardness and knotting, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then introduce an instrument into that, and cut it in width, until you cut the ligament, and the knotting is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, lest there be a fissure in the depth of the flesh, and you cut the artery there, and there occurs a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then let the area of the incision be colluted with rose water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a plaster made of flax, which the weak person holds during the whole night: so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If however there occurs a flow of blood, then put on the place a poultice of toasted barley.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a sluggish cauterization iron, which suits that purpose: afterwards cure it with the remaining cure, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Of the extraction of the Ranula that is made under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes there occurs under the tongue an apostema resembling a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function: and perhaps it is so enlarged, until it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation on it is, that you open the mouth of the infirm in front of the sun: and examine the apostema.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If you see it to be of a dark or black color, hard, which the infirm person does not feel: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it leans to whiteness, where there is humidity, then cast a hook into it, and cut it with a subtle spatula, and free it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	What if the blood overcomes you during the time of your operation, then put above it pounded zegi, until the blood is stopped: afterwards return to your operation, until you extract it with its completeness.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let it be glued with vinegar and salt: and cure it with the remaining cure suitable for that, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Of the cure of the apostema of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur in the throat glands, that is, glandules, which resemble almonds, which occur in the form of nuts: and are named the two Amygdala: which when you cure with what we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If it is a hard apostema, of dark color, of little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it also with iron, fearing the flow of blood, but rather leave it, until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then you will either perforate it or it will rupture by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is subtle: then it should be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is, that you consider before its operation, if its aposteme has cooled quiet completion, or is diminished by some diminution: then make the weak sit in front of the sun, and its head be in your bosom: and open its mouth, and let the servant receive between his hands, and press its tongue downwards with an instrument, of this form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made from silver, or copper, which is subtle like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you press its tongue with it, and the aposteme is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the amygdala, and extract it to the outside as much as you can, except that you pull with it something of the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, of which the shape is as follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is similar to forceps: nevertheless its extremities are curved, so that the orifice of each of them is directed towards the tip of the other: whence take care that it be made from iron, or steel that has been tempered.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not available, then cut it with a spatulum, of which the shape is as follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let one side be sharp, and the other side not sharp.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one amygdala, cut the other according to the same pattern of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the cutting, let the weak person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if a flow of blood happens to him, let him gargle with water in which the bark of pomegranates have been boiled: or leaves of myrtle, and similar things among astringents, until the flow of blood is stopped: then take care of it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when abscesses appear in the throat besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Cut it therefore equally on both sides as I said in the incision of the two tonsils.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I indeed have already treated a woman for an abscess that had developed in her throat, which was pulling towards the trachea, with little sensation, which had nearly closed her throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had already prohibited her from eating, and drinking water: and she would have reached death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches, until they came out above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I forced it therefore hastily, and I fixed one of them with a hook.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large portion was pulled out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off, where it was grasped coming from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did to it what proceeded from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess: then I cut off from it a part of it, and there did not flow from it except a little blood: therefore the throat of the woman was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I did not therefore cease to cut into that abscess many times for a long time: and the abscess followed in the place of what I was cutting, until it was prolonged too much and with that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I cauterized therefore, and I burned the abscess in the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood therefore from increasing: then I walked away from the area, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Of the incision of the abscess of the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the cold descends to the ulcers and becomes inflamed and is long: then it itself is called perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it itself is called a UAV or haw, however,  more properly translated as "ulcer" as uva.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not work: and you see that the hot aposteme has quieted from it, and is subtle: then it is necessary to cut it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which is gathered from it round, and is not long, and is bloody, or of a dark reddish color, or black, and has no sensation: then it is necessary to avoid cutting it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in it there is fear for the weak.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is necessary therefore when you see it according to the measure which I spoke of from its whiteness and its length, that you make the weak one sit before the sun: and press his tongue with an instrument, whose description was given before: then tie a hook in the mouth, and pull it downwards: and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from it except that which exceeds the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you will injure the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the cutting use that which we described in the cutting of the two tonsils: and treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however the weak one trembles at the cutting: then it is necessary that you use ingenuity in the cauterization of it without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization on it is not, except with sharp water: and it is, that you put the head of the weak one on your shoulder.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I mentioned to you in the chapter on cauterization, and mix with it quicklime, and put it not too thick, nor too subtle, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, whose form is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremities of it in which the medicine is put be hollow, such as the hollow of a spoon or a radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And put the instrument with medicine on the wound itself: and let the weak person be lying on his side, so that saliva runs out of his mouth from the inner medicine, so that nothing descends from it to his throat, and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you apply it to the wound for the space of half an hour, until you see that it is already blackened and the biting of the medicine has settled.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you want to take a piece of cloth, and wrap it around the extremity of the radius, and dip the cloth with medicine, and insert the radius with the cloth into the tube from above, until the cloth adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you achieve what you want concerning the cauterization of the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it alone: for it will dry and fall off after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	What if you judge that you should repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization cleanse around the wound with cloth soaked in butter, and clean what is around it from medicine: and wash with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And let it be treated externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This therefore is the most wholesome method of treatment, surpassing incision and remote from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes wounds are also treated with what is more subtle than cauterization and incision: for they are treated with fumigation, in this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamine, and hyssop, and origan, and rue, and sseah, and chamomile, and abrotan, and similar things from herbs: and gather all of them, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil: and the pot should be coated with plaster; and let there be an opening in the middle of the pot, upon which the instrument called concave is placed in this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made from silver or brass: and the extremity should be inserted, in which there is a grain, into the mouth of the infirm, until the vapor ascends to the palate above the tube, until the palate becomes very obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then rub over it many times, until it is scraped away.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, that you do not make this cure at the beginning of an apostema.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For a plaster adds to an apostema: and it is not proper to make that unless at the decline of the apostema when it has become cool.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If however this instrument is not present to you, then take a cane, and place the bark of an oak at its extremity: so that the mouth of the infirm does not burn: for the bark of the oak prohibits vapor from burning the mouth: and this is from good cure with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the extraction of spines, and bones from the jaw.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone or a fish spine, or something else sticks to the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	It is necessary therefore to extract that which of them appears visible upon which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument at the base, and it becomes clear to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And that which does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the infirm vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the thing attached will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Let the weak person swallow a piece of nap, or a root of lettuce, or let him swallow a morsel of dry bread: or let him take a piece of dried marine sponge: and tie it in a thread, then let him swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When it reaches the place where there are spines, or bones, and is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not come out with what we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a Rod for a little while, and at its end let there be a curvature, which it may introduce into the throat with ease: and let it have its head elevated upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let it beware of the touch of its epiglottis, so that coughing does not befall it, and let it push the mouth, or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But that which the weak person introduces, is better: on account of its knowledge of the place of the thing annexed: and it pushes below, or draws his hand upwards with the instrument, all that according to the quantity that is prepared for it, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Of the extraction of bloodsuckers.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a bloodsucker is treated with what I have said in the division on curation with medicines, and it does not come out, then examine in the throat of the weak person before the sun, or at the window after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument that I described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your sight then falls upon the bloodsucker, extract it with a small hook, or with gentle gestures.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with these: then take a concave tube, and introduce it into the throat of the weak person until near the throat: then introduce into the concavity of the tube ignited iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Let him do that many times: and let the weak man abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him receive a full drink of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him gargle his mouth with it, and not swallow anything of it: and let him move the water with one hand after another.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For a leech sticks to the skin when it feels the water falling.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	And if it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the weak person with cumin seeds, or with asphalt with an instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the ulcer.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Let him do that many times, for it will fall out by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which there are burning prunes or laurel with fire: and the pot is covered with a cover, in the middle of which there is a hole: and let the end of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw in the fumigation, and let the weak person put his mouth on the end of the tube, and let him close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not come out, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall out.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	For if it does not fall out, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the weak person endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is necessary therefore that it comes out with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the shape of the instrument with which a leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls on the same thing seen.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is introduced into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to a bird's beak, which is called ciconia, in which there is roughness of lime: when it seizes something, it does not release it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of abscesses, and their cutting, and treatment in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of many modes, according to which the treatment of them is remembered, namely one and only one in this book: and they are diverse in the perforation of them, and the cutting of them from two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is from the species of abscess by itself, and that which it includes from humors.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is on account of the places, in which it occurs in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an abscess that occurs on the head is different from an abscess occurring on the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of abscesses there are some which should not be perforated, unless after the maturation of pus in them and its completion: and of them there are some which should be perforated while they are raw and do not mature according to completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like abscesses that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when an abscess occurs near a joint and its existence is prolonged until it putrefies what is in its surroundings, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: which is a cause closer to the contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a principal member: for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either it or through that principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it while it is immature: and it is not proper to perforate a raw abscess, of incomplete digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its end what does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time of the perforation of the abscess, which has matured according to its completion: and it is at the sedation of pain, the recession of fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and the acuteness of the head of the abscess: and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lowest place of the abscess, and of the most prominent elevation: and let the perforation be going in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and the places of the arms, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places, to which there is not a reflexion.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those however which reflect, let it go with the perforation according to that membrane.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When indeed the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better that you omit the perforation of it, until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to its completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you perforate it before that, the course of the pus is prolonged from it, and there is much filth and foulness, and perhaps the lips of it will become calloused, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body, by necessity: or according to that which the membrane needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer to small abscesses a small perforation, and to large abscesses a large perforation: or many sections by similarity of the magnitude of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses, in which it is necessary that the skin be concave: and an incision be made when already it has been made like a cloth, and it has been made to its limit, which already is dead: as that which happens in many, such as buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And of them there are those which cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from them is that which is cut like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an abscess in the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from them are those for which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are administered, and similar ones from the incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That one indeed which has no head, as are the lenient superficial abscesses, should be perforated with a superficial perforation, or merely a flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the abscess is thick, and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, that you not hurry and extract all the pus at that hour: but rather extract a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then dress the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do that many times according to the condition, until it goes out: especially if the person is weak and lacking in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or a decrepit old man: for the vital spirit of an animal is often resolved with the discharge of pus: and perhaps the weak person dies, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Beware therefore this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, by which you perforate the abscesses, it is necessary that you clean the wound: and take care.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then administer dressings made from linen, or old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and there are many openings of the incision, then it is necessary that you insert a dressing into every opening, until they meet in the middle.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut away a part of the skin in the abscess, or have hollowed it out around the edges: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when a fabric is woven, or wool from linen without moisture: and tie it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then anoint it, and treat it with what is suitable from the ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after which the cloth is soaked in them: and you put it on the place of the flow of blood many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If however the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary that you administer a treatment and a cure and powders, which I have described in many places in this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If however it is in the time of winter, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you pour in powders with wine, and hot oil: and you put them on the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you put powders soaked in water, and oil, or wine and oil, and all of that is cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you loosen the abscess, and wipe it clean, and administer in its cure what is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the cure of abscesses in general.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess, in what way it is a route to its cure, chapter by chapter, individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Of the section on abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	There occur on the skin of the head small abscesses, and they are of the species of Knots, which are contained in sacs, which are attached to them: as if they themselves were the gizzard's husks.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many species of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some of them are fatty: and some of them contain a moisture similar to slime: and some of them contain a moisture similar to that of roasted and boiled things: and similar things, and some of them are hard and stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the cutting of all, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as the arterial cut does not cause a contradiction.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in the cutting of them is, that you should try it with an instrument, whose form will be described after this, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains moisture, then dry it by a cut according to the length of the superficial cut: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the cut from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated, then scratch out the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not leave any of it inside.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it returns many times, if something of it remains.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then submerge the wound in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it corrodes what remains of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over the wound with the Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you apply it to it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, then treat the wound with an ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	Which if the abscess contains a fatty knot: then cut it according to this form, having the shape of a cross: and put unguents between the lips of the cut, and scratch it out from every side: and test your skill in the extraction of the tunic which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If however the artery causes a complication for you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do similarly in the case of a stone, from cutting and curing, the same as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the cutting above a stone abscess is easier: since there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And there are sometimes certain apostemata which are on the head in which there is not humidity within.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is: because I cut into an apostema on the head of an old woman, and I found the apostema like a hard and solid stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if someone were to strike it by throwing, it would wound.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other accidental apostemata on the head, besides these, namely the apostemata which occur on the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the section of all of them should be a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation in them always from the lower part, so that the flow of blood may be alleviated downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat them with what is suitable for them from the treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the cutting of Strangulations in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These apostemata often occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur on the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And above those that occur on the neck, there are one or many: and they generate from a cause: and every Strangulation of them is within its own proper tunic, as it is in knots and apostemata of the head, as we have described.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these Strangulations.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And of them some are stony: and of them some contain humidities: and of them some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, in that one which you see of them with a good disposition to the touch, whose manifest appearance is near to the color of the skin, and moves to every part, and is not attached with the nerves of the neck, nor with the gullet, nor with the artery, nor is it deep: it is necessary that you cut it with a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body in a line, and remove it from every part: and stretch the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if it is necessary for it, as we have said in the case of apostemata of the head, and extract it little by little.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is above the caution, that the vein or nerve is not cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the spatula be not sharp, lest you add your hand with the incision, or disturb the weak part, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you cut the vein, or artery, it prohibits you from operation, then put on the wound a poultice of zeolite, or some powders that staunch blood, and constrict the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the inflammation subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is staunched by a tunic of flesh, therefore return to your operation, until you complete.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then probe with your index finger, if any of the small fragments of the strophules remain: therefore cut them, and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	What if there is in the root of the strophule a large vein: then it is necessary that you do not cut that strophule from its root: but rather it is necessary that you tie it with a double strong thread, and let it go until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cotton, which you have already steeped in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole strophule is cut, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and sew them up at once, after you see that nothing remains superfluous.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that something remains superfluous on account of the size of the strophule, then it is necessary that you proceed to cut its root, and extract it: and administer the suture which we mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And which of the strophules contains humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation: that the place of its maturation may appear to you: and put the perforation from that which follows below the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then administer a dressing with ointment after the perforation, and similar things to it, so that it corrodes what remains from the corruption, until when you see the wound is already clean: then treat it with a generating ointment of flesh, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Of the cutting of the epiglottis from an abscess that happens inside the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said this incision on the epiglottis, and I did not see anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In those having a synanche, it is necessary that the incision of the epiglottis be made: since there is no passage through it: because all the veins and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those indeed who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, it is necessary to use the incision of the epiglottis, to flee from the destruction which is made by the suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	It is necessary therefore when the need arises, that we cut the epiglottis under three circles of the epiglottis, or four, a small incision in width, in that which is between two circles in quantity, so that it is an incision in the sifac, not in the cartilage: and this place indeed is suitable for the incision, because it is deprived of flesh, and the vessels of blood are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	What if the doctor is timid, then it is necessary that he stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then let him pierce the skin, until when he reaches the canal: let him divert the vessels of blood, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then let him cut the sifac which we have mentioned: and it is indicated above the incision of the canal from the phlegm that exits from it, with what disrupts it, and from the cutting off of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the open wound for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When the hour arrives in which the suppuration is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and suture it by itself without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that make flesh grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this sermon which we have narrated is not an exposition, except when they see that one of these apostemata has already strangled the throat of the infirm, and the infirm has been lifted up from death, and his breaths are about to be cut off: they proceed to cut the Epiglottis, so that the infirm may breathe over the place of the wound with a certain respiration, and may be saved from death: and for this reason they have ordered to leave the wound open, until the malignity of the disease is consumed, and its malignity is for three days, and as it were; then therefore they have ordered to suture the wound, and to cure it, until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I have seen by myself is, that a certain servant girl took a knife, and thrust it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the canal of the lung.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to the cure of it, and I found her vomiting, as is the vomiting of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I probed therefore at the wound, and I found blood which had come out from the wound a little.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was confounded therefore that she had not cut the vein, nor the windpipe: and air came out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I treated therefore the wound, and I cured it, until it was healed: and nothing happened to the servant girl, except hoarseness of voice: and she returned after days to her better dispositions.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that in the cutting of the Epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the surgical cutting of the throat hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This condition called Hernia of the throat is a large abscess, secondary to the color of the body, and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is secondary to two modes: for it is either natural or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one certainly there is no trickery.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one, indeed, is secondary to two modes: of which one is similar to fatty knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to an abscess that occurs from a knotting of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is fear, and it is not suitable that a presumptuous action be taken on it with iron, unless it is small: and you will test it, and investigate it with an introducer.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty knot, and it is not suspended with any of the veins: then cut it, as knots are cut: and extract it with what it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then thoroughly examine all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the place with what is suitable for the cure, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On the cutting of the species of Knots.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many species of knots, and I have already mentioned all their species in the division: and it is necessary that I explain here the difference between a Knot and an Excrescence: since it causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that when there is an Excrescence, there is heat, and fever, and violent pains, until the ebullition of the overflowing is settled, and putrefaction is complete: then indeed the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	With a Knot, however, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains them in cysts of the flesh, which is their proper sac, and it is secondary to the color of the body: and its inception is like a seed, and it forms like a lump, and is greater and lesser.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are divided into two types: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary therefore, when you come to the cure of a Knot, that you examine it, and inquire into it first with an instrument which is called Intromissum, according to which its form will appear in the chapter which is after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiring into abscesses and all Knots is that you take this instrument and insert it into the moist place which you find in the abscess, and you move your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then put your hand last according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then extract the Intromissum, and consider that which comes out in its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore a running moisture comes out, of whatever color it may be: then dry it with a superficial incision, according to what I said concerning other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not come out in the track of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty: dry therefore above it with an incision having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and scratch the skin from every part with ease: and guard the cyst if you can above it, so that you extract it healthy with the Knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If the cyst however is ruptured during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it fragment by fragment, until nothing of it remains.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little or much of it remains, the Knot returns according to the greatest part.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it conquers you, and a little of it remains: then fill the wound at the completion with certain corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and put on top of it what sits on the abscess, a warm application, and cure it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then it is a large knot, then sew its two lips, and cure it with what flesh grows.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however the contrary vein is pulsating or not pulsating: then treat it, and fill the place of the zegi with trito, and leave it tightened for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies, and the ebullition of blood quiets down: then return to cutting that which remains of the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Of the forms of instruments for cutting and boring.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are forms of the introdgers, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For there is one large, and there is one medium, and there is one small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made from iron of Al-fuld quadratus of the extremities decent, so that they hold fast the entrance in the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of the EXPERIENCIA, and that is to say, the perforators: and one of them is named Beris, that is, the perforator: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For there is one large, and one medium, and one small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They convene, that they investigate through them the abscesses, and the exit wounds, and the fistulas, and the bubos from what is between them of bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and blunt, like large needles with which sutures are sewn, namely of citrin, or of copper, or of iron, or of silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better ones of them are those which are made from citrin.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And the EXPERIENCIA are also made from black lead, which convene that they experiment with fistulas, whose concavities are reflections, so that they reflect with gentleness with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For there are some of them long, some of them medium, and some of them short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and the tightness of it.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of wounds, and they are of many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Since some of them are simple, namely those which have one treatment, and they are of three species, as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And some of them are blind wounds, and they are of three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And some of them are wounds having two treatments, and they are of three species: and some of them are wounds having three treatments, and they are of three species: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the shapes of surgical knives, with which they cut and excavate knots and abscesses: and they are of three species: since some of them are large, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which the cutting is done are sharp, the other extremities are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, except so that with them a juncture is made in the excavation of knots near the fear of cutting a vein, or nerve: and so that it may be healed through this, and find tranquility for a time from the burning which it found near the excavation of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are forceps, and they are of three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of brass, and are similar to a file, with which is made a fine powder: and on the broad extremity there is a hidden point of a spatula: and it goes inside and outside when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of spatulas which are hidden between the fingers near the perforation of abscesses: and the weak do not perceive them: and they are of three species, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The shapes of cauteries with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three species, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of brass or copper, round, a little long, as you see: and let them be subtle.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these species of bleedings are great and small with you, so that you cut blood with them quickly when necessary, and then when medicine is not present with you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you will not use them for cutting blood in every part of the body, and you will not use them except in fleshy places: such as the thighs, and hips, and arms, and breasts, and belly, and groin, and similar fleshy and moist ones.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes small instruments similar to the skins of whips are made from them, according to their shape: with which blood is cut when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the cutting of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the treatment of men's breasts which resemble women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men become inflated during a fullness of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they resemble women's breasts: and they remain as foul apostemas.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	He who therefore abhors this, should cut above the breasts a lunar section, according to this shape from line b to line g. Then scrape out all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill the wound with an incarnative medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and cure it, until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the breast declines to the lower parts and becomes soft because of its size, as it happens with women: then it is necessary that two sections similar in shape to a crescent moon be made on its upper sides, each of which is connected to the other at their edges, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this shape from line b to line g. Afterwards scrape off the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If you do not close the incision of what you need to cut, because of the unease of the weak or because of the flow of blood: then you should fill the wound with a submersed corrosive ointment, and leave it, until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then cure it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the perforation of an aposteme, which occurs under the tongue.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These apostemes which occur under the tongue, are of the hard species of Strophulons, which contain cysts, and of them are those which contain humors.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Which therefore are of those which contain humors, it is necessary that they be cut with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b. to line g., when therefore all that is in the aposteme is evacuated of blood, then fill it with old oil, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let the plaster be removed, and let it be cured with an ointment suitable for that, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	Which if the aposteme was of the species of nodes of Strophulons, then cut above it, as we have said in the section on Strophulons equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If however the wound extends in this so that it emits pus, then administer to it a cautery, according to what we have said in what has been previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the cutting of an aposteme which occurs because of the artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is torn and the skin which is above it becomes consolidated, then often an aposteme occurs from it: and similarly it happens to the veins also, so that an aposteme and inflammation occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that an aposteme and inflammation are because of the artery and vein, are: since when the aposteme is because of the artery, it is long, collected in the depth of the body: and when you press the aposteme with your fingers, you feel as if there were a hissing.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is on account of the Vein, is round in the manifest body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And cutting above this swelling is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and the groin, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is a great fault.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	It is necessary therefore that its treatment be undertaken with iron, and what of them is also in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary that it be undertaken.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Above that therefore which of them is from the inflation of the opening of the artery, a cut is made in the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the cut with forceps, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert beneath it a needle, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread at two places, according to that which I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place, which is between the two ligaments with a spatula, until all the blood that is in it comes out, and the swelling is relieved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a treatment that generates pus, until the ligaments fall away: afterwards treat it with ointments suitable to it, until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	What if the swelling is on account of a cut of the vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what you can from the swelling with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be double thread in it, until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the swelling with a good ligature: according to what I said to you concerning the ligature of the vein, from two parts with two extremities of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you fear that the thread will be extracted, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole swelling at the point of the incision of the needle: press, and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the aposteme in its middle, until when what is in it comes out: then cut the excess of the skin, and release what was tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on it a poultice which you have submerged in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure, which is done with plasters and ointments, until it is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning the aposteme that occurs from a twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an aposteme occurs in the artery and vein, similarly an aposteme occurs in the nerves: which occurs from a blow, or occurs from excessive labor, and similar things: and it happens most to those in the places of joints, or heel, and in every place where the joints move: and it is a grave aposteme.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color resembles the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is constricted with inflammation, one feels in it a weakness similar to numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an aposteme collected in the depth of the body, but rather it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not proceed to the front, nor forward, nor backward to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	What therefore is in the joints, ought not to be entered with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps a contraction will occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that which of them is on the head, or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is a small aposteme, then take hold of it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then hang it with a hook, and scratch it: then remove it, and close the wound with a suture: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the cutting of an aposteme that occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Pains occur to certain men many times in their bellies and in the rest of their bodies, which are called Fungal infections, because of their similarity with mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Of which the root is subtle, and their head is thick, and their lips are inverted.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there is one of them that is small: and there is one of them that is greatly swollen.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I have seen a man, and in his belly were two fungal infections, which were more similar to mushrooms than the others: there was no difference between them, they were white, with small roots, and their lips were inverted, and ended, and moisture flowed from them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I cut them out, and I found one of them weighed about 8 ounces and the other about 6 ounces. And the operation for cutting them out is that you should consider then, if the patient is weak and the color of the fungal infection is white, moist, with a subtle root: then cut it out with a broad spatula, and have your cauterizing irons ready at hand.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For much blood is often expelled in the cutting of it: therefore if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the patient is weak, pale and timid of the cutting with iron, then take a thread made from lead and tie it around the suture: whose method is what we have described, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then put on the suture a lead dressing.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not therefore cease to bind with lead, as many times as it impresses on the fungal infection, until it is cut off and falls away by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If the fungal infection is thick of root, then in the cutting of it there is something to be feared and dreaded: especially if it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	It is possible to cut through the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it, until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware that you do not cut into the black bile which is of a dark color, of little sensation, and foul appearance: for it is a cancerous aposteme: and I call it with remembrance of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of the prominence of the navel.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The prominence of the navel occurs from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from a tear of the diaphragm, which is above the belly: and there comes out of it either gut or intestine, according to which there occurs in the remainder a rupture.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been previously stated.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from flatulence confined within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however it is on account of a tear of the diaphragm, and an issue of the gut: then the color of the tumor is similar to the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and appears in different places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is on account of a protrusion of the intestine, then its location is with that which we have narrated, of more vehement diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a gurgling sound: and it is greatly increased at the entrance of the bath, and vehement labor.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If indeed it is on account of humidity, it is soft, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor is it added to.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	For if it is on account of blood, then with these signs the tumor appears as a blackness on the navel.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however it is on account of flesh that has grown: then the tumor is serious, thick, hard, and fixed according to a single quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If the wound is on account of obesity, then the touch of it is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is, that you should consider then, if the prominence of the navel is due to blood of the Artery, or Vein, or obesity: then it is necessary that you should abstain from the cure of it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and dread in it, as I have taught you in the chapter, in which I said that apostems are due to the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	What if the prominence of the navel is due to the intestine, or a cyst: then it is necessary that you should instruct the weak person, so that he may hold his breath, and stand standing upright.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with a cauterizing agent around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards instruct him to breathe again between your hands over his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then apply a plaster with a broad spatula around the navel above the place which you marked with the cauterizing agent.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards extend the middle of the apostema upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it around the strong part with a thread, or with a cord of silk of firm binding: and let the knot of the binding be secure.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the extended apostema above the binding.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find that it is already caught by the binding: then pull out the secure one, and insert the index finger into it, and push the intestine to the interior of the belly: and if you find a cyst, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If on the other hand the artery or vein is opposite to you: then apply a bandage around it plentifully.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert the two needles around the area which you made around the apostema in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the aposteme in four places above the needle, and if it is necessary, remove the needle, and leave the place until the flesh putrefies and extends and falls off by itself, or cut it when it becomes subtle and putrefies.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary from ointments, until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	What if there is an elevation of the navel from the flesh or from humidity, then it is necessary to concave the aposteme, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or humidity, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with what solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	On the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of cancer, and how it is the way to cure it with medicines: and to be cautious with the treatment of it with iron, so that it does not become ulcerated: and we have spoken of cancer generated in the matrix, and the caution in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that whenever cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as cancer which is in the breasts, or in the hip, and similar members located for extraction of all of it: especially when it is beginning and small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When, however, it becomes old and is large, it is not necessary to approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I was not able to heal anyone from it, nor have I seen another before me who has approached that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is to proceed and dissolve the weak part with black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then perform bloodletting on it if you find it with a clear fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the weak part with a preparation, in which it will be located with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw onto the cancer acidic juices that agree with it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterward, cut it away from every part with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing of its roots remains: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, but express the place, and wipe away all the gross blood with your hand, or with whatever instrument is possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however the flow of gross blood causes a contradiction to you from the incision of an artery, or a vein: then cauterize the vein, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	On the treatment of Dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 44.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have now described in the division of the species of Dropsy, and how the collection of water is made: and the signs of each species, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron, is not but the species of ascites alone: and it does not come near to the species of tympanites with iron: nor to the species of hyposarca deeply: for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of Dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your medication has not been effective: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if weakness has already befallen the patient, or there is with it another infirmity besides Dropsy: such as if there is with it a cough, or a loosening of the stomach, and things similar to these: then beware lest you treat him with iron: for that is to be feared.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If however you see the weak one of overflowing strength, and there is not with it a disease besides Dropsy alone: and it is neither a child, nor an old man: then the method of operation on it is, that you lift the weak one standing between your hands, and a servant behind him expresses his stomach with his hand pushing water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spiney splint, second to this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It is a sharp instrument of two parts, long, at the acute extremity like a Spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	It has in it something of shortness gradually, so that you do not pass through with it during the operation to the intestine, and wound it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a generation of dropsy from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you should extend with the incision from the navel the quantity of three fingers, downwards directly above the breast.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the generation of dropsy is because of sickness of the liver, then let your incision be to the left from the navel three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is not necessary also that the incision be on the side above which the weak person wishes to lie, so that the superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with an instrument the whole skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and scrape, as if you were excavating it: and let the quantity which is excavated be the quantity of a nail, or around it.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then scrape pierce, until the spatula reaches the empty place: and it is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and introduce into the opening an instrument, whose form is this.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: made from silver, or copper, or gold, smooth: which has in its lower part a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side: and the end of it is cut, according to the mode of cutting of a reed, as you see: on its upper end is an armilla.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument penetrates the water, then it itself descends immediately on top of the instrument, and thus evacuates from the water half the quantity in an hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate from it more than is proper, the weak perhaps dies in an hour through the resolution of its vital spirit, or a fainting fit that approaches death befalls him.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the disposition of the weak signifies to you from the virtue of his pulse, and from his goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	Which is, because it is retained immediately on account of the skin which retains the opening that is above the navel: concerning which I have spoken, that you should perforate it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then insert the instrument on the second day, if you see the weak person tolerate it: and withdraw also from the water a small quantity.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that for some days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there does not remain from the water except a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If however you fear for the weak person, and you let remain from the water a large amount: then treat it with wrapping in hot sand, and with much sweating in a bath and sun, and waiting upon thirst: and treat it with evacuating medicines, until it is healed: and cauterize on the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the evacuation of the water: according to what I have narrated in what has preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the treatment of infants who are born with their urine places not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter 45.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any infant proceeds from the womb of its mother, and the head of its bladder is not perforated, or the opening is constricted, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is necessary therefore to help with the perforation of it at once when it is born with a sharp needle, according to this method.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put in the opening a subtle key made of lead, and tie it; and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When the bladder is raised to emit urine, it should be removed, and micturated.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put in the lead, it is possible that the urine which enters over the place will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He, indeed, whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those, however, in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	Which is, that in those who are born with it, the opening is at the end of the head of the penis: wherefore they cannot urinate to the front, unless they lift the penis with their hand to the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is not for them generation, because the sperm cannot reach the womb according to the right direction: and it is a foul and loathsome disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of treatment for this is that the weak one should lie on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then stretch out the head of his penis with your left hand with vigorous extension, and cut the head of the head of the penis from its place at the foreskin with a sharp needle, or a sharp scalpel: just as is the cutting of a reed, or just as you would pare something, so that the middle of it comes to resemble the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle according to what is fitting.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware for yourself during the operation of a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For that thing has happened many times.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Apply to it therefore something that stops the blood, and cure the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Of Albucasis concerning what happens to the foreskin and head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 6.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These often occur to that Albather on a branch, and it is a prominence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And some of them are malignant, and some are not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	You should therefore hang the non-malignant one with a fine hook, and cut it off, until you cleanse it completely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put on it a plaster submerged in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it afterwards with the diaphatic ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	Which if the Albather is malignant, of foul color, then you should administer to it a cautery after its incision and shaving.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If the Albather is on the foreskin of one who is not circumcised, and part of the Albather is under the foreskin, and part of it outside: then you should remove the Albather that is inside first, until when it has consolidated, then treat the outside one: for when you treat them both at the same time, the foreskin does not heal unless it is perforated.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And they also occur on the testicles, and a blackening and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	You should therefore cauterize all that has already turned black, and what is about to decay, or has already decayed.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply on it after that a honey which has already been mixed with flour of roasted grains and crushed herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If there occurs a flow of blood, then administer a cautery with lunar cautery, according to this method.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cautery is useful for two conditions at the same time, namely for a flow of blood, and for an ulcer when it becomes decayed.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	Which if the head of the branch is eaten away, and it is destroyed entirely in an hour: then you should insert into the mouth of the penis a tube made of lead, so that the weak man urinates over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion of the skin of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy and does not require being cut around it; and when adhesion happens because of a wound or an abscess, it is necessary to cauterize it with a blunt cautery until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	What if it is difficult to discern these things exactly, then it is necessary to cauterize something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	What is, that the foreskin, when it is delicate, is perhaps perforated quickly because of its delicacy.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then let it be treated with astringent wine until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the purification of infants, and the treatment of errors that occur to them by chance.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds: nevertheless since it is from our operation, our will, and its use is properly in children, it is necessary that we indicate in it the better operation, and the lighter way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, since they do not use it in their laws, and it is not except what we have acquired through experimentation.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	What is, that I have found the greater part of artisans and bloodletters using purification by circumcision with a razor, and with scissors: and they use poultices, and ligatures with thread, and incisions with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I have already tried all these methods, and I did not find a better purification than with scissors, and ligature with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Since in cleansing with a razor, the skin often slips away.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower layer remains: hence it is forced to a cutting in order to cut the other, and future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the cleansing that is done by means of a digital dilator, which surgeons use, the cutting of the extremity of the member is not secured: because perhaps it will enter into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron will slip and spoil your operation: and indeed the skin of a child is brief by nature, and often such things are born, which do not require cleansing: and I have already seen it.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	Cleansing with forceps and ligation with a thread has shown me a good test: because the forceps are proportional to the incision: therefore, since the sharpness that is above is as the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When I press with my hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation at one time: and a compression of similar figure is made, containing the skin of the member from all parts, with which error does not fall at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of its operation is that you should cause to extenuate, especially a child, if it is one of those who understand for a little while, what you do not do, except that you tie a thread on its member only: and leave it until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make it rejoice and be happy in every way that is possible for you, from the fact that it receives its intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make it stand between your prepared hands, and let it not be sitting: and hide the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the child does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into her vagina, and blow into the wound, and pull it upwards, until the head of the vagina comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from the filth that has accumulated in its dirtiness.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards tie below it for a short space a second ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger, and thumb the place of the lower ligature with good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the wound upwards quickly, and extract the head of the vagina.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow out gradually (for it is better) and put powder on top: and over the powder a cloth in which the yolk of an egg has been spread, mixed with oil of fresh rose, and let it stay on until the next day: and treat it with the remainder of the treatment, until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of a fork is for this cleansing.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two extremities be blunt, and let them be cutting: so that a branch of a nail does not come out in them: and let the length of the two sharp edges be equal to the length of the two armlets.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The error falling in the cleansing is: that perhaps the whole inner skin escapes, or a part of it at the place of the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary that you stretch it out with your nail before the postulation of the place: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	What if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If however three days have passed and what is under the vagina remains inflated, a postulate: then let it be, until a warm postulate settles, and remove it with ease, and cut it according to what is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the vagina.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Treatment is thus with what consolidates the wound from powders, which we described in the treatment of powders: and if it cuts into the skin above the measure, and proceeds to the upper parts, it will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Treatment is thus with that which we mentioned, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of retained urine from the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction made from stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh that has grown, and similar things to these which we mentioned as methods of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine does not flow, and you see that its retention is on account of a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that he should be made to sit bending over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet should be placed on his back, and he should stretch out his belly from the upper part of his back, and the man should constrict his breath as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	It is thus pressed with the neck of the bladder to expel the stone backwards, wherefore the urine will flow.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	What if it is not solved with what we mentioned, and the thing is severe for the man: then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: It should be of silver, and should be subtle, thin, concave like the quill of a feather in subtlety of a radius, long in likeness of one and a half palms: to which there should be a thin tube at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of exit of urine through it is, that you take a double thread, and tie at its end a wool or a string, with a good knot: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with the forceps if something overflows from the wool, truly introduce into the tube with vehemence, like alzer.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg: and make the weak sit upon a seat, and embrocate the vessel, and its own virge with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the virge with ease, until it reaches to the root of the virge.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then fold it over double from the upper part near the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe into it, until it reaches to the bladder, and let the weak feel that it has already reached to the empty space: and this is not done according to this order, unless the passage, in which it goes, is where there is a tortuosity.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with a woolen yarn little by little.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the vein will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it, and make the vein run through the way of urine: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do that, until the bladder is evacuated, and the weak feels relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of evacuating the bladder with a Clyster.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When there happens to be an ulcer in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is confined in it, and one wishes to distill waters and medicines into it: then let it be done with an instrument which is called a Clyster, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is closed, that is, shut.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two from one side and one from the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which is that which pushes, should be according to the quantity that fills it without addition, until when something is pulled with it, it attracts from humidities: and when it is pushed, it expels far off: according to which the clyster does, which projects naphtha, that is, Greek fire in the mart's bellows.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When I insert the instrument to project moistures into the bladder, I introduce the extremity of the catheter into the moisture, and pull with it what pushes upwards, for moisture is pulled into the concavity of the catheter.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then I introduce its extremity into the vein, according to what we have narrated concerning the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then I push moisture with that which pushes it, for moisture immediately penetrates to the bladder, so that the weak person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The shape of a thin enema instrument by which the bladder is enemad.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made from silver or gold: whose head is higher, similar to a small spoon, and under that a sinus in which the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a goat, and put in it moisture, with which you will enema the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two sinuses with a strong ligature and double thread: and heat that moisture a little over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the extremity of the enema instrument into the vein, afterwards press your hand over the bladder with moisture with a suitable pressure, until the weak person feels that the moisture has already penetrated to the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If however the bladder is not present for you, then take a piece of parchment, and make from it a circle, and perforate it throughout its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread into those holes, as they are turned.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as the sponge is gathered: after which you put in it that which you use from moistures, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it in the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder from expression with your hand, until moisture penetrates to the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have spoken in the division of the species of Stone, and its cure with medicines: and I have said the difference between the Stone generated in the kidneys, and bladder, and the signs of all that: and I have said the Stone in which the operation falls with the hand and cutting: and it is a Stone generated in the bladder properly: and that which is fixed in the rod: and I am narrating that with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore, that the Stone generated in the bladder, happens most to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And of its signs is that urine comes out from the bladder similar to water in its thinness: and appears in it white sand, and the weak man rubs his rod, and labors with it, and many times it hangs.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is erected, and comes out with that the bottom in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing is easy for boys, as long as they are up to fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In youths, however, it is moderate, in that which is between the two: and of him whose Stone is larger, the cure is easier: and if small, the care is the opposite.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When therefore we arrive at the cure, it is necessary first to clean the weak man with a clyster, which will extract all the dung that is in his intestines: for this sometimes prevents the discovery of the Stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the weak man be taken by the feet, and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the Stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or jump from a high place many times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands are under his hips, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If I feel a stone in the space, then immediately with a cut above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	What if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe the index finger of the left hand with oil, if he is a weak child: or the middle finger if he is a young adult: and insert it into his anus, and feel for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn it little by little to the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press above it with your finger, and push it to the outside opposite the place of which you wish to make the incision: and instruct one attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another attendant to stretch the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles on the part away from the place in which the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the spatula of the incision, whose shape is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in that which is between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that it be externally ample and internally strict, according to the quantity that it is possible for the exit of the stone from it not being larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger which is in the anus compresses the stone at the incision, and it goes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that the stone which has angles and edges makes its exit difficult because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And it is smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore for those which have angles and edges, add to the incision.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	What if it does not go out thus, then it is necessary that you ingeniate above it: or bind above it with a decent instrument, whose extremity is like the Moon, which binds above the stone and does not slip from it: or that you insert under it an subtle instrument of curved extremity.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot sew above it, then enlarge the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	What if something of blood conquers you, cut it off with a ligature.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If there is more than one stone in the bladder, then first push the large one to the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards push a small one after that, and do likewise if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	What if the valve is very large, then it is ignorance to cut above it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because it happens to the weak one of two things, either that he dies, or that there occurs to him a continuous dripping of urine: therefore, because the place is not consolidated at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Direct the expulsion of it, until it comes out: or instruments on the fracture with forceps, until you extract it bit by bit.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with resin, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and put over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot aposteme may be assuaged.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then let the weak one rest on his neck, and do not loosen the bandage, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you then loosen it, bathe the place with water, and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the ointment called diaphenicum, and the ointment called basilicum, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however there occurs in the wound a hot and corroding aposteme, and similar things: as if blood coagulates in the bladder, and urine is prohibited from it: and this is recognized by the discharge of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and apply all the species with what is suitable from the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the hours of treatment of the whole, that you bind two hips, and gather, the causes of the medicines which are placed on the spot.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	What if the stone is small, and it is in the flesh of the rod, and it is fixed in it, and the exit of the urine is prohibited: then treat it with what I will narrate before you proceed to the cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times indeed you will be excused from cutting by this treatment, for I have already tested that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And there is, that you receive the perforator made of iron, whose form this is, a triangular extremity, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and bind the rod with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the iron perforator into the rod with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand in the stone little by little: and complete the perforation of it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For the urine will be freed at once.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on that which remains of the stone from the external part of the rod.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it itself breaks and comes out with the urine, and the weak man is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If however this treatment is not prepared for you, on account of something which prohibits it: then bind a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on the rod itself between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards loosen the bandage and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone, except that it does not return to the bladder; and another bandage above, except that when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and for that reason it is necessary for you, when you tie the upper thread, to elevate the skin upwards, so that it returns to its complement and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of a stone from women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A small stone is generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If however it happens that a stone forms in any of them, then the treatment is difficult and is forbidden because of many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, that you do not find a woman who reveals herself to the physician, when she is chaste, or among those having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, that you do not find a woman well skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the remoteness of the place of the stone: where it requires a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	What if necessity provokes to that, then it is necessary that you receive a woman physician, well skilled: and she is rarely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If indeed you are deprived of them, then seek a chaste physician, subtle, and present a woman midwife well taught in the matter of women, or a woman who has acquired a part of the art: make her therefore present, and especially instruct her, that she do all that you prescribe to her from the inquiry concerning the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	At first what is, to examine if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If then it finds it, it constricts it under its finger, and then orders the midwife to insert her finger into the weak womb, and feels above the stone, after which she places her left hand over the bladder, and presses it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If then it finds the stone, then it is necessary that she moves it gradually from the opening of the bladder to the lower areas with her greatest strength, until she reaches with it to the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she cuts above it at the opposite of the middle of the womb at the root of the hip, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone on that side: and her finger does not move away from the stone, constricting under it: and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she inserts the rasp over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If then she feels the stone, then she adds to the incision a second cut proportional in quantity to what the stone protrudes from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For from these is the small and the large, the smooth and the rough, the long, and the round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its kinds, so that it may be indicated to you through this above what you use.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If then blood overcomes you, then add to the place of the wound some pounded tragacanth, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out: and make that you prepare with you from the instruments, which I spoke of in the extraction of the stone from the bladder, so that you may help yourself by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	For if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which has been cut: then put powder on the place, and constrict it with decent strictures: and do not touch it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For a weak woman will surely die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of the blood has sat after some days and the place has become putrid, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On the cutting of a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is not a rupture, but an aggregation of humidity in the white membrane, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is named a membrane.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own proper membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it becomes putrid: which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white membrane, which we mentioned: and that does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this hernia is from weakness which happens to the testicles: for which reason this material flows to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this humidity has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For it is either a color leaning to yellow, or it is a bloody red, or a filthy black, or it is a watery white, and that which is most.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white membrane which we mentioned, then the swelling is round in length for a while as the figure of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the humidity contains it from every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if it is humidity in its own proper membrane, then the swelling is round with part of the egg, and because of this a man thinks that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the humidity is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you use the knowledge of the color of the humidity, then try the color of the humidity in the swelling with a probe that is inserted, whose shape has been described.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Secondly, I consider what comes out in the wake of the instrument that has been inserted, and I judge it by what is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we proceed to cure with iron, then it is necessary that you should prescribe to the weak, that they should be bled if possible, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should be made to lie on his back on a high seat or bench, and many cloths should be put under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on his left side, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right side, who should stretch out the vein to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the region of the navel.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle along its length, almost to the pectine: and let the incision be according to rectitude equidistant from the line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white cord that encompasses: and pare it and observe, or beware lest you cut from this, as you cut it: and your paring should be where it hangs with the egg more: and carefully examine with the paring according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then puncture the full cord with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with forceps, and stretch the cord upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles that encompasses: and cut the cord as much as it is possible for you to cut it, either in its entirety or bit by bit, especially the wide part subtlely.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine, in the cutting of it there will be no security, lest the water return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the egg proceeds outward from its skin during the time of your operation: then when you have completed the cutting of the cord, push it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as the rest of the wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	What if you find a corrupted vein from blackness of another, then it is necessary to tie the vessels, which are the suspensors, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspensor, and extract the vein: afterwards treat it with what we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water is collected in the two parts, then know that there are two channels: cut therefore one part equally as you did in the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it seems to you that it is one operation, then do it: afterwards wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions a thread soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and put on top another thread which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the navel: and put on top of that double cloths, and they are bandages: and tie them on top with a ligature, which has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then let two cloths be taken, and they be sewn, and filled with medicated wool, according to this likeness: and let extremities be made which are pressed from a cloth, or a wet thread: and let them be tied with a bandage around the loins of the arms: and one extremity take above the groin up to the back, and the second take at the part of the chest: and two extremities above the two hips below, and two other extremities above the two groins, and all the bandage be tied around the loins of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when the ramex is artificially treated with a cautery in place of the incision with iron: and it is, that you take a small knife-shaped cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is ignited, according to what we have described: until when it is discovered that there is an album containing water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It becomes like Greek poultices.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce that spongy flesh with it and it is cauterized until all the moisture goes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch the spongy flesh with forceps, and scrape it with a sharp burning cautery, and cut it according to what is possible for you, until you eradicate all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And cauterize from the egg, so that the fire does not touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer and less bloody and better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If indeed it shows opposition to you at the time of cutting, or at the time of cauterization, a hot aposteme, or a flow of blood, or something else, then it is necessary that you should cure what shows opposition to you from that with a cure that suits it, according to what has been said before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If however he is weak and fearful, and does not hope for this operation, because of its dreadfulness: then administer the piercing according to what I describe it to be.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certain to you from what we have said concerning the signs, that the humor is watery: then it is necessary that you should make the weak person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the aposteme in its lower part with a broad spatula, and make the piercing according to the length of the body, and let it be widely open, until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put a dressing on the place, and bind it, and leave it so that the remainder of the water can flow out: then treat it until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If however there is an obstruction to the flow of water at the time when you pierce it, and it does not happen except because the white pannicle makes an obstruction at the mouth of the wound, and prevents the exit of the water: then it is necessary that you should insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of dropsy is extracted, whose form I previously described: or add to the operation of the wound for a little while.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you should know that water returns and accumulates after six months, or around that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When therefore it has accumulated, then it will perforate according to the same method, and the weak days will pass.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the treatment of a fleshy ulcer.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should know that in the operation on this ulcer, there is a risk of destruction due to fear in many conditions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Wherefore it seems to me that its dismissal appears to be beneficial for its healing.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I recall an operation on it, and the appearance of a postule or boil.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore, that many boils occur in the bodies, from which the testicles are composed: and it happens for many reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from an excess of sharp or sour humors, which flow to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the boil is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious boil.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone boil, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the knotting of the arteries, and their swelling: as I have already mentioned before: or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That which is therefore from the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the condition of the boil, when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary that you touch it directly.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which happens from the swelling of the veins, does not disappear with pressing on it with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that an operation be performed on this type, and on the rest of the flesh: and it is to cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then stretch the cord upwards, and extract it with a curved needle: and free the suspension from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspension afterwards when you have freed it from every part of the cord.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If then the consolidated wound is with those born tissues, then it is necessary that you attract the wound and cut into it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if the adhesion is between something of the siphac, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary that you free the whole of that adhesion, and cut into it with a rounded incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however the nativity of the flesh is in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you cut the whole of it, and extract the wound, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool steeped in rose oil and wine: afterwards cure it with the remainder of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the treatment of varices, which is with a ligature.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	A hernia is an unreduced protrusion with a certain reduction, similar to a botrus, with softening of the testicles: and it makes difficult the motion and exercise and walking of the infirm.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure of this disease is fear, on account of that which has preceded, the memory of it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	It is necessary that we say the operation in it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that it is necessary that you make the infirm person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then apply a suspender to the testicles towards the lower parts.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with vessels which are near the virgin area: and let another assistant hold them, and stretch them with a violent stretching.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad sharp spatula a transverse section in the direction of the vessels, until the vessels are laid bare.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scratch from every part, as we have said to you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterwards fix on them a double thread where there is a filament, and tie it in the first places to which the veins arrive: and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in a straight cross-section according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from fetid corrupt humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which a force is generated to produce a sanative, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not an evil on account of that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	And if the vein happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles with the vessels be extracted on account of this: so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment, on account of the incision, and withers, or dries up, and is not a help with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Of the treatment of intestinal wounds.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The exit of this wound is from a section, which happens in the sifac extended over the belly in the groin area from the middle of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why the intestines protrude from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the sifac or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy thing, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign, when it is from an extension of the sifac.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an equal abscess on the surface as opposed to the depth: because the sifac compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And a sign of it when it is from a section of the sifac, because it causes to happen from the beginning a vehement pain suddenly: and it is a diverse abscess, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is on account of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifac.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it comes out with the intestine a piece: and this is called intestinal Ramex and zirbium: and when it happens with inflammation.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And when feces run into the intestine and are retained there: and it is with them a danger to the weak: because it causes severe pain to happen, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the cure of the species of this disease with iron there is fear: where it is necessary to beware of the case in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of treatment is, that you instruct the weak person, to reduce the intestine with his hand to the innermost parts of his concavity, if it has slipped back.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he should be lifted up over his neck between your hands: and his thighs should be elevated.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch the skin that follows the skin to the upper parts, and cut the skin of the testicles along its entire length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix on both lips of the incision hooks, according to which you will open the incision with them: and the incision should be according to the quantity that is possible, so that the egg can come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scratch the siphac, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white sifach is revealed, hard on every side: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white sifach, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the first and second sifach, and release with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the interior skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white sifach upwards, with your left hand: and lift the egg with the sifach to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant, that he should stretch the egg upwards: and you solve the adhesion, which is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers, so that there is not anything there inside the intestine involved in the sifak, against the hard white thing.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If you find something coming out of it, then push it to the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made from ten threads: and insert it at the end of the sifak, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the section: then cut the extremities which stick out from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over others with a figure that is in the shape of a cross: and tie them with the sifak, which we spoke of, which is under the skin of the testicles with a violent ligature, until it cannot send anything from the vessels that nourish them to them: so that there does not occur from it a hot aposteme.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And put again a second ligature outside the first ligature, at a distance from it less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, let out from the sifak, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity of the size of a finger: and cut the rest entirely around the circumference, and remove the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles at the incision, from which runs blood and pus: as we have described in what has been said before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer a thread soaked in oil, and put it on the wound: and administer the ligature that we described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes cauterize the white sifak that we mentioned, after the incision of it, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let go the ligature until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If however the case is delayed, then moisten it with warm water: and put on it what we said, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the remaining treatments for wounds, until it is cured.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Of the stitch with the thread.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this suture I have not seen anyone who has dared to undertake its cure with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first ones indeed said, that it should be done as we have described in the suture which is with the thread of vitis.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is, that you should tie the vessels after the incision above it with ease below: then cut in the middle, and treat afterwards with that which opens it, until the vessels fall: and treat the wound, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Of the hernia that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is very little, and returns every hour: but if it is prolonged with that time, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this occurs due to the extension of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is, that the sifach extends: then it becomes soft, and the area becomes inflamed, and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as the description of it has preceded.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron, in this manner: and it is, that the weak person lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the area of the ruptured and swollen place, a crosswise incision, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tie the alsifak and what is under the skin, until when the white sifach is revealed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a scalpel and place it on the prominent area of the spleen and press it to the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Next sew two prominent areas on the extremity of the scalpel from the spleen and connect one to another with a suture: then pull out the extremity of the scalpel.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the spleen at all, nor stretch a vein, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of intestinal rupture.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you cut the threads, clean it, and restore the wound, until it becomes consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the spleen contracts itself, and the prominence of the rupture is not added to.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cauterization is better in this place: because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles often becomes softened in certain men, because of which the flesh that is between them becomes softened and their appearance becomes disfigured.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for he who is asked to cure it, to make the weak one lie on his back, and to cut away all the skin that has been softened from the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture: and if necessary, or at first, the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and secure the suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is forbidden by our law: and because of this, it would be permitted for me not to mention it in my book: and it is not necessary to mention it, except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of them is that it should be in the science of the physician when he is questioned about it, and that he knows the cure for the one to whom it happens.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another method is that we often need to castrate certain animals because of our needs through them, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar ones among the animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by pulling.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by tearing and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by pulling, the method of operation is this: we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles become soft and relaxed, and hang down: then we pull them with our hand until they are torn apart and do not appear to touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by tearing and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory, and cut above all one ovum with a single section, until when two ovum proceed: then cut it after you have excised both, and do not leave on them anything of the sifaket except subtle sifac, which is above the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by pulling: because pulling perhaps leaves something of the testicles, for which reason the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	On the treatment of a hermaphrodite of two kinds.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from the members according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is that which appears in the space that follows, or on the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from that which is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women there is one species, and it is the vulva of the woman above the breast like the testicles of a small man entirely, standing out to the outside: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two like the two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three species, two from men and one species from women, is: that it is necessary to cut away the excess flesh until the impression of them disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the cure of remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second species of men, from which urine exits, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the cutting of the labia and the prominent flesh in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The labia possibly grow over the natural part, until they become ugly and their appearance is offensive: and sometimes they are enlarged in some women so much, that they spread out like in men, and reach to the coitus.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary therefore to hold the excess of the labia with the hand or with a hook, and to cut: and not to go too far in the cutting, especially in the depth of the root, so that there does not occur a flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	The flesh that arises is the flesh that is born in the opening of the uterus, until it fills it: and possibly it comes out to the exterior like a tail: and because of this some of the first call the disease a "tailed" disease.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore to cut it as we cut the labia, and to treat it, until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of the Imperforate, which is the woman's vulva not pierced.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The incision is such that it should be a woman's vulva not perforated or it should be a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from a disease which has preceded it: and this itself is made either from flesh born added, or from sifach subtle, or from a clamp: and it is made either in the depth of the matrix, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part: and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menses.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the recognition of it is made by the aspect of an obstetrician, if the obstruction is appearing nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the obstruction is from subtle sifach, and it is near the two lips: then touch it, and break it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it should be that you put upon the two lips a poultice.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your indexes of the two hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her thighs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch the two lips with force, until the subtle sifach is broken apart, and the obstruction is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a woolen thread, and soak it in oil, and put it on the place: and let the woman apply it every day, so that the place is not consolidated with another vice.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the sifach is thick and dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If however the obstruction is from flesh born, then suspend it with hooks, and incise it: and let there be with you medicines which quiet the flux of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus aggregated with the whites of eggs.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a lead pipe wide enough, so that the wound does not consolidate quickly, hold it for some days: and administer a plaster made from dry flax, then let the rest of the treatment be done, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when there is a birth of flesh in the matrix of the nativities, it is necessary that they be cut according to this method: since there is not an apostema which is cancerous, for the cancerous apostema that is in the matrix does not become contrary with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red pimples on the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed openings of the veins, insofar as there runs out from them much blood continually.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil: and I have already spoken about the division of their types, and their signs: and I will say here which of them receive a cure, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the matrix and do not appear to the senses: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those of them which are in the opening of the matrix and upon which the sensation falls, are those that can be cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary therefore that you put the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then stretch out the hemorrhoids with forceps or with coarse cloth, and cut them out from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then sprinkle over them at the flow of blood from one powder of incisions without biting: such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against a wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards put her into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and a crust of pomegranates, and gall, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If blood is cut off with it, it is good: and if not, make the ventoses adhere to the back and the breasts, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take a wool and submerge it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the branches of alaulat, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When then the aposteme quiets, treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	The Albarth herb is similar to the heads of alhaasse, and its appearance is rough.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary therefore that you cut what appears from it, according to what I said equally in the former: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Of the perforation of the uterus which occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 23.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	There occur in the matrix many kinds of apostemes, such as cancer, and aposteme of stones, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot aposteme.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already spoken of all these diseases and their kinds, and the signs of them, and their cures in division: it is necessary that I speak in this treatise of the hot aposteme which occurs in the matrix, when it is among the apostemes which collect blood, and you should know how its opening is done with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary therefore that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the aposteme in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it to be red: if sense falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps against maturation, until when the acuteness of the accidents quiets.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is appropriate that you make the woman sit on a seat that has two seats, and she should lean back or lie on her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of her abdomen: and her hips should be expanded, and she should put her arms under her thighs, and tie them with a convenient ligature.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of the matrix is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those things that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you administer this instrument, that you fix with the radius the depth of the woman's matrix: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the matrix, and hurts the weak part.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you put pillows on the surface of the depth of the matrix: so that the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the matrix is prohibited: and it is necessary that a loop, which runs on the instrument, be placed from the upper side: and that it hold the instrument, and that the servant turn the loop, until the depth of the matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by the hand, and it is gentle and soft: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the sanies is evacuated, then it is necessary that you put on the wound a dressing submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is a certain astringency: and put the dressing, and extract the section from the depth of the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put externally on the matrix, and on the navel a clean woolen cloth submerged in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated after two days with an ointment that is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix and wound are washed, it is cleaned with water and honey; then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled; then it returns to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	What if the wound is hidden within the matrix, then it is necessary that you prohibit the cure of it with iron, but rather cure it with what we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The doctrine of obstetrics, how they medically treat living embryos, according to an unnatural shape having emerged.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to recognize first the shape of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From the signs of it, is that when you see a woman compressed at the lower parts, and desires to smell the air, and there is relief over her what is over her from birth, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then know that this birth is according to natural shape, and its exit is over its head, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary that her womb be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over its head, the afterbirth descends with it, and is cleansed from those superfluities of a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Which however is beyond this birth, is unnatural, deserving no praise.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Since when the fetus exits over its feet, and its body exits before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and its hands exit: or its belly exits: and perhaps it is turned over its neck, and similar things from unnatural shapes.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary therefore for the obstetrician to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and beware of error and deception: and I am showing every shape from them, and how it is ingenious in it, and signified by that, and established upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus moves up above its head with its natural exit, and presses upon the woman, and parturition becomes difficult for her, and you see her virtue now weakened: then make her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her: and apply vapors to her vulva with decocted fumitory, and with humid oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the Midwife should insert between her fingers a small spatula, and find with it the secondine, and cut it with her nail, until there runs out what is in it from humidity: and press the belly of the woman, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If however it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given a clyster of fumitory mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her after the clyster, that she be compressed: and make her sneeze with condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	What if the two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you reduce them with ease little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If however it does not enter at the entrance, then put the woman on a seat, and lift her feet up high: then strike the seat against the ground: and let the woman be held, so that she does not fall with the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut them off, and extract the remainder of the fetus: and tie its hand with a cloth, and pull it out gently: for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The fetus comes out over its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out over its feet, then it is necessary that you push them up high: then turn the fetus little by little: afterwards pull it even.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and stretch it out little by little.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When the suppurating matter comes out up to the hips, then order him to compress it and make him sneeze with condiments: it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have described, then reduce the fart little by little until you put it in its natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will itself come out then with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	What if it is prohibited with all that we have described: then take from the mucus of the altea, and oil of sisamine, and dissolved gum: and strike the whole in a mortar with a good stroke: then smear the woman's vulva and her lower belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water, until she obtains a hypogastric discharge.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that her lower parts are already warmed, then make for her a seat of myrrh: and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she has held the seat for one hour, then make her sit on the seat.

Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out according to this form, then she should insert her hands gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should be lifted up over her neck, and her feet hang down to the lower parts: and she herself should sit leaning on a bed, and clasp her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press above her belly little by little.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under her feet from the dust, until it is prepared in the lower part.

Then attend to the reduction with the hands, and straighten the fetus according to its natural shape: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to press herself, until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus exits with its head behind its shoulders, its hands stretched out, and its face towards the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife should hold the hand of the fetus, then slowly turn it, and straighten it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is straightened, then put on its neck what we have prepared from oil and poultices.

Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail, until it is evacuated from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If indeed it hangs over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel, so that it is not retained and does not cause death.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.

¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or a fetus of many.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	But truly that is extraordinary, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five is a thing beyond nature, and they do not live long: and the afterbirth contains them, however many they are multiplied, one secundine: and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing between them the ligament at the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come out just as one fetus comes out with a natural and easy delivery: and they come out with a laudable delivery, as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	That if any of them are difficult at birth, and they reach that which we spoke of concerning unnatural positions, then treat them as we have described: and let it be by a subtle hand, and do what is done with ease and slowness, and it will be adapted according to every figure with what is prepared for it from the guiding intellect towards health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	The memory of that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and it has been verified by me, that a woman, aborting, expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	This therefore is all that is required to be in the science of Obstetrics.

¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I mentioned in the division from medication, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to use an operation with the hand, then it is necessary that you consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If the woman is of healthy strength, and is not with any of the accidents, from which loss is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be placed on a bed, on her back, and her head be inclined downwards, and her thighs be elevated: and an assistant hold her from both sides, or she be tied to the bed, so that her body not be moved during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then the mouth of the matrix is moistened with humid oils of linseed, and flax, and fenugreek.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife anoints her hand with these oils and mucilages: then she inserts it into the matrix with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she feels for the place where the nails will be fixed from the fetus, and the places convenient to it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend on its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its throat, or in places near the ribs, and under the hips.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however it descends on its feet, then in its chest, and in the middle of its ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and put the curvature of it between the fingers of the left hand: and insert it with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places which we mentioned, until she reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fix another hook or a third if necessary, opposite to it: so that the contraction be equal, and not decline to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended with an equal extension, and the extension should not be according to straightness only, but rather it should be moved to every part, so that its exit is alleviated, just as it is done with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is suitable for what is between them, that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	What if a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoints some fingers with oil, and inserts them from the side, so that she delivers with them what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then the hooks are moved to another place that is higher: do this until the entire fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand comes out before the other, and it is not possible to push it back, on account of its constriction: then it is necessary that a cloth is wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it out until when the whole comes out, cut it at the joint of the foot, or at the elbow: and so it is necessary that you do to the other hand, and to the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the head of the fetus is large, or it suffers constriction at the exit, or there is water collected on its head: then it is necessary that a spatula spinosa is inserted between the fingers, and finds with it the head, and extracts the water: or it breaks it with an instrument which is called Almisdac: whose shape comes with the shapes of other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, let it be done if the fetus is of a large head nature, then it is necessary that the shoulder is cut: or extract it with a misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	What if the head comes out and is constricted at the fork: then it should be pierced until the moisture that is in the chest is poured out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it is not complicated and does not obstruct the exit, then cut the head bit by bit, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	What if the lower part of the abscess is apostemated, or there is dropsy in it: then it is necessary that you perforate it, until humidity flows out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If the fetus is positioned over its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the matrix is slight.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is constricted at the belly or chest: then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped over your hand: and press the belly or chest, until what is in them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If the other limbs are delivered, and the head returns: then the Midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the mouth of the matrix is open, then she should insert her hand into the depth of the matrix, and search for the head with it, and draw it out with her fingers to the mouth of the matrix: then she should insert one hook, or two hooks, into it, and draw it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	What if the mouth of the matrix is constricted, on account of a hot apostema which has happened to it: then it is not necessary that she should labor over it, but rather it is necessary to administer an effusion of humid things, and apply plasters: and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	What if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it will equalize: then administer what we have said regarding a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	What if it is not possible, then cut bit by bit, and extract.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said regarding hot apostemas that happen to the matrices.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	What if it happens there is a flow of blood, then let it descend into astringent liquids, and administer the remainder of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: afterwards she became pregnant on top of it, then another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	It happened to her after a long time an abscess on her navel, and it became swollen, until it was opened: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was summoned therefore to her treatment, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound was not consolidated.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I placed therefore on it certain strong attractant plasters: and the bone came out from the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed for her, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was astonished therefore at that, since there is no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought therefore, that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I probed the wound, and extracted many bones, with the woman being in her better conditions: and she lived for a long time afterwards, and a little pus came out from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not confirm this strange thing, except that there is science in it, and assistance for that which the skilled physician administers with his hand from treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of necessary instruments for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 78.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	This below is the form of a Tightener, which has two equal arms, with two uprights at the ends of two wooden rods.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this Upright should be finer than the Tightener: and that it be made either of ebony or of boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each wooden rod is about two fingers: and the thickness of each of them is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two rods there are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is about two fingers or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn two Vertigines.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the Vertiginis by which the matrix is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	The form of another like that, more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made from ebony wood or boxwood, similar to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, on the extremity of it there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of all the addition from them is a palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you wish to open the matrix with it, then have the woman sit on a couch, her feet hanging down, with what is between her thighs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two additions joined together into the matrix, and you hold the extremity of the instrument below between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity that you wish from the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of another Vertiginis which the ancients called the form of the Impeller by which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of the Almisdac, by which the large head is compressed: and it is similar to forceps, which has teeth on the extremity, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made with a stop, like forceps according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it is cut and compressed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of the Almisdac by which the small head is compressed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of the Vncinus having one spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of the Vncinus having two spikes.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps which has saw-like teeth, with which the head of the fetus is compressed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The spatula has two extensions for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Shape of two broad Spatulas.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are to be exercised, and the more their kinds are multiplied and prepared by the artisan, the swifter will be his operation and the higher he will be among men, on account of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Do not therefore despise any of them, so that it may be prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	Their necessity is indeed inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the extraction of the Secondine.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter Seventy-Eight.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Secondine is retained with the afterbirth, then it is necessary that you should precipitate the weaker one, so that it may retain its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make it sneeze with a condiment: and press your hand over its mouth, and its nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If then it comes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and perforate in its cover an opening: and put in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and sesame, and lignous cassia, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a bulb of reeds over the opening of the pot, and another end into the mouth of the womb: and hold it until the vapour penetrates to the concavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make it sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the Secondine will come out with facility.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this cure, and does not come out: then instruct the Midwife, that she should submerge her hand in oil of sesame, or mallow.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he should insert it into the wound and look for the secondary wound with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore he has found it, then he should take it and pull it out gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If it is attached deep within the womb, then he should insert his hand, as we have described, until when he finds the secondary wound, and pull it out gradually according to what is right, so that the womb does not fall during violent pulling: indeed it should be turned with ease to the right and left sides: then add to the amount of the pulling.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it detaches itself then, and is saved, and comes away from the adhering things.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	What if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with fumigation, and from a medication of a poultice with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If however it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you weary yourself over it in the repetition of the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is necessary indeed, that what comes out to the mouth of the womb from it, should be tied to the thigh of the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then anoint her with the ointment tetrapharmacon.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will rot it after some days, and it will dissolve, and will come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	Truly when it rots, there rises from it a bad smell to the stomach and head, and it harms that weak woman.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	It is necessary therefore that fumigations suitable for that be administered.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Certain of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and figs of sycar.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of an instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of the secundina and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let a vessel be made similar to an alcama, or from clay: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be put on the coals: let her hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and then another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the treatment of a non-perforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many of the boys are born, and their anuses are not perforated, which the subtle siphac has already obstructed.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary therefore, that the midwife should perforate the siphac with her finger: and if not, she should perforate it with a sharp style: and let her beware of the intestine, lest it touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put on top of it a piece of wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If however the time comes that it becomes obstructed, then put a lead pipe in the opening for many days, and it will be removed when the boy wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now obstruction of the anus also occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore that the consolidation be cut, then treated with what we have said concerning treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	The fistulas that occur in the lower part are a knot and a thickness that occur near the anus of the fundament or in the space of one of the parts: and it is one fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that knot becomes chronic, it opens, and a watery white humidity or subtle pus flows out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes there are ones of these fistulas that penetrate.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore the penetrating ones are recognized by that which comes out from the bowel movement and flatulence, when the sick person uses the bowel movement: and perhaps worms come out from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are ones of these fistulas when they penetrate the space up to the bladder and up to the passage of the rod.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And there are ones of them that penetrate up to the joining of the hip and up to the knot of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that which is known, the penetrating fistula reaches to the anus, and also from the non-penetrating one, it is so that you insert your index finger into the anus, and you insert a subtle probe made of air or iron when there is no tortuousness.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	What if there is tortuousness in it, then insert into it a subtle probe made of lead, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe or the hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	What if you do not feel it deeply, nor does anything proceed from the orifice by way of excretion, nor wind, nor worm as I have said: then know that it is non-penetrating: proceed therefore to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder or to the urine passage: then its signification is the exit of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place may be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it is penetrating to the hip joint or to the mouth of the hip: then its sign is that the probe penetrates up to that place, if there is no tortuousness up to the mouth: and the finding of pain in the surrounding part, and that pus always comes out from it: and that medicine is not effective in it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and the treatment of them is labor and vanity to him, from foolish medicines, on which it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that which is not penetrating and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a plaster: according to what I relate to you, and I have already proven: and it is, so that the weak person lies on his back between your hands, and you elevate his legs up above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert a lead or copper probe, if there is tortuousness in the fistula, until you know where the probe penetrates.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If however he feels it weak around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel on your finger the probe having already penetrated by itself and detected, besides what you feel between your finger and the anus or flesh, then therefore you know for certain that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor in it, since its treatment is not like what we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They have said, however, that the flesh is healed in some men and from the medication which is hoped for as a remedy, it is that you make a subtle cauterization according to the width of the Fistula, as was previously described, and insert the ignited thing into the Fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that two or three times, until you know that all those fleshy growths which are like the quill of a bird's feather have already been burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with cloths wrapped in butter, until those growths that have been burned come out: then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it does not heal with another cure of an ointment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe comes out and has not reached up to your finger which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick covering of flesh or sifac: and you see the Fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the Fistula, and you direct the cutting with the probe that is in the fistula, until the cutting reaches where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those fleshy growths that resemble the quill of a bird's feather, so that none of them remain.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however blood overcomes you, and it separates between you and your operation so that you cut those flesh: then what is done is better, and for the speedy healing, it is to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Since the cauterization with fire aggregates good habits, it adds to the burning of those flesh, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying of moistures.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with liniments wrapped in butter, or with pounded cabbage, until the place emits pus, and the burned flesh goes out into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which generate hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there are astringents and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then already it is healed: and do not repeat the treatment.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has already perforated to the depth of the anus, and it is prolonged from the excess of body, then insert your finger into the anus, and examine with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a tension, and between you and it there is a covering of sifac, or flesh, and it is near to the penetration: then there is no operation on that, except according to the way of confidence and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is, that one of the three methods is administered in it: either that you cauterize it, as we have said: or that you cut it, until you obtain its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert liniments, and a cure from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed far with the cutting, lest you injure the membrane that contains the anus, and it happens above the weak exit of the involuntary evacuation without control.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed: or you stretch the covering, and cleanse it after you cut it up to near the anus, as we have said, either with a probe, or with another instrument of sharp extremity.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filtered flesh parts that are in the incision, until where you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then be concerned with the restoration of the entire wound with the incision, and the upper opening where it consolidates, and a remaining fistula open in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier on the weaker.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when a fistula follows in this manner: and it is, when you insert a probe into the Fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus: then take the probe of the perforated extremity, which is like a needle, that is, preparing the tissues, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wound from five threads, and tie around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the Fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If then it is penetrating the margin of the anus internally near, then pull out the thread from that hole: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring together the two ends: and tie both, and leave it for one day, or two days: and as much as the thread cuts into the flesh, tie it well, until the flesh that is between the two ends of the thread is cut, and falls: then treat the wound, until it consolidates, and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the opening of the Fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate by whatever method is prepared for you, unless it is deep within.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you should not do that on account of the pain, so as not to cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the spatula for a fistulous spine, which is found where the fistula is, whose curvature is sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from the incision of them: and the cure of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two modes.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are inside the anus, similar to vessels of charcoal, or of nuts: or as if they themselves were grain of a nut.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And of them there are small ones, and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and it is one, and they are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	Truly however those that are outside the anus, are for the most part small in humidity, from which flows yellow water, or a little blood with constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is inside the anus, is that you should press on the weak one so that it slips out: and it is squeezed, until the anus comes out, and the threads appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore hang them with hooks: or hold them with your finger.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If however they are not retained by the hooks, on account of their humidity and softening: then take them with rough cloth, or with a napkin made from coarse wool, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and powder over them after the incision certain hot powders, so that they may serve in place of a cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	Which if the anus does not obey for evacuation, then give a cluster of enema in which there is a little mordication, so that it may strike with what is in the anus, and it obeys evacuation quickly, when the weak one evacuates.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however the hemorrhoids are extracted from the anus then their treatment is easy and simple and it is like you catch them with your finger or catch them with a hook and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever shuns cutting with iron, then it is fitting that you administer their suture according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a thread and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull the hemorrhoid upwards and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the other side: and tie the two ends of the thread on the lower part of the needle, and let them be crosswise: and constrict the hemorrhoid with a strong tightening.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread and withdraw the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the hemorrhoids and leave one of them alone: nor let itself, so that blood flows out excessively from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate, and put it on the anus: and order the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it alone until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and the remainder of the treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Of the treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often it happens from dryness of the feces and constriction of the nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they become old and medicine does not penetrate them: then it is fitting that you rub with the points of a spatula or with your finger until they become moist and the outer skin which prevents them from consolidating is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them until they consolidate according to what is fitting.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If however they do not consolidate: then rub them again with a more vehement rubbing than the first, until they bleed much, and afterwards treat them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted piles, and of hemorrhoids, and of fistulas.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a club: and it occurs in the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet, and toes: and pain happens from them during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary therefore that what is around the club should be cut, and it should be held with forceps, or with a hook, and it should be eradicated from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat that: and if you want to cauterize it according to what was previously mentioned in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From the dry hemorrhoids one is a small, rough, flat, round eminence on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the treatment of it is, that you should stretch the hemorrhoid, and cut it: or tie it with a silk thread: or with a probe, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you want, cauterize it according to what was previously mentioned with fire, or with sharp medicine: and now both the inverted and non-inverted hemorrhoids are eradicated with an instrument that I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A boil is also a small, flat, thick elevation on the surface of the body, going deep into the flesh: and when it meets cold, it feels like the biting of a ant, and it occurs in the whole body: and most often it occurs in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And the treatment of it is, that you should take a small tube from a goose feather, or a strong vulture's feather: and put that tube over the boil, until the circle of the tube constricts its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then move your hand with the tube, until you cut what is around the boil: and you put it deep into the flesh, and eradicate the boil from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you use it, make that with a copper or iron tube, according to this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the tube be drawn to subtlety so that the thread wraps around it, so that the grasp of the finger is alleviated and its own rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you use cauterization of ants according to what was previously mentioned in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Of the forms of instruments which are administered for clysters in diseases of the anus, and for the relief of the belly, and for colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes the clyster is made from silver, or from gilt, or from copper, or from brass.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made small and large from these instruments, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	That which is administered in the treatment of little children should be small: and those whose anuses are weak, or painful, so also their clysters.
Clistere magnum.	Large clyster.
Cistere paruum.	Small clyster.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The tube of it, that is, the upper head in which the string is tied, should be spacious according to this method: and it should have a distinction so that the string can be tied as you see, and the lower end which is inserted into the anus, should be smooth, that is, not open, gentle, very, drawn to subtlety: and on one side of it there should be two openings, and on the other side one opening.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the opening should be according to the thickness of the rods, and a little thicker, and there should be a string in which medicines are placed from the bladder of an animal: or from paper, which is according to the shape of a small asafoetida: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be perforated with many openings as it revolves, and the space that is between all the openings should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those openings a strong thread made from coarse thread, which should be of ten threads or thereabout, and mix with it the wool like gum arabic.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore the wool is placed in it, a thread should be tied at its head between two distinguishing constrictions of the rectal clamp.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then tie the cluster with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle and the utensils depicted here, and of the openings.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of tying with it, is that you fill the wool or the bladder with medicine, which should be warmed according to the quantity of the tolerance of the weak person: and beware lest it be very hot or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the weak person should be placed on his back and lift his thighs upwards: and put under him an inthan, that is, a skin upon which men sit, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the extremity of the rectal clamp with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucus of the flax seed, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the assistant should take the wool with both his hands at once, and squeeze it out with force, until he evacuates all that is in the rectal clamp into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then withdraw the rectal clamp, and let the weak person lift his thighs to his side.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine brings it to the end, then let him hold back as much as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more beneficial for the treatment.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If however you administer it to him in diseases of abdominal flux, and its evacuation is hastened: then repeat the rectal clamp until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful boils in the anus, then let the rectal clamp be very subtle, gentle, from those rectal clamps with which children are treated.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a subtle enema on which the skin is tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of head wounds without fracture of bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head, 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the division of the treatment of wounds that which pertained to the book, and I will say here the treatment of them with the hand, and with medicines according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore, that wounds are diversified according to that by which the wounds are made, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things by which wounds are made are often such as the throw of a stone, or the cut of a sword, or the blow of a cudgel, or the thrust with a spear, or a stick, or an arrow, and similar things to these many.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	The wounds which are made according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver, and similar ones from these members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may put that reasoning and rule on the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the discussion of compound fractures will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When there is a simple wound on the head and it is not a fracture of bone: consider then if it is from the throw of a stone, or similar things, and has only broken the skin: and it is a great wound, and you apply on top a warm poultice for an aposteme: then do bloodletting at once, and do not delay it: and take out from the blood according to the quantity of its virtue: if there is nothing that prohibits bloodletting, especially if the blood which comes out of the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the weak man beware of excess, and wine, and coarse foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If anything prohibits diminishment, then he should diminish from food, and not approach flesh, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put on the wound if it happens to him a warm aposteme, a plaster infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are safe from the warm aposteme, then put on the wound, if it is recent with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, a powder which I will describe after a little while: and if the air has already changed it, then put on it certain ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large, or is from a cut by a sword, and similar things: and its lips do not stick together with threads, then stick them together with a suture, according to what I will describe for wounds of the belly concerning their suture.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the wound has already been torn from the bone, and is hanging, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension, then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in place of skin, and order the weak person to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as are heads and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulse: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	What if you find in the skin putrefaction, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the entire putrid thing, and throw it away: then treat that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however in these wounds there is an artery, or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not separated by medicines, then tie above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not cut, then cut it with a spatula, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if necessity demands it when that which we have said does not suffice, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small and simple, then their treatment is easy and light: so that you powder over them this powder: because it consolidates them before it changes their appearance.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of the Powder for Incurring Flesh Wounds.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of olibanum and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime: pound all together much, and sieve: and fill the wound with it, and bind with a good bandage, until it adheres well to the wound, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then tie it above with a string, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not become an aposteme.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine should not be eradicated from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when lime alone does that, when you do not have olibanum and dragon's blood present, and also dragon's blood performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is suitable to be placed on them and bound, and they are fresh wounds with their own blood, which has not been altered by the air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	For if the wound has already been altered by the air due to some alteration, especially when it is in the summer season, then the intention of this powder is not in position: therefore treat it with what we have said, so that you place on them certain digestive ointments: or place on them poultices made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat the remaining things with treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it happens with a wound and a fracture of the bone, and it is small, then extract it with Gestus: and I will already speak about the treatment of fractures of the head in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Of the wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound happens on the neck, then there is no difference between it and a head wound as regards treatment when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If the nerve of the neck is cut, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no ingenuity in it, except that the treatment of it must be undertaken with what causes violent constriction, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For they injure nerves and constrict them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And you should not put anything cold on the wound at all: for the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most elevated of the membranes: and let that with which it is treated be mild medicines, such as calx lota with sweet water infused several times with oil, or with rose oil and tutty, when it is washed also with sweet water: and other mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then administer a suture: or constrict its lips with poultices.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the wound has depth, or if a sinus forms on its lower part, in which pus is already collecting, then perforate it in the most depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	For if an artery has been cut in the wound and a flow of its blood follows: then separate, or cut it out, and ligate it: or cauterize it, if necessity calls for that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If the cartilages of the throat have been cut, or all of them, and the alhaudegi are preserved: then bring together the lips of the skin with a suture over the cane of the throat, and do not touch the throat, but reduce it to its natural figure.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten it with a bandage for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments which have astringency and excitation, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then perforate it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of them, or as many as you can: and what is not prepared, leave it, until the wound becomes putrid, and is separated and the protrusion is alleviated.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	What if the wound is fresh, then powder over it the powder which I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If however a bone is seen in the wound and a fistula is formed: then treat it with that which I have mentioned in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Of the wound on the shoulder blade.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a thrust of a spear or a dagger, and you see its depth, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore a windiness comes out of the wound, when the weak person breathes from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	What if the depth is not to it, and it is fresh with its blood: then do not put on it powder from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the weak person: but put on it an attractive ointment, and dress it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If indeed the ointment is not present to you, then put in the opening of the wound old cloth, so that it sucks up what comes out from it due to moistures: and make the weak person sleep on the wound, so that what gathers in it runs.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed the wound has already passed three days, or more, and no spasm has happened to the weak person, nor evil trembling of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see its other dispositions good: then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Treatment is applied to it and with bandages, and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If the skin is excavated for its healing, and now it always opens, then you should know that a fistula has already been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Treatment is applied to it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut of a sword, or a knife, and is simple on the surface of the breast, or back: then treat it with what preceded concerning suture, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If however it has already made an impression on the bone, and a fragment has been cut from it: then investigate the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If indeed they are not separated, then leave them alone, until the wound becomes putrid, for the extraction of them will be alleviated.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment of other accidental wounds in other limbs, in treatment, is the same judgment that we have already spoken.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Of wounds of the abdomen, and the protrusion of the intestines, and their treatment.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs to the abdomen is great, and moderate, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From a great one, therefore, when the intestine, or many of the intestines, protrudes outward.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Which is why their introduction and their suture is more vehement and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption is also made difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore it follows that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hasten to introduce them back to their place immediately: for it swells, opens, and becomes enlarged: which is why the entrance of it becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	On account of this therefore, a moderate disruption is better than the others: since with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of a vein is second to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common suture methods come together in the suture of a vein, and in the suture of other wounds of the body; and two other special suture methods are suited to the rest of the wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	But they are more properly associated with the suture of a vein: and I will describe to you each one with explanation, and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, that when a wound is small, and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is suitable for one of the two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said: or since there is inflammation in the intestine on account of cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is thus, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a moist cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil in water cypress and cumin, and spike lavender and chamomile with it on the intestine, until the inflammation is relieved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes make a wine in which there is astringency: and it is better than water alone for relieving inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflammation has already been relieved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by that the entrance of it is alleviated with something small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if its return is hastened after this cure, then find in the disruption a little, with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when prepared, than cutting: and there is no need to cut after necessity and lack of an instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted and acute, and the other part not acute, and the extremity subtle not with the subtlety of a spatula, but rather more blunt for a little while: and it is that which resembles a forceps, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, then it is necessary that there be a reduction of it according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible, over the wound, because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the disruption is large in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that you make the weak one lie on its back, and put its legs higher than its head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then put its head, and its chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then put your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which there is a wound be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds, and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, put it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make that the assistant who holds the disrupted part with their hand is present between your hands, and bring its lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then let him who follows remove from it a suture something after something, and this is the common method of one suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's depth.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then measure from the edge of the disruption the quantity of a finger ring, that is, of the physician, and fix one needle beyond what you insert in it thread at the two edges of the skin, with the two edges of the suture which is under the skin from the interior, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together two edges of the skin, and two edges of the suture: and there are four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with double thread around the needle several times from both parts at once, until the two lips of the wound are brought together by a proper union.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then cut the thickness of the digit and also fix a needle in them: afterwards tie it with a thread, just as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not cease to do that with what you insert from needles until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be medium between thickness and fineness: for subtle needles easily pierce the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin: because of that it is necessary that they be medium in fineness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in two extreme parts of the skin close together: so that the flesh does not pierce quickly, and the wound opens before its consolidation, and they do not stretch also with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the end of the threads, so that they do not harm the weak part during its sleep: and put pillows made of cloth on all sides, which hold the ends of the threads: and leave them, until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For one or two needles, or around them, are sufficient for the suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second common suture is that you bring together with the suture four ends: two ends of the skin and two ends of the thread in one place, with a needle in which is a thread wound equal in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you penetrate with the needle these four ends, draw back the needle from the part where you began, so that the thread tied on the upper part of the wound falls: so that it is a suture, like the suture of cloth which clothes are sewn with, and put between every suture the quantity of the thickness of a small digit.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	These men know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I have sewn a wound that occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and there was a large disruption of the wound the size of one palm, and about two palms worth of intestines had come out of the middle intestine, and there was a disruption in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I put it back after his intestine had stayed outside the wound for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was then consolidated in a period of about 15 days: and I treated it, and it healed: and he lived many years after that, acting in his own affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where no ointment was to be found, nor any of the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I put therefore an old cloth over the wound, twice a day, and I persisted in washing it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will describe two proper kinds of suture according to the account of my discourse.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is that you begin with a sharp suture, and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle thus penetrates the skin, and into the flesh that is cut according to the length and width of the whole body: leave the thread end on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate from the inner part to the outer in the other thread end at the other side of the wound.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate thus in the same thread end of the wound from the outer part to the inner: and leave the thread end that is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other thread end from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration that you make it penetrate in the thread end of the wound, which is on its part, until it penetrates into it entirely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then take hold of it also from this same side, and pull it out with the extremity that is from the sifac on the other side, and extract the needle from the skin which it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce it to that skin, and pull out the extremity of the sifac that is on the other side with this extremity of the mirach: and extract it from the skin which is on its own part, and do one side and the other: and do that side after the other side, until you have extracted all of it according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that you should sew up the pellets which sew up the skins: just as you should put the sifac on one side with one extremity of the skin: and that you should let it go on the other side with another, until you have finished.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of its own suture, which Galenus called.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech of his has been related thus, that they should sew it up according to the likeness, which some physicians sew them up, so that they join every part to its proper part by nature: and apply the extremity of the sifac to its other extremity, and the extremity of the mirach to its other extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I relate to you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you should fasten the needle in the extremity of the mirach nearest to you from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the interior in that alone: and let go two extremities of the sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle around, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the interior in the two extremities of the sifac, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both around, and make both penetrate from the interior to the exterior, into the two other extremities of the mirach, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common suture and it is a suture whose success precedes memory.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the treatment of Galen also.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some have said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly is tightened with two fingers.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, so that you insert into them both one thread: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from what is at your hands, and make it penetrate up to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew leathers equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when a disruption is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than that of the other places of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the treatment of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you treat a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and sew it, and adapt it: then put on top an incarnative powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	That if the air has already altered the wound: then put on it certain ointments, which are present to you, until they make pus: and the threads fall, and consolidate the tissue, and form a scar.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If however the medicines are not present to you, then put on it immediately, from which it begins to emit pus, old coturn: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not use other medications in many treatments, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If however you fear that the wound communicates with the principal members in a lesion, then it is necessary that you soak woolen threads in tempered oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil: and put them on the circumference of the places which are between the groin, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	What if he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for that often happens) then a clyster with styptic wine, black, and warm: especially if the putrefaction has already entered the intestine, and a penetrating fistula has been made up to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the large intestine, is of easier healing: and what is from them is from the subtle, of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine which is called Jejunum, does not receive healing from a wound that happens in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is from the veins, and their greatness, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If what proceeds from the wound is a flow, and you treat it freshly: reduce it according to your reduction, whereby you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If indeed it has passed the space, and already has become green or black: then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place which has been discolored from it, so that there does not happen a flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the flow are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and put two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so that the attraction of it may be alleviated over you, and the extraction of it at the time of flow, and emission of pus of the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A remembering of the wound which happens in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a disruption happens in the intestine and is small: then it is possible that it be restored in certain men: because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with the thrust of a spear, and the wound was on the right stomach, and the wound became old, and a fistula was made, and there came out from it an egestion and flatulence.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I applied a treatment, until what I was not confident of in its healing: nor did I cease to refine it, until it was healed, and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the weak spot, that a weak accident would happen on the weak spot, an accident in its belly: and no accident happened to it from that accident.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And it remained in its better dispositions, eating and drinking, and farting, and it entered the bath, and was exercised in its diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now certain testers have said that when an injury happens in the intestine and it is small: then it should be bound in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you take poultices of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and put one poultice of those which have an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it seizes upon them, and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres, and is not loosened.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then put another poultice near the first, and do not cease to do that with a poultice after a poultice according to the quantity of the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and heal its wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is digested and healed, and no harm happens to the weak person at all.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible, that the intestine be bound with a thin thread: which is taken from the intestine of an animal, and attached to it after it is inserted on a needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and much flesh is scraped away.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie on its end a thread of linen wrapped around.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it in a fracture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is not unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is great, large, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines: then there is no ingenuity except subtlety, and its healing is not at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound, or abscess when it becomes old and aged, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and does not separate: then it is called universally in whichever member it may be a Fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a Fistula indeed is according to truth a hard, white, calloused nodulation: with which there is no pain, to which is attached the feather of a bird: and on account of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours humid, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the humidity is discharged at certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this humidity is much, and it is little: and it is thick, and it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already mentioned in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor is born in it flesh, is not that except on account of one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of which is, or on account of the smallness of blood in the body: or on account of its malice: or because between it and above its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the birth of flesh: or because it is of much filth and foulness: or because the ulcer in itself is putrid, and the matter which is applied to it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is inconvenient for its cure: or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or by the property of the region, as it happens in Caesaraugusta: in which difficult digestion of ailments occurs, and the healing of abscesses is delayed in it by nature: or because in it there is one mouth, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division; and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For some of them are Fistulas that pass into the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or the spleen, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the composite joints of a composition: such as the hand, and foot: and some of them are which reach to the proximity of the principal member, and similar things.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which therefore of these Fistulas is according to this method, is from diseases of difficult healing, and does not receive cure, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	That if it is one of the Fistulas whose depth does not reach to these places which I mentioned: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and you use to reach the knowledge of it, then take a probe made of bronze, or iron, if the Fistula tends according to straightness, and investigate it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If however there is tortuousness in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe of refined lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead, with gentleness of its body, is lifted and turned around the tortuousness.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	That if the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to examine it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore close one of its openings from its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture that you close it with, goes back to the other openings, and flows out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully inquire according to which method it is possible for you: to know what that place is, or a nerve, and whether it is a Fistula with a long or short concavity: or if it is one Fistula which has many openings, and stands on the whole of that, with the greatest fortitude of yours: with your interrogation, which you interrogate the weak, and the invention of pain upon compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and causes of accidents found.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you stand over all those stations of that place, then proceed to cure according to confidence: and it is, as you consider then, if there is a fistula appearing near or in a healthy place far from the joint, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places I told you about: then cut the Fistula according to what was previously mentioned from my narration, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupt flesh, which grows in its opening from flesh, or pus, and similar things: and cure it, until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If the fistula is of deep and distant length, and it is according to straightness: then it is necessary that you cut it as deeply as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then clean it out from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer the unguents in acute medicines: and introduce them up to the concavity of the fistula which you grasped with the iron: do that several times, until the acute medicine corrodes all that remained in the concavity of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal by that method, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	When the cause of the fistula is a hole, and it is confirmed to you: then investigate it, and cut it according to what I have narrated to you: if nothing prohibits you from the vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	When a hole is detected by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it, until all its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then cure it with what will make flesh on it, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	What if it does not heal, and emits pus as it was doing: then know that you did not reach the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Remove that thing from above it in the second place and make a cut of it and cleansing of it with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If then it is healed, it is good: and if not, then you should know that the corruption is in the depth of the remote body part, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	There is therefore no ingenuity for you in it, except to entrust it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	What if the small mouth is corrupted and it is possible for you, draw it with subtle forceps that fit onto it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If however there are many bones, then make a careful pulling of all of them, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If indeed something among the moistures causes opposition to you, and there is no fear of incision or error: then cut those moistures and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If indeed you do not have preparation to remove the bones from your hour, then put on the wound what will rot it: and leave it, until it rots what is around those bones of flesh and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And let the section which you cut in your operation be bound with a ligature.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Below put on it, if you wish, a plaster submerged in sulphur beaten with oil: or a plaster submerged in Egyptian ointment, or some of the green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those moistures rot, and the bones are separated from them, the removal of them will be easy, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If however there is one large bone, such as the bone of the thigh or the hip bone, and similar to these, and what of it is corrupted is a large part: then scrape it with a final scraping, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If the corrupted part which is in it is a large portion, and the corruption has already affected the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and to cut it entirely up to the place where the corruption penetrates: then treat it, until it becomes consolidated.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you a story about a man who had an injury on his thigh: so that you may consider it as an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a man of youthful age, about thirty years old, to whom pain occurred in his thigh, from a cause which moved upon it within the body, that is, from the interior, until the matter reached the thigh and became an abscess, a large abscess: and there was no external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	It was extended therefore with him the time when there was an error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many matters ran together with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was put off, until his thigh became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus, and the moistures of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	A multitude of physicians therefore treated him for about two years, and there was not in it a wise hand in the art, until I was called, and I saw his thigh, and the matters which ran out of those openings with a great flow: also the whole body of the man had already wasted away, and its color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I then inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached to the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings, and I found that they connected to each other from all parts of the thigh.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I cut therefore and I separated above one of those openings, until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted, which had already been gnawed away, and was blackened, and rotten, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I will restore what has been lost to me, and prepared from a corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I have cut away what was not on the bone except for that corruption which I excised and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I will now eradicate it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it has not been consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed and examined the bone a second time above the first detection, and I found continuous corruption with the bone, and I sawed what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I examined therefore the bone again, and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut around one palm from the bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was consolidated quickly, and healed: and this repetition in the operation and cutting of it would not have been necessary, except because of the disposition of weakness and infirmity, and scarcity of tolerance of it, and my fear concerning it of death: since there occurred to him in every hour from an excess of evacuation of bad syncope.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was healed therefore with complete healing: and hard flesh was born in the place of the bone, and a good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he turned to his habits: and walking did not cause him any harm at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If the prominent bone in the body is already broken, then it is necessary to saw it in this manner: and it is done by taking a bandage, and tying it at the extremity of the prominent bone: and instruct someone, who should pull it upwards: and put another bandage made of coarse wool on top of the first bandage.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it above the flesh that is under the bone and extend the extremity so you pull the flesh to the lower parts and you will dissect the flesh above the place you want to saw, so the saw does not wound the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Put a stick or a plate under the lower bone decently: for when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the sawing be above the corrupted place for a little while, so the corruption is not in the cavity of the bone, and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and forces itself to be sawn instead of another.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	For if the bone is corrupted and it is not prominent, namely the part of it continues with a part, and the corruption is in the middle of it or in a part of it, then dissect the flesh from all parts entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then put a stick below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards saw it from the first side, where the corruption is, until the sawing continues from the other side: and let the sawing be according to the length a little away from the corruption, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	For if the corruption is in the joint, cut out the corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it continues from the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the corruption is in the connection of two joints, then there is no ingenuity in it except scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	For if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or in the sole of the foot, then the matter in it is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	It is necessary that you investigate the corruption as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it and clean it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever ingenuity is right for you: when the vein or nerve does not make a contradiction for you.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you should know that the incisions and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and fineness, and size, and smallness, and hardness, and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Wherefore it is necessary that you prepare every kind of instrumental apparatus suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you the type of instrument which you need when you have a lengthy study with it.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the modes of this art is testimony of the modes of ailments then indeed you will find by yourself that which is suitable for it from instruments for every weakness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I affirm to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will give as examples upon which you will stumble and a trial with which you will test other things.
Forma Serrae.	The shape of a saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of the other saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This shape of a saw, having been depicted, is actually made crooked.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper bow be sharpened, its point be of iron and its handle be of boxwood, and let it be made pyramidal, crooked.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The shape of a razor for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be according to the shape of the head of a star-shaped key and its points be according to the shape of the points of an awl.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not fit unless the joints are rubbed with it when they become corroded or the mouth is wide and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The shape of a larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The shape of a medium razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The shape of a broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape of a razor in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The shape of another delicate razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape of a razor with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The shape of a small razor, delicate handle.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The shape of a razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The shape also of a large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a file, and its outer edge is like a saw: it is exhibited in many places for the scraping of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of a rasp which is suited for the scraping of that which is perforated by bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its outer edge is triangular, and it is sharp at the edges.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from Indian steel.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And it is similarly necessary that all the things we have spoken of should be made from rasps, and incisors, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the incision of edges, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities rot, either from an external cause or an intrinsic one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated that corruption with medical cures, and the treatment does not work: and you see the corruption spreading to the member, which nothing can penetrate: then it is necessary to cut into that member until where the corruption has reached, so that he may be saved from death, or from the evil which is a greater defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign to which it happens is that the member blackens, until it becomes putrid: as if fire had burned it, or it had rotted after blackening: until the putrefaction is cut into, up to that which follows that member, and spreads through the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	It is proper therefore with the incision of it, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain venomous things: such as the sea scorpion, and viper, and rue, and similar things.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption or sting is in the extremity of a finger, then cut into the finger, and do not give space to the corruption, lest it spread up to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut into it from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption, until it takes hold in the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades into it, then cut the arm at the elbow at its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however corruption passes through and you see it around the elbow then in that is death of the weak.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that from the cure, is a quantity of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And do similarly for the foot, when corruption invades into the toe, then cut it at one of the joints: and if it reaches to the body of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	What if corruption has already gone beyond the knee, then there is not in it ingenuity, except abandonment, and to leave the weak to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting a limb, or sawing it, is that you tie a ligature below, which you want to cut: and tie another ligature above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let one assistant stretch a lower ligature downwards: and let another assistant stretch an upper ligature upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures, with a broad spatula, until the whole flesh is detached.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then let it be cut or sawn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is fitting, that you put a linen cloth on all parts, and the saw does not touch the healthy place: and there happens to the weak a lesion added, and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however there happens an internal flow of blood while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly: or put on it some powders that staunch blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a bandage suitable for it, and treat it, until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happened to a man with his foot, this same thing that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What is, that a blackening occurs in his foot, with a burning which resembles that of fire; and this corruption first occurs in his toe, until it begins to affect the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	It purified a man by itself, after it saw the corruption befalling the member with its swelling, which it found from the pain and burning of it: and it befall the joint, and it was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed for him, the same corruption occurred to him in the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came therefore to me, and I attempted to recover that excess with what I placed on the hand from medicines after the purification of his body: and the excess did not push back, and it began to enter into another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called therefore for me to cut into his hand: and I was unwilling to do it, hoping from me for the pushing back of that excess; and I feared also for him regarding death at the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the man's strength was on the decline.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he therefore had given up on me, he returned to his own land: and he came to me about it, because he had hastened, and he cut his entire hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not added this narration, except as an aid regarding that which falls under the type of this illness: and as a signification which is signified, and according to which it is acted.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the treatment of abscesses, and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it makes a collection of pus: then it bursts or is perforated, and there exits what is in it of pus, and the empty place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it like cloth which has already been worn thin: and it does not arrive at the end in its corruption, nor does it press into the bone, nor into the nerve, nor into the ligament: it deserves to be named Sinus: and it is not named Fistula: nevertheless if its space is prolonged until the corruption presses into one of these members, then it is named Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is that you cut the entire wound as it was previously, and especially when it has been subtle and made like a cloth, and you are confident that it will not adhere to the place because of its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will adhere and there is no corruption from that last consequence, and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster, and it is so that you consider regarding the Anus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it is of foul odor: then give a clyster to it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, mixed together in a vessel: and decocted over fire, until the medicine reddens: and comes to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need, and dissolve it with water and honey, and give a clyster to the Anus with it: and constrict the orifice of it, and let the medicine stay in it for the quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression: do this for as many days as until the Anus is cleansed, and the foul smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes give a clyster with water of ashes, when this medicine is not present to you: and it is that you take the ash of vine wood, or the ash of holm oak wood: and throw water upon it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and give a clyster with it, until you are confident that the Anus is now cleaned.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	What if the weak one is not able to tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the water of ashes, then give a clyster with water and honey, in which something has already been mixed from crushed ziniar.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or give a clyster with honey and wine mixed, since it is a property of honey to cleanse and wash: and the wine makes the Anus adhere, especially when there is an excess of dryness and astringency in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do that several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has already been removed: then insert a suppository with what makes flesh grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you take from the plaster dyafinicon, and dissolve it with rose oil and styptic wine, or insert a suppository with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I wrote about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	What if the orifice of the sinus is narrowed, in which the cannula of the clyster does not fit: then widen it with iron for a short time: or put in it a small amount of lichen wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in royal ointment, until it is widened.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also too wide, then bring its lips together with a suture: and reduce from it the quantity in which the clyster can enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice from which the pus runs is elevated upwards: then make an incision in the lower place that is in it, so that the pus runs out from it downwards: for pus when it is confined in the depth of the sinus, prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	What if it is not possible for you to make an incision in the sinus around its lower part according to what you want: then try, that you prepare a membrane with a preparation so that the pus runs out from it with ease according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try, that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take consolidative medicines which are applied to the wound, suitable for what you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such quantity that it makes contact with the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps directly at the orifice of the sinus a hole, slightly larger than the orifice of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread a lenient unguent over another cloth according to the quantity of the wound and put it on the wound in a long shape from the orifice of the sinus, so that the pus can flow out: and do not remove the large cloth unless after some days once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	That one, however, which is over the orifice of the Sinus, is that which you remove every hour, so that what accumulates in it from pus can flow out: and so that you know, whether what flows out from it is a lot, or a little: or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this again consider the location of the Sinus itself, whether the master of it feels pain in it, or if there is not pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or if there is not an abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your medication is thus extended, and you see the matter that flows out over the orifice of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus already adheres, or approximates adherence: then therefore dissolve it on the next morning, or on the third day: and when you dress the wound, then change the cloth to another, and renew the unguent.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If however a subtle pus flows out from the Sinus after a long interval, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, since there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If however undigested pus flows out from the Sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adherence of the Sinus is delayed, and its matter is prolonged: then add to the drying of medicines, true ones made by doctors, so that they are humid in their substance and dry in their virtue: such as the unguentum dyafinicon, when a surplus addition from zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the most extreme of what is cured, it is that you take the ointment called diyafinicon, and dissolve it with rose oil, and spread over it an equal old wine in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now do similar to this action, when the ointment diyafinicon is not present to you, honey, when you have cooked it, until it becomes thick, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind the whole, and pulverize it over the honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then smear over it a cloth, and tie it over the wound: and smear with the honey that you have cooked, until it has thickened: and sprinkle the powder over it, and put over it a cloth, and tie it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when administered to it Aristolochia longa, and the roots of heavenly lily, and it is a lily: and flour of the herb, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or combined, grind them, and sieve them: and sprinkle over the honey that I have mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	What if the matter of the wound is prolonged, and it does not heal with this cure: then know that there is corruption in its depth: or now it makes an impression on the bones, or on the remaining hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the cure for fistulas, according to what has been previously stated.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Of the treatment of a wounded or worn away nail, and the cutting of a toe, and the division.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A panaritium is a tumor that grows under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it grows on the other toes.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When indeed it has prolonged its matter, and the treatment of it is neglected, and it suppurates with a hot tumor: or it becomes rotten, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it rots the whole thing, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the bone, until it is foul smelling: and it makes the end of the toe thick, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you raise your treatment with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not work: then it is necessary to cut with iron all the excess that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cauterization is a strong helper.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If the bone is indeed healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the additions of vacant nail now press the flesh inward, and begin to pierce it, and wound it: then it is necessary that you put a subtle pumice under the angle of the nail which pierces the flesh, and push it upward: and cut that flesh with ease, and put on top of what remains of the flesh from medications burning, corrosive, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If the corruption has already made an impression on the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and extract it: for it will not be healed as long as the corrupted bone remains.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	What if you see corrosion and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to which a reminder of its former state has been preserved.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however nail attrition or a blow occurs, and there is severe pain in it, then it is necessary to perform bloodletting on the weak one first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp razor, a cross-section from above to the root.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful, lest the cut penetrate to the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause severe pain by it on the weak one, and it will be a cause of inflammation of the added flesh in the place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with what calms pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger that is added to the ones that grow on certain hands of men is perhaps entirely fleshy and perhaps there are bones in some of them and perhaps there is a nail in it and some of them grow at the root of the joint or its growth is in certain nodes of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	That one which grows on certain nodes of the finger does not move and that one which grows at the joint of the finger perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	The cutting of that one which is fleshy among them is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which is to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	The treatment of that one whose growth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that one which grows on the finger near the last node, then it is necessary to cut first its flesh with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws that are suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The joining together of fingers which occurs, often happens either from the birth of the man, that is, it grows with him, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from burns of fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is necessary therefore to separate that joining, until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then put between them ligatures or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not join quickly, and separate them, or put between them a subtle sheet of lead, until the place is consolidated according to what is necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if a joining occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then separate that joining according to what prepares and suits the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Of the cutting of defects.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	There are varices, which are swollen veins, full of melancholic superfluities that occur in many parts of the body: and they most often happen in the thighs, especially in the thighs of travelers and laborers.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	It is necessary therefore that you administer a purging of the body from black bile by strong purging many times.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then perform bloodletting on the patient with a basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	Treatment of them indeed is with iron, and it is in two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	The treatment of them is that they should be cut, and black blood is extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the second method is that the vein is evacuated, and everything is extracted.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The cutting of it indeed is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First immerse the thigh in warm water many times, until the thick bloody filth is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the weak thigh from the upper part of its hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then evacuate, that is, extract the blood with your hand from the lower part of the thigh upwards, and it is necessary that you perform bloodletting on the weak one first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the vein until below, until there comes out from the blood a quantity that you see is sufficient, and which the strength of the weak one can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards bind it: and order him to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and prohibit evacuation and bloodletting, when the veins are full, and it harms the weak one.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The evacuation of it is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Scrape the weak thigh, if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then insert it into a bath, or immerse it in its wound with hot water, until it becomes red and the veins become swollen, or let it be exercised with strong exercise, if a bath is not available to it, until the member becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin in the direction of the vein's section along its length, or at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and strip the vein from every side, until it becomes apparent to sensation: and at its appearance, that which you see it turning from redness to blackness declining.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it comes out from the skin, you see it as white as if it were a tendon.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert beneath it a metal rod, until when it is raised and comes out from the skin: suspend it with a blunt hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then cut another section near that section, three fingers apart.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it becomes apparent.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then raise it with rods as you have done, and suspend it with another hook, as you have done at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut another section, or several sections, if you need to.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then raise and cut it at the last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section which is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that until you pull it out from the section which is above, or higher than all the sections, until when it comes out entirely: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you to pull out and raise, then insert a needle with strong thread double, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert beneath it a rod: and move your hand to every part, until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, lest it be cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes difficult for you to heal it, and a defect from it will increase over the weakened part.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have extracted it entirely, then put on the place of the wound a wool cloth soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and treat it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	What if the vein is contracted, having a twisted condition with an involution to the parts, and it is not as we have said according to rectitude: then it is necessary that you find on it at every part of its twist, and the place of its involution.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks, until you elevate it entirely: and beware at your dissection above it lest you fall into the vein, or wound: for it will be difficult for you to elevate, or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Preserve therefore your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The figure of the incision by which the vein is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The figure of the blind hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have curvature like the other hooks, nor is it of sharp extremity, so that it does not wound the vein: and it is of coarse flexibility, gentle: for if it were subtle, it would fall into the vein by its subtlety: indeed let there be superfluous grossness to it, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the saphena vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot climates, such as Alizegi, and the land of Arabia, and in dry, hot lands of little tenderness, that is, in which no herb or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as occur within bodies of snakes and worms, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	The sign of the inception of this vein is a severe inflammation which occurs in the thigh.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place should be warmed.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that warming, as if it were a root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore the extremity of it appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead, the weight of which is one or two drachms, and tie it, and suspend the lead from the thigh.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	As often as anything comes out from it to the outside, wrap that in lead and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	What if it is prolonged a great deal, then cut off a part of it, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at the root until the whole thing has come out.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and returns into the flesh, and causes an abscess to occur, and decay in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Wherefore it is necessary that it be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it comes out from the farthest part of itself, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein come out in certain men what is five palms and ten in length.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has already happened to me that a man came out with it twenty palms long.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If however it is cut during the time of your treatment, then introduce the needle into its opening, and perforate it with a long needle, with a thread, until all that is in it of material comes out: and administer putrefaction of the place with medicines for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the cure for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and there occur to it many openings, and a branch comes out from each opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Heal the wound itself, as we have said in the division, and with what has been prescribed beforehand.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	On the excision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called a cattle disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called among us cattle disease; because it often happens to oxen, and there is a small worm which is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it walks throughout the body, going up and down: and it is shown to sensation while walking from limb to limb, until it breaks out wherever it breaks out on the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the rot of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes happen, that is, intestinal worms, and roundworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its wickedness.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when it walks in the body and rises to the head, and arrives at the place: then perhaps it opens in it, and emerges, and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you want to cure it, and extract it, then it is not done unless by its movement, and the appearance of itself to sensation.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore, that you bind what is above it, and what is below it with a strong constraining bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	Which if it is deep in the flesh, and you do not find it: then apply to the place a cautery with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And what is feared most, is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see it having already arrived at the head near the eye, then bind beneath it the eyebrow with a good tight bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is fitting that the weak person should use purification of their body with medicines that dissolve putrid foul humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods which generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the excision regarding the illness of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This illness is called in our land Nakir, and it is a pain which occurs in certain members, then it moves from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I indeed have already seen it, according to what I relate to you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a weak woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she exposed her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained for one hour, I saw one swelling increase with a gurgling sound, as a worm increases, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it is able to be: so that it is like living silver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain therefore receded from that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it wandered throughout her whole body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed therefore at the swiftness of its change from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I indeed had not seen this illness with my eyes in this manner before.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However I saw many who find the pain changing from member to member, and I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it is, except that it is because the woman was one of those who are from villages of dry bodies and detected veins, hence therefore it appears to the sense that the migratory condition is changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this method in those who are delicate and have moist bodies of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you apply the treatment to it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to your eye, as we have said, then bind above it and below it quickly: and cut above it, until that constricted bloodiness goes out: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with bodily evacuation, and with that which expels bloodiness, and purges them with foul-smelling pills, and pills of serapion, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are differentiated according to their types and according to the places in which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is this: that among them are those which have large and small heads: and are concave, and convex.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are those which have barbs.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are those which have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those indeed which are according to the members in which they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or the members are from the principal hollow members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and their likes.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any one of these members, and the signs of death appear to you, which I will tell you after, then it is necessary that you should desist from extracting that arrow from them, for death follows it in him in whom it is, in most dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For indeed when an arrow falls into the brain and penetrates the skull, and exits through the siphac which is above the brain, it happens that there occur: soda uehemens, and scotomia, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflation, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and mixing up of the intellect, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood exits from the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a white humidity similar to poultice exits from the place of the wound.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there exits from it something similar to the suppuration of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not exit.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left breast: and he feels as if it is fixed in a hard thing, not in a soft thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the motion of a pulse: and black blood runs out from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And it is followed by coldness of the extremities, and a cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death descends without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung, is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels that follow the neck become swollen, and the color of the sick person changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a great, high breath: and he seeks an attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	For if the arrow falls into the membrane that is in the breast: then it is near the small ribs: and there is made a great panting with vehement pain, with sighing: and all the members of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps it will come out of the wound with some undigested food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly and is fixed in it, something of feces will come out of the wound, or a piece of intestine, or gut which is already torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope for its cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	What if an arrow falls into the bladder and urine comes out, and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger above the weakened area: then you should know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder, and arm, and the vertebrae of the back, and the elbows, and the hips, and the legs, and their like, are saved from the members according to many dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery or a nerve: and the arrow is not venomous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen regarding the removal of arrows, so that you may understand by it about your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Which is, that to a certain man an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore extracted it from him from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye below the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not take out of it except a small extremity, with which it adhered to his wooden arrow, and it was a large arrow among the arrows of Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no notches.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and no bad accident happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted an arrowhead from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabian arrow, and is that which has barbs.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I sewed over it between two guidings: and now it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was careful with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man into whom it had fallen in his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After which thirty days passed for him, and nothing was changed regarding his condition, I sewed over the arrow, and I applied a poultice to it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no evil accident happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I treated a man into whom an arrow had fallen in his back, and the wound was consolidated over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After which it was, after seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I treated a woman into whom an arrow fell in her belly, and the wound was consolidated over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and nothing was changed regarding her condition, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I treated another man, into whom an arrow fell in his face: and the wound was consolidated, and it remained, not finding much pain for him: and many things similar to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from one of the King's princes, which had fallen into him in the middle of his nose, and already it had declined to the right side a little: and the whole arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was called therefore to his treatment after the accident of the arrow, for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the wound of the arrow constricted strongly.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I searched for it with a subtle probe, and I did not feel it: and he himself felt a puncture and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	The spear was removed, which was that puncture from the extremity of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I applied a plaster to the place with a plaster in which there was an attractive and digestive virtue, trusting with me that it would bring forth the place to a head and the sign of the arrow would appear to me, so I could cut above it: and no accident happened in the place indicating that the arrow had struck the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I treated it diligently with a plaster over it for many days: and no accident occurred, and the wound was consolidated meanwhile: and he remained weak from the extraction of that space for some days, until he felt the arrow on a certain day inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me about it.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I applied therefore a sharp medicine, corroding for many days, until it was opened: and when I probed I probed it, and I felt the extremity of the arrow subtle which adhered to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound through that sharp medicine, until the extremity of the arrow appeared visibly to us: and a space of time passed for me with it for about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound had been enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not obey to come out: then I did not cease to contrive, and devise over it with methods of devices, until I began on it on a certain day with well-made forceps, according to which the shape of them will be found at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And doctors indeed judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I restored it therefore, and the wound was consolidated, and the weak one was healed with complete health: and nothing harmed him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you the quality of extracting certain arrows: so that you put that rule and meaning on that which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with narration: nor does the book comprehend it, and the skillful artisan compares a little with much: and with what is present, with that which is absent: and he finds a new operation, and a new instrument according to the descent of extraneous things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not come out of the members in which they are fixed, except according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by traction from the place into which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite part of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered, is an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place: and is drawn, and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	For if it does not obey to exit at the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it for some days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its attraction will be alleviated, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in a bone, and does not obey you to exit, then leave it also for some days: and move it with attraction and motion every day, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	For if it does not obey you to exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone on every side with a subtle drill, until the arrows are freed.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it out, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already proceeded into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those accidents which I mentioned appear from below: then abstain from drawing out the arrow, and leave it, until its inflammation subsides after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	If an arrow penetrates to the spleen, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, unless it is in the body to the extent of a bone, and does not penetrate up to the spleen: and he remains weak for some days, and none of those accidents happen to him: then devices are used for attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If the arrow is fixed deeply, and does not yield to attraction: then administer a drill in the vicinity of the arrow, as I have told you: then treat the area until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If the arrow is already hidden in a location of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sensation: then investigate it with probing.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then attract it with certain instruments that are suited to its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot reach it, on account of the constriction of the wound, and on account of the length of the arrow in the depth: and there is not a bone, nor a nerve, nor a vein: then probe above it, until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	What if there are to him nerves that hold it, then free the flesh fixed in them on all sides, with every device that you can, and devices, if it cannot overcome the swelling of the flesh in the fracture of the ears, and their distortion, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use distortion of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you make it come out: and proceed with ultimate subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its attraction and extraction become difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	What if you cannot overcome it in one hour, then leave it for some days, until what are around it putrefy.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: for the tunic will be loosened, if indeed a contrary condition makes for you an efflux of blood, then administer what we said concerning treatment in its own chapter: and preserve your strength from the incision of a vein, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer the arrow's extraction in every way that is possible for you, and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have narrated to you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is fitting, that you do when you draw out the arrow, that the weak part be according to the figure, according to which it was in the case of the arrow itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is a greater assistance.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If however it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow which comes out from the opposite part of another, or already proceeds from it something to the exterior: or makes a gibbosity of the extremity of the arrow by sensation from the upper part of the adjacent skin, and you see it prominent: make an incision over it, and let the incision be according to the quantity that the forceps can grasp in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it out: for it becomes easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If indeed it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until the arrow impresses itself in the bone, and enlarges itself: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for some days: then repeat it, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	What if the wood of the arrow is in it, then push it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however the wood has fallen, and you want to administer a push: then introduce to it a hollow instrument, so that its hollow enters into the tail of the arrow: then push it with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If however the arrow head is barbed then push it out with an instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is indeed pulled out through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	What if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary, that the barbed flesh, in which is the venom, be cut out: if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what is suitable for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	What if the arrow falls in the breast, or in the stomach, or in the bladder, or in the side: and is near to that which you touch with your finger, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting the vein, or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then sew the wound, if you see it, and treat it, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let there be similar extremities like a bird's beak, which are made like iron: when they grasp above the arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many types are made from them, large and small and medium, according to the quantity of the size of the arrow, and its thinness, and the width of the wound, and its constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of a pusher for barbed things.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of a pusher for pointed things.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the extremity of the rod, like a radius, so that its entrance is pulled out from the barbed arrow, and it is pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of this pusher for the barbed thing is barbed like a bird's feather, so that the entrance of the arrow is pulled out into it and its thrust.

Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Since a vein does not appear to sensation there, and because blood begins to flow at once.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary that you withdraw your hand with the bloodletting instrument for a short time: and make the blood flow according to your necessity.

Sanatur enim uulnus.	For the wound will be healed.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	Of the bloodletting of the veins according to Algeberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	The instrument of Algeberich's bloodletting of the veins is because it helps against bad breath in the mouth, and corruption of the gums: and bad ulcers: and cracks of the lips, and bad ulcers, also those which are in the nose, and in its surroundings.

Then uncover the lip of it, and look at the two veins: one of which is to the right of the lip, and the second to the left of it: and the demonstration of both is through the blackness of the gums.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And that vein is because around the edges of them there are small, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Cut therefore both with an incision of the falling.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If however there is doubt about you, and you do not know which of them it is: then proceed to the cutting of the larger one, and its more manifest.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And do likewise concerning the two veins which are in the upper lip: and mostly custom runs with it: and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Of bloodletting of the vein under the tongue after the bloodletting of the head.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	The aid of the two veins which are under the tongue for bloodletting is, that the bloodletting of the head is for the afflictions which are in the throat, and the sickness of the uvula, and the sicknesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of bloodletting them is that the weak should sit between your hands before you in the sun: and raise their tongue, and look under the tongue on one side a vein, and on the other side a vein: and the color of both declines to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Bloodlet therefore both: and beware, lest you wound your hand in bloodletting them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under them are arteries, and perhaps it happens that there is a flow of blood from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Of the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins which are bloodlet in the elbow, are where bloodletting custom runs in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And bloodletting of the ears is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a broad myrtle-shaped lancet, or with an olive-shaped one for subtlety, or by cutting with a knife-shaped lancet, and it is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is what suits for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are broad and subtle types according to the width of the veins and their tightness The form of the myrtle-shaped lancet is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it suits for opening hollow veins, full ones, protruding ones, visible ones, thick ones, and those which contain coarse, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this lancet is of lesser breadth, and of more subtle extremity.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it suits for bloodletting of subtle veins, which contain subtle yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On the bloodletting of royalty.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The royal vein, which is one of these three veins for bloodletting, is a privilege.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	For it extracts blood from illnesses which are under the throat and neck, following the chest and stomach: and it suits the bloodletter to bloodlet with it, so that he may beware, and be above fear of it, for beneath it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs, and adds to the prick of the lancet, he will cut that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Wherefore it is necessary that the bloodletter does not bloodlet with the lancet, but rather cuts with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	Which if it does not appear with a clear royal appearance, then it is necessary that you displace it, and change to another, or seek some branch of it: or in place of the bloodletting, use a ligature on the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	It itself is obvious, and cut it with a lancet, Anesil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you perform phlebotomy on the same, then it is necessary before the tightening of the arm, so that you touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark on the place with a cauterizing agent, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave section using a lancet, Alnesil, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware that the blow does not fall through the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, as you tie the ligature, an inflation in the place that you marked with a cauterizing agent, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: avoid it therefore.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	For if you see blood in phlebotomy jumping, like the urine of a child, and it is subtle, red blood: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then press closely, and put your finger on it over a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If the blood is then cut off (for it is often cut off), then tie the arm, and let it be: and let the weak one beware of its motion: and let him be above its fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for some days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood does not stop, and overcomes you: and your medicine is not present at the moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For the extremities of it contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Take the bark of a plant, and bind it: take one half, and tie it over the place of the vein with a proper tightening, with a ligature and poultices until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then the cure itself with that which preceded it, a remembrance of the place of powders for cutting off the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, on account of the smallness of the place of the wound, and the possibility of binding from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Of the bloodletting of the dark vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The bloodletting of the dark vein is a remedy, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because it is composed of the branch of the Royal and the branch of the Head, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is suitable for the bloodletter to be cautious with it, that he should be above fear from its bloodletting, for beneath it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds to the puncture of the bloodletting and finds the nerve, there occurs in it numbness, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it will not be completely healed.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If however it is hidden in some men, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then it is necessary that you place your bloodletting where you will bloodlet with a cut with Alnesil, and divert the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	Which if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Of the vein of the head.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The bloodletting of the vein of the head is a remedy, because it attracts blood from the head and applies to diseases of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish, that you bloodlet it by pricking with an olive bloodletter, or with a myrtle bloodletter: because it is the savior of all veins, because there is not beneath it an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	The vein that suits you for bloodletting is the one where you find the head of the elbow, and you look for a thinner spot: and it does not harm if it is not found with the first puncture, so that it is repeated over it several times with the bloodletting instrument.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However a vein perhaps forms an abscess in some men when it is not bloodletted at the first puncture, but that abscess does not harm it in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of Bloodletting, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of the bloodletting however, and its accidents that arise from it, are things in which you should consider correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First therefore it is that which you ought to know, that bloodletting is not administered except in the conservation of health and its preservation and caution against the approach of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that bloodletting is done on one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Fusca, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that bloodletting is done at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in summer, and autumn, and winter after digestion, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And bloodletting is done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Bloodletting which is administered in diseases does not have a determined hour, but when convenience and necessity provoke it, at night or day, and every hour, and every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not suitable for children to be bloodletted until fourteen years are upon them.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bloodletted, except from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should old men be bloodletted, who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When someone wants to undergo bloodletting for any condition, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines before bloodletting with a mild enema, if there is a lot of retained feces in them, so that the veins do not attract putrid and harmful superfluities from the intestines during bloodletting to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should bloodletting be performed on a patient who is vomiting, that is, with nausea, nor one who is drunk or vomiting from intoxication, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor one who is weak with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And bloodletting should be avoided again after a colic passion, and vomiting, and flux of the belly, and frequent intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and anything that dissolves virtue from the bodily or animal substance.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines, if it is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him take a bath, if nothing prevents it, or let him be exercised with some exercise, so that the blood is made subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place bloodletting on his chest, around the third hour of the day, as we have said: and take care, that his chest is evacuated that day from all bad animal accidents, such as anxiety, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and punishment, and excessive evacuations, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him have present things with which usage has created a habit in men from aromatics, and perfumes, and incense and similar things to the quantity of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the one performing bloodletting sit on a cushion, which is higher than the cushion of the one undergoing bloodletting: afterwards let him draw out his arm, and rub it with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he should tie the ligature with a bandage, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And the tightening should be moderate, because when the tightening is uneven, or excessive, it prevents the flow of blood; and similarly in leniency, it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the tightening it is necessary that the one performing the bloodletting should rub his hands together until the veins become swollen and declare themselves to the sensation.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the one performing the bloodletting should wipe the vein with a little old oil, properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his index finger of the left hand on the vein under the spot where he wants to perform the bloodletting, so that the vein does not flee and the puncture is made.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For the vein is like a fleeing string when it comes to bloodletting: and of them there are those which are full of wind: and when you place the lancet on it, it contracts under the lancet, and the one performing the bloodletting is deceived, and the vein does not open: and if it does open, it is constricted: therefore it is necessary that the one performing the bloodletting should be steady, and be careful in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should apply the lancet.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then the vein is opened from one side, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then he should try the other side under that same spot a little, or above it with speed, if the spot is not damaged.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	What if the spot becomes inflamed, or becomes weak, then let it be for a day, or two days: and do not tie the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps the warm poultice will attract the inflammation.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And let him not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he should repeat the bloodletting if it is loved.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	What if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and it happens that the amount does not come out of the blood as the force: then insert the lancet in the same opening according to the straightness, and add a little in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do that with speed, before the part becomes inflamed, for an inflamed part is in many men near a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see it already inflamed, then do not go over it at all, for it does not excuse anything with regard to you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put on it something from the dregs of oil: since it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your bloodletting, which you perform on veins to prohibit the flow of blood: and they call it tyrical alfarach, and sagzenea, when it is put from one of them on the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is refined and resolved, when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	What if there happens a great inflammation in the place of bloodletting, for it often happens, especially to him who is not accustomed to bloodletting except by chance, or is the opening of the vein small, then hasten and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little: and bind it for one hour: since it loosens.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do that after the blood has come out from the same vein, when its flow is complete, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	What if there remains in the place after days something blackish or greenish, it does not harm: and if you want, put on it something of aloes, or a solution of myrrh: or something from the juice of mint, that is, calament or something similar.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And many times there occur apostems and enlargements with phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore put your hand on it, then if you find softness with compression of it, then that enlargement is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Beware therefore, that you put on it something of what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood flows from the arterial vessel.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place is hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you extract from every man blood according to the quantity of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the color conquering over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it exit, until it becomes red: and similarly if you see it thick: then let it exit, until it becomes subtle: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs extraction of blood twice, that the phlebotomy of the vein be amplified, and the phlebotomist be warned: and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he extract it in the veins, and that the opening be narrow: and better that which is administered in phlebotomy of the vein, is that it be a cross-section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it is accustomed to faint at phlebotomy of the syncopis, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy moderate bread infused in water of pomegranate or secaniabin, if it is warmed: and extract from him blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if it is of a cold complexion, then let it receive before phlebotomy bread soaked in juice of myrrh or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or in syrup aromatized with fragrant odors.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	What if it happens to faint at phlebotomy, and the cause of this is the exit of much blood: then it should take in drink water of flesh, and subtle fragrant syrup: and make use of aromatics with gum, and let its chest be bound with it: and make use of the remainder which we said in the division on the chapter of fainting from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to evacuate his arm and release his blood a second time: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is because of much evacuation, and the virtue of which is weak, that he release blood little by little according to the quantity of virtue in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever indeed wishes to evacuate his arm and release his blood a second time, and his body is strong: then let him do that after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body from the opposite part to which it inclines: it is necessary that he be evacuated on the second day, or on the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and it causes fever to happen: it is necessary that blood go out from it at once, and a large quantity be extracted from it: and the opening be enlarged until fainting happens: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy: and that you put your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not happen in place of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For it often happens, when the phlebotomy practitioner is ignorant, and negligence occurs.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when the vein has been opened to release the arm and release blood a second time, since the opening of the vein has already been closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, so that it is pressed upon with force, and the curved [needle] is extended quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a malignant ulcer, or it diminishes itself, until it is blooded a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Remove it with the sharpness of bloodletting that which has coagulated from blood in the opening of the vein, and put upon it something of salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put upon it something from theriac of Alfaroch, or Sagzenea, and apply to it a gentle compression, until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If then the vein is an apostema, leave it, and do not touch it, until the apostema subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	What if necessity demands to release the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either bloodlet it above that place, or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The veins of the arm are bloodlet at the place of the Fuscus and the Basilicus, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of its bloodletting is, that the weak hand is inserted into hot water, until it becomes red and the vein appears manifestly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then let it be bound above it with a ligature of moderate constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then bloodlet across a little at a time, not in width, nor in length: and let the opening be wide, and your bloodletting be that which you bloodlet upon the joint of the hand for a short while.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	What if the exit of blood is forbidden, then put the hand again in hot water, and let the blood flow into the water, until you obtain your necessity.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from putting the hand again in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And the flow of blood into hot water is used a lot in the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the bloodletting of this vein is a savior to all veins, because there is not under it a pulsating vein, nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Venesection of the right hand is conducive to ailments of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its venesection is that you bind the veins of the hand with a ligature, or with your hand, after you have inserted it in warm water until the vein becomes inflamed and is demonstrated to sensation strongly.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then venesect the vein by making a cross incision.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm it in anything.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And beware, lest you venesect your own hand.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For under it are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then put the hand in warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat it in warm water, the blood congeals in the opening of the vein, and is prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you have extracted the amount of blood necessary, then put oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not close quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly it is necessary to do with every constricted branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The remedy of venesection on the left hand is: because it is conducive to ailments of the spleen: and do similarly in its venesection as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The remedy of venesection of the saphena vein is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the uterus, and retention of menses, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and thighs, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of its venesection is that the weak person inserts their foot into warm water: and makes friction on it until the veins become swollen: and binds above the joint of the foot with a ligature.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the place of the vein is near the heel, visible towards the thumb: and many branches ramify from it on the sole of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Bloodletting is performed on the larger branch of it, or at the heel in its connection, because it is better and more beneficial for health.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	What if bloodletting is performed on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are under it above the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And put your bloodletting where you perform it from a transverse position, as if you wish to cut it, and let the bloodletter be Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If the flow of blood is stopped, then immerse the foot in warm water, and let the blood flow into it, until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	What if the bloodletter misses the vein at first, then repeat the bloodletting towards the upper parts for a little while, for the place is safe, and you will not get harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel on the wooded side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the indication for bloodletting of it is, for pain of the hip, when it is due to warm blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its bloodletting is, that the weak enter the bath and be bound, and let the leg be constricted on the side of the hip up to above the heel four fingers, with a thin long bandage, for it does not appear except because of this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then perform bloodletting according to whatever method is possible for you, or according to a crosswise position, and it is better, either that you cut it with an incision, or that you cut it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safe, and it is hidden in many men to a great extent.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	What if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all, then perform bloodletting on some branch of it, and it is that which appears on the back of the foot, and opposite the ear, and beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow in quantity as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the tightening, and put a piece of leather over the place of bloodletting, and constrict the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it will heal quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Of Purging, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Clysters are made from horns, and from copper, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And Purging is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification, and the extraction of blood: and the other is purging without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this Purgation which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the purgings that are administered with scarification and the extraction of blood, are in fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the purging of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and the purgings of Alhagdahim, and they are two sides of the neck from both parts together: and the purgings of the jaw, and it is under the jaw in the lower mouth: and the purgings of the two shoulders: and the purgings of Alachosos above the end of the tail: and the purgings of the two armpits, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and the purgings of the two thighs: and the purgings of the two hams.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And this Purgation does not extract blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that, virtue does not come out from them, as is the case with bloodletting.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it necessary to administer purging, either with fire or without fire, in any of the illnesses that occur from overfilling, until the whole body is emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	What if necessity calls for Purgation from illness, or because of habit, we administer it at every hour, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	What is it, that which is from humans who when the blood in them multiplies to the point that it requires extraction through venesection, finds in its head a heaviness and swooning.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And there is from them one who finds fullness and redness in his face, his head, and his neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And there is from them one who finds itching in his face and his forehead, and darkness and dimness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And there is from them one who scratches the place of his venesection.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And there is from them one whose sneezing is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And there is from them one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or it collects on his tongue and he spits up blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And there is from them one whose sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And there is from them one who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things that are similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see any of these things, and it is properly so in the third day of the month: we then order venesection to be done, after two or three hours have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The juice of the Venesection of the nut, is: because it brings about heaviness in the head, and that which flows to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But indeed it should be that it is after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this Venesection is in place of the phlebotomy of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted that one who is of a cold complexion, or in whom there is a catarrh, should use it.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings to them great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that it is not fitting that the old use it, and those in whose head there are cold agues.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	He who does it frequently over it, is overcome by forgetfulness.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And because of that, it is necessary to instruct the one performing the surgery, that he should put his hand with the cannula for a short time towards the lower parts, fearing the generation of an obstruction.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosatio or Alkehel is in place of phlebotomy of the spleen and phlebotomy of Basilic, and because of that it treats asthma and constriction of breathing and fissure of the instrument of breathing and coughing and replenishment.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the cannula of Alkehel be pushed in for a short time, because if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosatio indeed is a treatment for accidental pains in the head, and diseases of the eyes, and migraines, and perforations, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in place of phlebotomy of Basilic.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary to instruct the one performing the surgery, that he should not press his hand with the incision: so that he does not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Ventosatio under the chin treats ulcers in the mouth and corruption of the gums and similar things from diseases which are in the mouth: and it is in place of phlebotomy of the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Ventosatio of the spatula treats the alchafacham, which is caused by retention and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Ventosatio indeed of the interior parts of the two armpits treats the place of phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilic, and Splenic, and Cephalic: because it itself draws blood from all those tiny little veins which are in the flesh: and those tiny little veins draw from other thicker ones until the drawing reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary to instruct the one performing the surgery, that he should not proceed far in the incision: because the area is bare of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	A vein that is cauterized on the alchausos constricts hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary to warn the cauterizer that the cautery should be large and made of copper: because the location requires strong suction and subtle cauterizations are likely to break.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Cauteries of the hips diminish with obvious reduction: because they attract blood from the whole body and increase old pains in the kidneys, bladder, and uterus: they provoke menstruation, and cause bothor and ademenul: and they take the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope to occur in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of cauterizing the alhorcobene is similar to the benefit of cauterizing both hips.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of cauterizations is that you should place a cautery in a vacant space, and apply moderate suction: and do not prolong the application of cauterizations, but rather put them on quickly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the area equally: and do not cease to repeat and continue this, until you see the area already red and inflamed, and an appearance of blood appears: then scarify, and repeat the suction little by little.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who is of tender flesh and rare pores among men, it is necessary to scarify him only once, not more: so that the location does not become ulcers.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the cauterizer to enlarge the scarification, and make it a little deeper: and moderate the suction with facility, velocity, and his own movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	For if there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In this case, what is first considered is the subtlety of the blood and its thinness, and secondly the scrutiny of the exact extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is very foul, then let there be a third incision, so that it attains the ultimate.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we want to extract blood gradually, or for a short time, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	What if we want the extraction of much blood, we make many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that there be a deep incision: and the limit of equality in the incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What should be administered from oils at the application of poultices, and what the poultice itself will absorb.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case in which the skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are constricted, it is necessary that the places of the poultice be anointed with opening, softening, resolving oils: if it is in the summer season, such as is oil of almonds, or oil of violet, or oil of sweet almond, or oil of gourd seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the winter season, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or sabbatical oil: and their similars.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If the surplus is thick and cold, then let the oil be bitter, or oil of balsam, or oil of albene, or oil of anetina: and their similars.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If the poultice is of large pores, of tender flesh: then it is necessary that it be prohibited from oil, and it is necessary that these places of the poultice be washed after the poulticing with rose water, or with cold water, or with solative water, or with gourd water, or with purslane water: and their similars.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of much humidity, should wash the vents with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and sumach: and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whose superfluities are gross, should wash his vents with old wine, or with water of samsuc, or decoction of anet, or camomile: and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is fitting that the ventization should be done in a bath, or in a dresssed chamber of a bath, and it is necessary that it should be administered after exiting the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not fitting that anyone should sleep after ventization.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that one should be governed by, either the one to be purged or the bloodletter before purging.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that it is fitting that you consider first: then if the one to be purged or the bloodletter is choleric, and his blood is acute with inflammation: then it is necessary that he receive cooling things, such as cold granules: and also an enema with vinegar and lettuce, and secancabin, and iuleb: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And let his food be soft-boiled, and the flesh of boiled eggs, and seasoned foods with verjuice: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in a drink syrup of honey, or of almond, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let him take fragrant wine moderate, which is between old and new: and let him be prescribed to use food in small quantity.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And let his food be soft-boiled, and cabbage: and pease, that is, small birds: and boiled or cooked meat of pigeons.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of purging and bloodletting be more than the food: and it is necessary that there be given in a drink to certain men at the third hour alfaroch, or medicine from musk, that is, muscat, or alesselithe before purging: and before bloodletting, or after: so that the principal members be comforted, and the blood be refined.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not suitable for them to take it in a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On inflammation of the blood vessels without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Inflammations of the blood vessels which are without scarification, are those that are applied to the liver, and spleen, and gout, and on the navel, and umbilicus, and the region of the kidneys, and the hump of the ankle: because these members do not suffer scarification upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought through them, unless there is an attraction of blood from one member to another member: as we apply a plaster on the breasts in the disease of flowing nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to resolve a cold and viscous inflammation from a member to another member: as we apply a plaster on the abdomen, and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it rarefies the member, and heats it, and removes the pain for this reason, because it resolves that inflammation.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	And it is also applied on the kidneys, when there occurs in them a blockage or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by virtue of its attractive power it perhaps opens up the blockage, or eradicates the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it does when it is applied on the liver and spleen for a third type of inflammation in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these plasters should be administered with the juice alone, without cutting.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water for diseases of the pleura: and that is, so that the plaster may be filled, and be large, with hot water alone, or water in which herbs that are suitable have been decocted.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of a plaster administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two fingers, according to which we form it: and its quantity in depth be half a palm: and let there be on its edge, in the place which is around the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity that the needle enters: let it be made from bronze or citrus, with thick, smooth, equal, polished edges: so that it does not harm the member at its application upon it: and let there be in its middle a transverse rod of bronze or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this large spongy vein is made, greater than we have described, and a little less, according to the illnesses and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the spongy veins of children and thin people are different from those of men and fat bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this spongy vein with fire on a membrane is to light a linen thread with fire from a candle or a small wax taper and place it above the middle of the rod that is across in the middle of the spongy vein, so that the fire is lit around the lower part of the spongy vein, so that the body of the weak person does not get burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it should be placed on the membrane, and the finger should be above the opening that I mentioned, until when we hold the spongy vein: while we press, we remove the finger, and vapor will exit above that opening, and the spongy vein will dissolve immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light a thread according to its measure and apply it, if you press on it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the spongy vein that is administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no cross rod nor opening: and it is not administered except that it may fill with water and is placed on the membrane only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger this spongy vein is, so that it may hold much water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Of the hanging of bloodletting cups.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodletting cups are not administered on many parts, except on those members where it is not possible to place spongy veins, because of their smallness, such as the lip and gums, and similar things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a member bare of flesh, such as the finger and nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that they are taken from bloodletting cups which are in sweet waters, clean from impurities.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be immersed day and night in fresh water, until they are softened, and nothing remains in their stomach.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be treated at first with bloodletting, and with applications to the abdomen.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the weak member should be cleaned, until it becomes red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards they will be placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they fill and fall, and it is possible to suck the place with an application, then it is most useful for healing: and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and rubbed, and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	What if the flow of blood is prolonged after a fall of blood vessels, and it is that which is flowing back: then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and put it on top, until the flowing back is stopped.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if the blood increases, then powder over it with a powdered zeolite, or gall, and similar things from astringents: until the blood is stopped.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they will be placed on the place, crushed broad beans, and left until the beans stick to the spot, for the blood is stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if a repetition of bleeding is needed, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If however the blood vessels are forbidden from suspension, then the place will be cleaned with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or a needle is thrust into the places, until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they will be placed, for as soon as they feel something from the blood, they stick at once.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When they are used so that they fall, powder over them with something from powdered aloe, or salt, or ash: and they will fall at once.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	The end of the second part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	The general speech is about restoration, and dislocation, and cure of twisting, and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also many times necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures, and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O sons, that the foolish among the physicians and the common people throw themselves into this chapter, stupidly, and who have never inspected the book of the ancients, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it happens that this method is deprived of the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I did not find anything good in it at all, and I would not have attained what I attained except for the length of reading the books of the ancients, and study above understanding them, until I extracted the knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experimentation and study throughout the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from it in this Chapter all that my science contains: and on which my experimentation has passed, after I had abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of length, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation, and shown it at the end of declination: and formed in it many forms of the forms of instruments which are administered in it, since it is from the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	The total and collections from the being of fractures of bones, from those in which a preceding knowledge is necessary, before we begin the remembrance of broken members, and diverse ones, if each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is fitting that we say in the prologue of this Chapter, the sums of speech, and chapters, to whose understanding is compelled at first the artisan to stand on the truth of it: namely that you, and who are prepared, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or fall happens to someone, then it is proper first to perform bloodletting on him and to administer a purging treatment, or both at the same time, if nothing prevents it, such as lack of strength, or if he is one of those persons who has a condition in childhood, or an old decrepit person, or if it is a time of intense heat or intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be content with his food being cool, and with fowl that is chilled, and with birds' meat, and with fish: and he should prohibit wine, and fatty meats, and filling foods and every food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until he is safe from the hot abscess, and does not bring about an outflow of matter to the member: then the weak person should return to his first regime with which the habit of his body was running.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When, therefore, the fractured bone begins to be restored, then it is proper that the weak person should be fed with nutritious foods of much nourishment, thick, heavy, in which there is viscosity: such as dishes made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and cabbage, and feet and innards and livers of beasts, and eggs, and fresh fish: and rough wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regime the clotting of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in persons who are in early old age and decrepit, it is not possible that they should knit together and consolidate according to their nature always, on account of the dryness of their membranes: and they do consolidate and knit together which ones of them are at the end of tenderness, such as bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature attaches to the fractured bone from every part something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds itself, until they knit together and bind together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until something does not hinder its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you put nourishing food on the weak person, in which there are thickness, viscosity, and grossness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you should know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the members, since a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone, and similarly all the remaining members are differently joined, and I came with remembrance of every type of fracture exhibited in its distinct Chapter, separate from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the types of fractures of bones are diverse even within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Since there occurs a fracture of it that is curved, besides what happens to it in terms of dislocations.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes there occurs a fracture of it along the length of the bone, and there are fractures of it that are displaced, that is, dislocations, and additions that proceed, as they are in a reed, when it is adapted to a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding, and there is a fracture with a wound and a disruption in the head, and there is a small splitting fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every type has a device, or its own proper instrument for restoration, according to which comes the remembrance of it, distinct in its own places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that which the fracture of the bone is recognized, is its twisting, and its own protrusion, and the appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is not a visible twisting in the place, nor a sound upon touch with your hand when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the weak one find great pain, then there is no fracture there, but it is possible that there is a twisting or a small split, and therefore it is not necessary to move it with the hand and compression at all, but rather put on top of it from the medicines, whose remembrance came after the moment that which suits the place, then let it be bound with a subtle bandage.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should know that the place when it is curved and split into two, besides what dislocations happen to it, nevertheless every part is moved from its comparison, then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to rectify it, equalizing it before a hot abscess happens to it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If a hot abscess happens to him, then leave it for some days, until the abscess subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then treat it equally according to whatever method is possible from gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it and its equalization is easier than the bones, in which there occur displacements.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to what the memory of it suggests to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are displacements in the bone, then extension of this broken member is necessary from two parts, if it is the hand or foot: or with your hand, if it is a small member: or with two cords, or with a cord and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your positioning be where you place the member on an equal spot, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try, that you make those additions return with all skill, and according to whatever method you can in their places: and beware according to your strength, lest pain or injury happen to the weak one through your operation: and try according to your strength, that you apply one of the two bones with its companion, according to the better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time, that you feel and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and equalize it according to the quantity of your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware violent extension and strong compression, as many foolish ones do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For they often cause a hot abscess to happen through their operation, or contraction in the member: as we have already seen that from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then connect after equalization, and decent operation, and the binding of that member, and quiet, and tranquility: and warn the weak one concerning it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And let it rest, so that it does not move during its hours of watchfulness, and its sleep according to its revolution, and its agitation, and at its evacuation, and all its movements by its final strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And let it rest, so that the position of the limb is not a position in which pain follows.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Which is, that when it feels pain or a lesion in the disposition of the limb's position, then it is necessary to change it to another disposition from the one with which it does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And let it rest with that, so that its position is equal and straight, so that no twisting occurs in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fracture of the broken limb is according to which I will describe.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured limbs are differentiated in their smallness and largeness, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Those therefore which are small among them, such as the arm, and finger, and elbow, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those however which are thick among them, such as the hip and leg, it is necessary that there be on them a wrapping of broad, strong cloth.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	For a wide bandage connects the large limb and binds it from every side with equal tension, so that it does not press upon it unevenly.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then after your dressing, put on a plaster suitable to it, over the linen cloth, on the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap a bandage over the place of the fracture itself with three or four wraps, according to what the limb deserves, and tighten your hand for a short time with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go up to the upper part from the place of the fracture, and tighten less than your previous tension, with which you tightened the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with an involution from the place of the fracture for a short time, and gradually soften the stiffness, until you take a large thing from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another poultice, and involution it again over the fractured place with involutions.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards dress with an involution to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be on the tightening of the involution and its softening, according to what we said in the first involution above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the involutions a dressing of linen or cloth, with which the crookedness of the fracture is straightened, if there is crookedness in it: and if not, you do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then involution another poultice over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards place equal to these involutions stars made from plaster immediately, if there is not in the place inflammation, nor hot aposteme.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is however in it inflammation or an aposteme, then put on it what settles that aposteme and takes away the inflammation: and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind over it then the plasters.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the plasters be from the middle of a split cane, shaved, wisely formed: or let them be from wood from which cribs are made, which are made from pine or gerah, that is, palm branches, or calingi: and let the width of all plasters be according to this form, and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	Truly it is necessary, that the plaster which is put over the fracture be thicker and wider for a while, than the other plasters: and the length of the plaster be according to what is suitable for the member from its size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind over the plasters with another poultice, according to the first tightening, the same.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind from above with twisted threads, according to what we have said concerning the bandage: and it is, that your bandage should be above the place of the fracture by more: and the more it is elongated from the fracture, the less the bandage.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is fitting, that the threads should be moderate in thickness and fineness, and should be made from soft flax.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, such as I have seen from the work of foolish surgeons placing their threads made from twisted flax cords, it is a great mistake: for the bandage falls with them beyond the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And very fine threads are also not suitable: for you will not achieve through the bandage with them that which you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not fitting, that there should be between one star and another less than a finger.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	What if a weak person is injured by the ends of the stars after the bandage on healthy places: then put under them from soft lint or woolen cloth, until nothing is injured from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and a disruption occurs in the skin, I will discuss it with consideration of its specifics in the second chapter.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken member needs to be tied with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	Which is, that when a member is large, it is not fitting to put stars on it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the event of a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters, with which the ancients restored, which are put on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The method of a common plaster abbreviated, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially for women and children: since it is from that which neither heat nor cold overcomes.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, that you take from the dust of the millstone, and it is the inner part of the flour which hangs in the sides of the millstone near the motion of the mill: and knead it as it is, except that you sift it with the whites of an egg: and put its confection not thick, nor fine.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of plaster for restoring a fracture and a dislocation and a twist.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take mess, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugath, and juice of all in equal amount X myrrh, and aloes of each an equal amount V, and alethil XX, let all be pounded, and sifted, and mixed with water of alethil: or with the white of an egg, if the application to the weak person is warmed.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and confirms many men.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plaster, which also confirms fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugath, and mess, and white alteae, of all in equal amount X myrrh, and aloes of each an equal amount V acacia VI, and boli armeni XX, let all be pounded with much rubbing, and sifted, and mixed with water, or the white of an egg: and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Another method of plaster for joints, and bones separated from their places: and it calms the accidental pain to them, and the division of bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Let a woolen cloth be dipped, and submerged in vinegar, and oil cooked, and put on the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is not a virtue of restoration, but it is good for calming hot abscesses: and it drives out pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Another method of plaster, which restores the broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of the fig tree, and the leaves of the papaver of the forest: and pound all, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Another method of short plaster, administered for the restoration of a fracture of bone: and when you use it for the resolution of the remainder of an abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of marshmallow and chamomile and flowers of violets and powder of herb, all in one portion: let them all be ground and mixed with wine, if the member is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If the member is heated, then mix it with water of moist coriander or with water and apply it thereto.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of a stronger plaster for resolution than this first one, when there occurs a hard aposteme during the restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take the root of marshmallow and seed of flax, and pomegranate, and melilot, and samsuch, and flowers of violets and chamomile, all in one portion: let them all be ground and mixed with willow water, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All that according to the heat of the member, and the quietness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that anything should be applied on a fractured member for its restoration, except a cerate made from wax and oil: none other: and he said it is a mean between grossness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	To Galen however it seemed, that things which have an exciting of heat, such as myrrh and aloe and frankincense, and the like, should be applied on a fractured member for its restoration.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	A method of plaster that relieves lesion and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugwort and cress and cut human hair or bird's feathers and marshmallow and salt in equal parts: let them be ground and sifted and mixed: and make from it a plaster.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity however according to which it is necessary that the bandage remains, then is solved, is that you consider then, if there does not occur weakness or pain, nor itching, nor is the fractured bone moved from its place: then do not resolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it happens to him in the place a severe itching, or an annoying pain, or a swelling: then apply and dissolve it at that hour, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a soft marine sponge, moist: and submerge it in warm water, and wash the spot with it, until the itching calms, and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put on it a piece of cloth soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it over the place for one night, until you are secure from a hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat it to a subtle tightening, and a small plaster: and do not bind it with your first constriction, but subtly, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, and redness, and pain, and swelling, and all the accidents have been entirely removed, and you apply plaster and binding, then repeat it as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing happens to the limb from those things that we have said, then do not dissolve it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is left for twenty days, all that according to what appears to you from the solution of the limb, as we have said, until when the fracture adheres, and the coagulation of the flesh approaches over it: then add also at that time in the binding more than your entire first binding: and also add in the nourishment of the weak body, according to what the previous recollection of it was.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see the place of the fracture already becoming dry and thin more than it should: then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore moisten it with warm water at every turn where you dissolve it, and let it be for three days, and loosen the binding a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this I perform the operation, nourishment runs to the member, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	What foolish restorers do from a fracture of a member, when it is not restored at first, according to what is proper, and is restored according to the twisting, is an error from their operation and a great fear: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said that in their books, and they would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen any trace of them at all in that, and it is more correct that it should not be done.

Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fractures are diverse, and its figures are many: and the causes of it are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture which occurs from a blow with a sword: and the blow takes away the bone as far as it reaches to the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood: and on account of that this species of fracture is named Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword strikes a part of the bone, and strikes its surface, and the cut does not penetrate to the utmost of it: and this species of fracture is named Kalan, that is, Absolute Removal.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture which is a crushing or an attrition: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which now approaches the periosteum, which is under the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and there is a wound of these two fractures also, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone to the thinness of a hair: and it is a small crack, and on account of that this species of fracture is named Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from them is a fracture that occurs due to a fall or a blow with a stone, and similar things, which cause the splitting of a bone to go inside, and it happens in the place of the concavity: just as it happens to the brewers of brass, when a blow occurs to them, and a part of them goes inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this happens most often in the heads of moist bones, such as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And there occur to all these kinds of fractures separate displacements, and I will discuss with recollection the entirety of it in its own place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these kinds of fractures through detection over them, and inquiry of them with probes, and removal of corrupted flesh that is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species of the hair-like fracture is recognized by this, that it is detected over the bone, and wiped away, and anointed over it with a plaster: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the cure of a fracture, consider first the accidents of the weak person: then if you see from the accidents that which signifies manifest signs of fear, such as vomiting of bile, and extension, and loss of intellect, and loss of voice, and fainting, and acute fever, and protrusion of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar things to these from the accidents in many dispositions, without doubt it will not be cured: and if you see accidents not terrifying you, and you hope for health: then begin the cure of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if the wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded: and it happens in winter days, then it is necessary that you should strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in summer days, then it is necessary that you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it becomes corrupted what is under the bone from the padding, and those accidents occur which we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	What if the fracture of the bone has now penetrated to the membrane touching the brain, and is with bruising and attraction then it is necessary that you cut the comminuted and attracted part according to what I will tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is that you shave the head of the wounded and uncover the bone according to whatever mode is possible for you and according to the shape of the wound and what is weak above the infirm.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	What if it happens to you upon the uncovering of the bone a flow of blood or a hot aposteme then apply to it what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil and make the wound rest until the aposteme settles and you are secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the cure of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method indeed is, that you cut the bone with a strict edge incisor and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another incisor wider than the first one for a short while and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then administer also another incisor even wider also than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is, that you have with you a number of different incisors, of which some are wider than others, and some of them shorter than others, and let them be at the end sharpened to a point, and made from iron or steel, and use facility in striking on the incisor, so that it does not strike the head and harm it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the bone is strong and hard, then it is necessary that you perforate around it before you administer the incisors, with awls which are called non-penetrating awls, and they are not called thus except that they themselves do not penetrate beyond the end of the bony term into what is behind it, because the awl has a round extremity above what is under the head of its point, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents sinking and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is suitable for you to take from these trephines a large number of which each one is suitable for the quantity of the thickness of the bone, until there is present to you on the whole skull a trephine, whose quantity of sharpness in length and width is according to the quantity of the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three species of trephines, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of making a hole around the broken bone is: that you put the trephine on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone has already been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the trephine to another place, and put what is around the entire hole the quantity of the thickness of the radius, or around it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisors what is around the entire hole in the bone: and make it thinner than you can on the surface of the fineness, as we have said, until you eradicate the bone, either with your hand or with some other of those instruments which you have prepared for that: such as tenailles and subtle forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you proceed with all caution, lest the trephine or incisor touch anything of the brain.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have cut around the bone by making a hole, and it has been separated from the brain, if it was continuous with it, and you extract it, it is necessary that you scrape, and equal the edge of what remains in the bone with another instrument similar to an incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	Truly it is necessary, that it be thin and more subtle than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	What if something remains of the small bones, and fragments: then take them with ease, with that which is with you of instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound afterwards with linen bandages, and ointments which we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of the operation is easy, remote from fear, which Galen said and praised it with great praise, and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin to expose the part of the bone in the location where the fracture is most violent and most apparent, until when you have exposed that part and placed under it the extremity of this lentiform incision, whose shape is this.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lentiform part does not cut anything gently, and its pointed part enters on both sides of it in length, as you see, so that the lentiform part is applied to the saw, with its pointed face cutting into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike on the incisor from one side with a small hammer, until you cut the whole bone with ease, as it turns out, and you will be secure from the accident that you fear.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not the most foolish of men and more ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the pannicle in certain places, he would cut it away from it with the extremity of the lentiform incisor, and free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the pannicle, and that which is cut away from the bone is its face, and there remains in it roughness and subtle scratches: then it is necessary, that you scrape away that roughness, and eradicate those scratches with subtle rasps, which you have prepared in a number of different quantities, so that it is possible for you to administer from them in every place the most convenient of them, and the most correct, according to what the operation leads you to, and the bone itself, fractured, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your scraping, which first scrapes the bone, wider than those of the rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use a finer one after it.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not stop doing that according to continuity, until you reach the thinnest and finest of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small fissures and fine fractures, it is necessary that you administer care according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing which is not hidden above all, to whom in this art there is any study, and it stands on what we have written, and we show in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If indeed the periosteum is detected and retained, when you extract the bone: then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the quantity of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and put it on the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and put it on the first cloth: and make that as easily as you can over it, so that it does not press on the spleen.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer over it a broad ligature: and do not bind it, except by the quantity that the wound holds so much: and leave it with this care for one day, or two days, until you are secure from a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then undo it, and administer after that medicines with which there is excessive dryness: such as the roots of lily, and flour of herb, and powder of frankincense, and aristolochia, and similar to these: and it is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which is powdered over the wounds as they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer on it every medicine of a property whose is that it cleanses and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And beware according to your virtue, that the wound in your cure is clear: and is not in it dirt of ointment, nor filth.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not allow the pus to accumulate in it at all, since when pus accumulates on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and a great malice befalls the weak after that; and now it befalls the cerebral siphrac, when the mouth is cleansed from it, especially when the care of it is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider then, if weaknesses befall, which we have mentioned, you should know that it is perilous without a doubt.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur, unless from the medicine that is placed on it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine, that it makes that blackness: then you should take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and anoint the cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it on the siphrac: afterwards treat it with the species of cures that are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You should know that the nose is not fractured except when both of its upper parts are broken at the same time, or one of them: because it itself has two bones: since the lower part of it is cartilaginous, it does not fracture, and nothing happens to it except bruising, and twisting, and skewing.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts is fractured, then you should insert a small finger into the nostril, and straighten that fracture with your index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and this should be done with art and facility.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, lest pain occurs through your operation on the weak part.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	For if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it: then you should straighten it with the end of a ruler, on which there is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in two parts, then make similar to that: and restore it promptly on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, in the quiet of a warm apostume.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the nostril a pledget of linen from a cloth, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two pledgets if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be in the pledget a thickness of such quantity, which fills the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said, that the pledgets should be soaked in butter, and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That indeed does not seem to me, but rather it is necessary, that the pledget be soaked in the white of an egg, mixed with powder of meal.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the pledget alone, until the bone becomes firm, and the cartilage becomes hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a feather of a goose is inserted into the nose in place of the pledget, after which a linen cloth is wrapped over it: and it is done so that it itself holds the fracture of the nose more vigorously, and so that it does not prevent the weak from inhalation.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this thing is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you use it, do that: and if you wish, make pledgets.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	What if it happens to the nose again while you are operating with a warm apostume, plaster the nose with cerate, or with coten infused in rose oil, or with a little of diacalendine.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If however the warm apostume does not happen, then it is necessary, that you plaster it with flour of sesame, and powder of frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put on top of it a linen swab, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture, or are shattered, then it is necessary, that you cut above them, and extract them with instruments which are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then I dissect and cure it with what promotes flesh and consolidates from suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	What if the wound occurs between the nostrils, then you should cure it with bandages and administer a tube of lead until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken apart.
Caput V.	Chapter Five.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and its fracture is not with a wound, consider then if its fracture is only on the outside and does not break into two, and is bent inwardly, then its treatment is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	It is necessary therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert the index finger of your left hand into the mouth of the weak person: similarly if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and push with it the curvature of the fracture from within with ease to the outside with your other hand from the interior part of the bone, and straighten it with that.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	What if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from both parts, according to straightness: until its equalization is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If indeed a commotion or disruption has already occurred to the teeth, then bind them with threads of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put a bandage over the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then put over it a double cloth, and put over the cloth a large strap made from leather: or a piece of skin sole, equal in length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it up from above, according to the preparation of its bandage, and suitable application, until it is not destroyed: and order the weak person to rest and quiet: and give their food in gentle sips.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If you think that something has already changed in some shape or manner, then apply a poultice and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been changed, and plaster it with a poultice made from the powder of fenugreek, with the white of an egg, or with flour of barley, after you have removed the dandruff: and put a soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While therefore the poultice remains on it, and the arrangement of the bone is not changed, do not remove it, nor dissolve it, until it is healed: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	What if meanwhile a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times for its treatment, until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, take care.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For now a fragment is separated from the bone, or by a cut: then be subtle in this, so that you remove those fragments of the cut with what suits you in removing them with instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If indeed the opening of the wound is narrow, then enlarge it with a lancet according to the quantity of your necessity.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those cuts, and none of them remain, or then the opening of the wound, if it is large: and if not, put on it a plaster that suits it, and incarnates it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Of the restoration of the Jaw, when it is fractured.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The jaw is frequently fractured from the front part of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	For it is either fractured and separated into two, besides the cuts that occur in it: and it is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or that which occurs in the fracture of the jawbone: and is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or it is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation on it when there is a fracture without a wound, is that you should have two assistants present, so that one of them may hold the support that follows the fractured clavicle, and the other stretch the neck towards the affected side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then adjust the fracture with your fingers, until its shape is as it should be, and that it is not in an elevated or depressed state.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	What if you diagnose an excessive extension, then it is necessary that you place under the weak arm a sphere of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to the quantity of your need: and extend and elevate the clavicle, and constrict the sphere with your hand, until it is equal to the fracture, as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	What if you cannot draw the extremity of the clavicle to the outside: because it penetrates to the depth: then it is necessary that the weak one leans upon his neck: and you place under his shoulder a moderate-sized pillow, and an assistant presses his shoulder downwards, until the bone of the clavicle which is in the depth rises upwards: and then you set right the fracture, and adjust it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a displacement from the clavicle, and it moves: then it is necessary that you fix above it, and extract the same displacement with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then make an incision of it with one of the incisors that you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the clavicle an instrument that serves as a splint: and this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It becomes similar to an ear that has no depression.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width is according to that which you measure for it from the size of the bone, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length is also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two extremities, as you see: and one extremity is wide, and the other is narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the disruption of the wound that you cut when you extracted the sequestration of the bone is wide, and you are distant from the hot aposteme: then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or there is a hot aposteme: then fill the wound with cloths, and poultices according to the quantity of the division of the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	What if there occurs a hot aposteme, then wet a cloth in rose oil, and vinegar, and wine, and put it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The narrowing of the bone when it is without a wound, and without a cut, is, as you put on the bone a plaster made from wheat flour with the white of an egg.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put a soft dressing over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then put a ball under its nipple, if you intend that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take the hemp, that is, the rope which the Saracens hold, which should be long indeed: and its width should be a palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then put a double poultice over the dressing and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a splint from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and in length similarly.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the splint in the place of the bandage that falls on the fracture and the place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then put the bandage on the fracture as it is wrapped, and wrap it around its neck, and under its healthy nipple, and under its weak nipple: and bind it all around, and as you see that the tightening holds the fracture with a decent tightening: and it is that which is not hidden from you, and all, so that the splint is not removed from above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason it is necessary that you examine the weak person throughout the whole day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	As often as the ligament is softened, and you see that the splint is already being removed: then correct it, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then put the bandage of the weak person on his back, and put under his armpit near his bandage a small pillow at night, so that his helper may be raised from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the forearm is therefore elevated by elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or tie his arm to his neck: and do not untie the bandage, unless an accident occurs in the place from itching or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see its surface to that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the tightening, and leave it alone, until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And a fracture of the forearm is tightened and comforted according to the majority within twenty days: and sometimes it happens in certain men in less than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the Shoulder blade.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The shoulder blade is rarely fractured, and in the broad place of it: and they are not fractured from it except its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore the place is fractured from it and is fractured in its middle, and it is not recognized except by touch: then according to what is the shape of the fracture, prepare its treatment.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to its natural figure in every way of ingenuity, which is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on the place powder of rose with white of egg, and a soft cloth, and put over it a small pillow from folded linen.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on it a broad splint made from thin wood according to the quantity of the whole shoulder blade, or a little larger than it.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If the ulcer is under the sole and there is a concavity in some location of the Spatula, then equal that concavity with a linen poultice, until the sole descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then tie above with a long ahimemati bandage, of decent constraint and firmness of the sole, until it is not moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligature every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	As often as the ligature is loosened and softened, tighten it, and equal the sole if it is moved from its place: and let the weak one lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the Spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is completed, then untie the ligature: and you will be in security.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is one of the bones whose union is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however a fragment proceeds from the bone and pricks under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said regarding the fracture of the fork from the application of a warm poultice, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On the restoration of the fracture of the Chest.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest is rarely broken in its middle, and it rarely happens to it.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities however are most often broken and united from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is broken, which declines to the lower parts, and there happens to it a severe pain, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps it vomits blood, and it is declared a concavity in the fractured bone, and it is not hidden from feeling, The restoration of it is, that the weak one should be placed on his back: and put between the Spatulas of his shoulder a pillow.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and gather the ribs from both sides or the sides with the hands: and shape it in its equality, according to every mode which is possible for it and is suitable, until the bone figure returns, according to what is proper.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put on it a plaster and a dressing, and put over it a splint made from a thin board of willow or hazel, or similar things in lightness, after you have wrapped it in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then shape the dressing by binding it over the broken bone, so that it is not removed: and go with the binding according to the roundness of the back several times, and tighten it with a decent tightening.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the dressing every hour, and as often as it becomes loose, tighten it: and if necessity demands its solution on account of itching, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess: then hasten, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and rectify what has occurred with the method of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then replace the plaster, if you see it to be good: and add to it a dressing, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the restoration of the Ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a break of the ribs does not happen, except in thick places which follow the back, and from the ends of them on the front side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And damage does not happen to them, except because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from feeling on examination with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in such a way, that you equal the break with the fingers according to the possible mode, until it equals the figure, according to what is proper.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply a plaster, and tighten the broken bone with a splint, if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is declined to the interior, then there occurs to the weak a violent pain and puncture, just like the puncture that occurs to one who has pleurisy: because the bone punctures the membrane, and also there occurs to them difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of much blood: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And now the ancients have contrived in it with many contrivances: and among them there are those who say, that you should apply foods to the weak person which generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly may be inflamed, and extended, and the fracture driven outward.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We indeed disapprove, that a cause for making a hot aposteme does not happen, if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however it has already occurred, then he adds to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them have said: let a bandage be placed on the swollen place, then let it be sucked with force, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Nevertheless, it is feared that the swelling may attract superfluities to the place, on account of the disposition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them have said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been soaked in hot oil: and little balls shall be placed between the ribs, until it is filled: so that there may be an equal bandage when you wrap it around according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then let the weak person be treated with a treatment for pleurisy, from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	For if the severe thing constrains the weak person, which it does not tolerate, and the bone punctures the membrane with a painful puncture, and we fear for the weak person: then it is necessary that we cut over the place, and uncover the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us put on it an instrument that preserves the health, whose mention has preceded: and let us cut the bone with ease, and cut it out.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we shall bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and we shall treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	What if a hot aposteme happens in the meantime, then apply it, and pour in powders mixed with rose oil, and put on the place: and let the weak part be treated with what is suitable for an aposteme.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile also a plaster shall be put on the side on which he sleeps, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of fractures of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter Ten.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	When a fracture occurs to the bones of the neck, and rarely an attrition happens to them, and similarly to the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When then this thing happens to someone, and you want to know, whether it will be healed or not healed, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already made soft, and numbed, and dead: and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor clench them: and when you clench them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not be healed, and in many cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	For if he moves them, and feels in them the clenching with fingers and the pricking: then know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the weak person will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	For if it happens to the vertebrae of the back similarly to that, and you want to know whether it will be healed or not: then consider his feet: then if you see that they are made soft, and there happens to them what happened to the hands: then when he lies on his back, air and flatulence come out without his will: and when he is turned on his stomach, vomiting comes out without his will: and when he is turned on his back, and wants to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	I do not impose labor in its cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If a wound does not become affected by something from it, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment of what happens from it is that you apply a warm dressing to the postule: thus, that you put on the affected spongy part rose oil alone: or with the whites of roasted eggs.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Put on it that same thing several times a day, until when the warm postule is applied: then put on the place one of the strengthening, drying, and constricting plasters, and bind over it with a ligature: and instruct the patient, to use quiet and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not lie on the side where he finds pain, until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	What if it happens with an erosion of the bone or something that is already separated from it: then it is necessary, that you cut over the skin, and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some kind of ointment, from the oils, until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If the end of the bone is fractured, and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary, that you insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and straighten the broken bone with the other hand, according to what is possible, and according to the straightening.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put on it, and take it away: and treat the wound with the treatment that preceded, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Of the restoration of the Ankle.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the ankle are rarely fractured.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	What if they are fractured, then the fracture of them is not, except a crushing in their extremities: and they split along the length, and decline to the interior: and it happens to the patient pain in the place, and puncture: and the leg which is fractured becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is that you stretch out your hand over it, until you are above the fracture as is its shape.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in its extremities, then equalize that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from equalization, until it is assimilated to its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If the fracture is in its length, or it has already declined to the interior, then make the weak one lie on his belly, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have equalized it, put a plaster on it, then put on it a splint of wood or of leather: and bind a bandage over it, which you do not fear to change the fracture, nor removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the concavity of them with what fills it, until the bandage takes it according to equality: and instruct the weak one, that he sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If a hot abscess occurs to him, then cease from extension of it and its restoration, until the hot abscess has settled: and put on it what settles it, according to what has preceded, then return to its restoration: and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If indeed a splinter occurs in the bone, or it is comminuted, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the restoration of the fracture of the elbow.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The elbow is that which is from the cubit to the head of the shoulder blade.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat wood of medium thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And let two bandages be tied on the two extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then let it be suspended from an elevated place: and let the weak person sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should throw his broken arm over a stick, until it reaches his armpit, in the middle of which the curvature of the stick is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then let something heavy be suspended from above, so that the assistant extends it to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician should equal the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns, according to what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is, that the weak person should be raised up on his neck: and his hand should be suspended from his neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two assistants, that one of them should hold what is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other should hold the lower part of it, and each of them should stretch to their respective part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you want it to be a stronger extension, then bind below the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage: and let each of the two assistants stretch them to their two parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed under the armpit, and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a bandage be placed above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equal the fracture with ease without labor, until when the fracture is equal according to what is necessary, and a good application is applied: then bind it, if not a hot abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If indeed a hot abscess occurs, then loosen the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And put on it a piece of wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess subsides: then bind it: and the method of binding it is, that you put a plaster on the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put a dressing made from new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he should place his arm on the helper and put his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put a cloth, and bind it over the helper on the arm, so that the arm stays in place like a star: if nothing prevents you from that, nor is anything altered by you from the fractured bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	What if you fear that something is altered by you from the fractured bone, then use a star: and it is, that you put on the fracture itself a star that is wider and stronger than the other stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And put between every star the width of a finger, and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers on every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the stars a bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your binding on the place of the fracture should be tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture stretches, the less tight the binding should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If then you see the stars and binding as we have said, at the hour in which you restore the limb immediately, then do it: and if you fear a warm aposteme, then remove the binding and stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligature for all three days, so that there does not occur at the place an itch, or swelling, or is prevented food from reaching the limb, on account of the constriction caused by the binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Set it right therefore all that, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you are confident, that nothing will happen from it: then do not undo the ligature, unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the weak person sleep on his back, and his hands on his stomach: and put under the helper a mattress full of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day that the shape of a fractured limb is not disentangled or the bandage loosened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Set it right therefore with all your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give food to the weak according to the order which we have mentioned above, so that at first it is subtle food, until the mouth begins to close: then it is necessary to thicken his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is the custom of the hip and the thigh to be constricted for forty days: then therefore it is necessary that it be loosed, and a bath administered, and treated with ointments which correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is a foul or bruised one, then you will not loosen the bandage from it and apply a plaster until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of the fracture of the arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two forearm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small: and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is that which is placed under the small one from the lower side.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the larger forearm bone alone breaks, or the smaller one: and perhaps they break at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the upper forearm bone breaks, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower forearm bone breaks, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when the two bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that breaks is the upper small forearm bone, then it is fitting for the doctor in restoring it to apply a small extension with ease, until it becomes equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed the large forearm bone is the one that is broken: then it is necessary to apply a stronger bandage.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he puts the shape of a hand near its restoration and its own extension extended over the pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers at the top: and let the joint be lower than all the fingers or the rest: and let the weak [person] sit squarely over itself, and let the pillow be before it, or in its direction, in height, so that the weak [person] does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the servant will stretch out the arm from the lower part, or with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another servant will similarly stretch out from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician reduces the bone, until he brings it back to the best shape that he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	What if in a fracture of the bone there are fragments, then you should reduce and put back every piece in its place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed there appears in it a separated fragment, and it punctures the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration: then sew over it, and remove it according to the method which we mentioned in those things that were previously stated.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If however the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter about that, so take the cure of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	What if at the beginning of your restoration a hot aposteme occurs, then anoint a cloth with a paste made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be a medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth over it with a subtle bandage, until when the aposteme has settled: then remove the paste, and put on a prepared plaster made from powdered flour with the white of an egg.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on splints, and let the splint that is put over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most arrangements: whether the fracture is in one forearm or in two forearms at the same time.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put your bandage over the place of the fracture, stronger and tighter, and somewhat more with the bandage towards the upper part of the fracture, or towards the lower part of it: or put a softer bandage for a short time, according to what was mentioned in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture be gentle cloths, moist: and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is tied be made from linen properly, moderate between subtle and coarse, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligature after some days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	What if something happens that needs correction, such as an itching that happens to the limb: then it is necessary that you bathe the limb with warm water, until that itching calms down, and you release the limb not constricted, until it calms down, then repeat the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	What if the bandage is already softened, and the wound is already healed, and similar things to those: then correct that whole thing with your skill, and examine again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, on account of the excessiveness of the bandage, then it is necessary that you soften it for a little while, and release it for some days, until nourishment runs to it, then tie it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If however nothing happens to the weak person among those things that we have said, then it is not necessary that it be undone, unless after twenty days, or around that time.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then let the hand of the weak person be suspended at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be equal, and be guarded by its strength against agitated movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	The whole of it is secondary to the disposition of the complexions, and the dispositions of the virtues.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that a fracture of the bones of the hand and the joints of the fingers rarely occurs.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to them unless as a result of repeated trauma.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture of the sole or a trauma occurs, then it is necessary that the weak person should sit and in front of him should be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant extends the fractured bones and the physician equalizes them until they join with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he should apply a plaster and a dressing, if not a hot abscess occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a bandage over it according to the quantity of the location, and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is towards the lower part around the belly of the sole, then make a shape like a sphere from cloth, and order the weak person to bind it over his fractured sole, then tie it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the bandage be from leather, in which there is gentleness, so that the leather may be applied to the body of the sole, and tie it according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is towards the outside, then it is necessary that you place a bandage over it and another bandage underneath on the sole, and let the hand be straight and open.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then apply a tightening, as the hand turns, and extend between the fingers with a bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	For if there is a fracture of any of the nodes of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, equalize it according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it with the sole, and if you love him, place for him a straight bandage, small, so that the fracture may be elevated and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is of the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it should be put in place, and bound with the healthy finger that follows it: or all should be bound together according to continuity: and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put on top of it a small star, as we have said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the application of a warm poultice: and apply with it what is necessary, when something happens from that, according to which the account of it is repeated.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the restoration of the fracture of the thigh.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often fractured and is revealed to sensation: since it turns to the inner and back part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done in such a way that a ligament is tied above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And a plaster is spread over its surface.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then every ministering bandage should be stretched out to its own part according to equality: and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let the bandage be on the side of the chest, so that the extension falls upwards: and another bandage below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let the bandage be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician balances the bone with both his hands, until he reduces it according to the likeness of its natural shape: and the bone is joined with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you put on a plaster and a bandage, if an aposteme does not happen to the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	For if an aposteme happens in it: then leave it for some days, until the warm aposteme subsides, then return to your cure.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The narrowing of it should be thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you apply a hard bandage over the fracture, that is, a binding: and fold it twice or thrice: and let some of it remain as an excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then bind the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread emerge from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap over the leg and thigh what remains in excess of the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put over the thigh at the place of the fracture a small stick, and put one of them as a stick over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the emptiness between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that it may equal the narrowing.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle over the place of the fracture with three or four windings.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you stretch it with a bandage away from the place of the fracture, let your binding be the less and softer and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then tie to the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind therefore with each of the three sticks that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then tie with the two ends of the thread downwards, until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And bind also with each of them the ends of the sticks from the other side, so that the bandage is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then leave the bandage over that, while it remains, so that there does not occur to the limb a corrosion, nor an abscess, nor an inflammation, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything of that should happen.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Treat it therefore with its remedy, and correct what has happened there entirely, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If there is a fragment of bone in the bone that punctures: then it is necessary, that you should reduce it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find above it and remove it: and treat with that which the aforementioned treatment has reminded, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is tightened, besides that the sides are added to it, as we have said in the case of the shoulder and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	Truly however in the restoration of such a fracture, lameness does not happen to the weak.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides that the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary, that he whose it is, will always be lame.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is tightened in fifty days, or a little more or a little less: all that is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of the fracture of the knee.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that the knee rarely suffers a fracture, but it often suffers an injury.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed a fracture happens to it, then it is not except for a fissure or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And let all of that be treated with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is such that it should unite what has been disrupted from its parts with the fingers, until it aggregates and is joined according to what is possible from equality and facility and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put a plaster made from the flour of sesames, or of meal, with the white of egg: and put on top of it a round piece of wood, if you apply it: and tie above it a bandage fitting to that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions that we have narrated concerning other fractures: such as a hot poultice, and similar things: so that you oppose every accident with what is suitable for it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a fracture of the neck
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that the neck has two bones, one of which is thick and is named with the name of neck: and the other subtle, and is named gullet.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both species of fracture that which happens to the two bones of the arm: and because of that its restoration is made, just like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	Which if the two bones are broken at the same time, the leg turns to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the subtle bone is broken, the leg turns to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thick bone is broken, you find that below: and it is one of those things which are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and alignment, and binding of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	Truly it is necessary, if the fracture of the neck is a foul fracture, having many sores: that there should be less extension, and a lighter alleviation by you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the neck there is something from the operation beyond the arm: and it is, when you equal the stars, and complete all your operation, then take two splints of pine wood, which is administered in the fabrication of cots that are placed under the tables: and they are made from palm splints: and choose from them those which have a small thickness, and not be among the smallest: and let their length be according to the length of the neck from the knee down below.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each one a cloth with two wrappings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And put one part of the neck on one side, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot below.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind two splints in three places with two extremities and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when the constriction is prohibited, the leg declines to the right and left, and it stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now let a wooden splint be administered according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it conserves it from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is very necessary, that you should do that in the fracture when there is a wound with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then examine the leg every day, and study it with utmost care for signs of abscess, or inflammation, or other remainders.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore anything of those things happens, then oppose to it what is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture indeed does not deeply affect the heel bone.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot are subject to fracture, and the toes also are subject to fracture; and it does not happen to them except due to trauma in many instances.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture happens to the bones of the foot, and you see those bones displaced above each other, then let the weak foot be placed on the prepared ground, as when walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand and place your foot on what is elevated by those bones: afterwards press, or tread on it: and make it even, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a plaster, and put a dressing over it: and place under the sole of the foot a small board, which has two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with the foot by a suitable ligature, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things which it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed for them, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones even, whether they were fractured, or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation therefore is in them, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If some of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them equal according to what I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put a bar on your finger according to the length of the finger, and let it be slightly wider than that: then place under the foot this board which I have described to you, and tighten it with a decent strap.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed that which is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then put on top of each finger a bar of its own quantity, wrapped in a linen cloth: and tighten the board under the foot: and let it stand on one end of the board outside the belly of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you, that you do not forget, but consider all things that I have told you regarding the remaining fractures from accidents which we have mentioned: and apply to each accident what is appropriate.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the breastbone, and the rod of a man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is broken, then make her sit squarely.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then bend her slightly to the back part of the same, and let it be held from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then fill up the vulva with a sponge, until it fills it: and let it become in the vulva like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then strike the woman, and raise her back little by little.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that sponge comes out, until it becomes before the entrance of the vulva like a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a pillow on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she gets up to urinate, remove the sponge with ease, then she urinates: and put it back according to the manner in which you first introduced it: then let her return to her first pillow.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	It should be done for seven days, or thereabout, because the mouth itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you need to, take a vesica of a reed, and tie a thread of papyrus over its opening, and insert the entire vesica into its vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force, until the vesica is inflated inside the vulva, for the fracture will be restored.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with a paste, and let it stand for some days, according to what we have narrated, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the jawbone of a man or a woman is fractured, then administer its restoration, and its alignment according to what we have narrated concerning the bone of the ankle.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And let not the rectitude be hidden in these near fractures, which little touch, especially to one who has something of study, or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book, which is much, for the fracture itself shows you in many dispositions the right way in its restoration, and its alignment: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When a man's rod is fractured, take the gullet of a goose, and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put over it a dressing made from cloth, and let it be wrapped, and let it be left for three days, or about that time, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Of the restoration of fractures of bones, when there is with a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for one to whom a fracture with a wound happens, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or the like, that bloodletting be applied immediately: if the conditions of bloodletting are attested to you, as we have previously stated.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	For if the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary, that you proceed to the cutting of it, so that you powder over it a little powdered zeolite: if there is not present to you another thing.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not postpone it, if an abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If a hot abscess occurs, then desist from the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause bad accidents to happen to it.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If the fractured bone is protruding above the skin, then it is necessary that you should gently reduce it and adjust it with your hands with ease and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If the extension of it and its adjustment with your hands is not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is an instrument made of iron, the length of which is seven or eight fingerbreadths, and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And on account of that it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them according to the quantity that he needs for the cure in every type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round and let there be a small thickness in it so that it does not double at the time of compression during the operation: and let it have a sharp point, which has a margin at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be thick from the middle of it to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the pointed curved end of it be placed over the end of the prominent bone: and drive it with one blow, until when the bone returns and is adjusted by some adjustment.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, take care to adjust the ends of the fracture to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the fractured ends are thin and do not take the instrument with a good grip, then it is necessary that you should cut the end of the bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce the bone with what we have described, then cut it with what is suitable for it from the incisions that we mentioned: or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape what remains in the bone from roughness and small cortices.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced and the weak one finds after its reduction a vehement and piercing pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do it therefore.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer on the weak one a great benefit, when your restoration is completed which you do to the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then submerge a cloth in black styptic wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not apply a cerate over the wound, nor anything in which there is oil, so that it does not cause to happen in it putrefaction and corruption.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the stars at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And uncover the wound: thus, that you cut with a fork a hole in the bandages according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with all caution, lest you bind the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many foolish doctors have done this: and have caused to happen to their patients either death, or corruption, or ichor, that is, pus.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your dressing be soft, gentle, different from the dressings of fractures and other things.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	For if the wound is bad, or it is a great wound, and you find on it certain bad accidents which we have described, and you find pain in the suspended place: then it is not fitting that you apply the stars to it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them bandages from hard cloths in the place of the stars, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove from above the dressing that you placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply plasters and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as the four-drug ointment and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every day morning and evening, until it heals and becomes whole.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the member be prepared in such a way that pus runs out of it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass for the wound and it does not heal, nor is the pus separated from it: then know that there are small pieces of bone there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary to examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	Whatever of those small pieces of bone are separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those of them that are not separated and prick the member and cause pain, try to cut around them and remove them in every way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If there occurs to the wound zuchen or ekileten, that is, eschar, or another species of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary that you oppose each one of them with what is suitable for it from the cure, the account of which has been given in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from that in which it is necessary that my speech stands, and to which you should direct your attention when the bone is fractured, and protrudes over the member, such as the hip bone, and the shoulder, and similar ones of the large members, it is that you should not attempt to reduce the fracture, for many times death occurs from this, rather leave it alone until it becomes putrid.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	The dressing will fall off by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then attend to the cure of the wound, if it seems so to you: and if not, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the cure of swelling in a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This swelling often occurs in the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially one that is near the joints, and is disfigured from the shape of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the limb from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider then if the swelling is recent: administer to it medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and gum arabic, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Take some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or with the whites of eggs, or with vinegar: and apply them to the swelling in a poultice, and bind them tightly around it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the dressing on, and do not remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then untie it, and apply another, until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over it a strip of lead sheeting.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing every swelling from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already turned to stone, and is hard, and necessity urgently demands its removal: then cut into it from the top part of it, and incise the prominent excess: or shave it with certain razors, until it is removed: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	On the cure when restoration occurs, and a limb remains after that subtle, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fracture of the bone is restored, and the limb remains after that weak and subtle: then this does not happen except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of them is the multitude of the solution of the ligament and its ligation not according to what is necessary: either because of the excess of tightness of the ligaments, until nourishment is prohibited from running to the member: or because of the multitude of superfluous embrocation at not its hour: or because of the paucity of blood in the body of the infirm, and its debility.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the cure of it is to feed the infirm, and to make tender its body, until blood is multiplied in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And bring joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put pitch on the member: that it may attract much nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And repeat its embrocation with warm water, until nourishment runs and it returns to its natural figure.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Of the cure of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens to a member already restored after its healing that crookedness and prominence of the fractured bone or knot occur, and the form of the member is disfigured by it, nevertheless the member is not prohibited from its natural operation: then it is not necessary that you take the advice of him who thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And now there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is very reprehensible, leading to death, or great fear, as if it were mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knot are recent: then it is necessary that an embrocation be made with warm water, in which are decocted softening herbs, such as the leaves of marshmallow, and its root, and melilot, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made for it with a softening plaster, such as diachylon well prepared.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Let there be applied a poultice of the root of altea, and let it be mixed with hen's fat or with oil of sesanum, and let it be plastered on.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Let there be applied fat figs, and let them be rubbed with dove's dung, and similar things which are named from medicines that diminish consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the knot is dissolved with continuous, gentle, and soft rubbing, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let movement of the limb be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If however the twisting has already come beforehand, and it has become strong, and it has turned into a stone, and necessity has been provoked for its treatment with iron: then it is necessary that the above of it be cut, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and that which exceeds from the knot or bone be cut out with subtle incisions: and let facility be administered to it with solicitude and study.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On speech in Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 23.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of a joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	For which it is prohibited from its movement, and the shape of the limb is deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes pains to occur on the weak part, and vehement injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore a dislocation occurs to someone, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration: and let it not be delayed at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes putrid, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	On account of this therefore it is not necessary that it be moved, nor extended at the time of its putridness.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Since often it causes spasms to occur, and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that occurs, then it is necessary that you proceed to bloodletting of the weak part.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be applied, until the aposteme quiets.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then let the limb be anointed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then let it be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And the whole limb should be treated with that which will bring back its memory to its own place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already discussed the chapters on dislocation, and also according to what preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely dislocated at the same time.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are removed from their places by a slight movement, and become slightly softened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation, until they become softened to the part of the chest, until the saliva of the weak one runs, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is involved with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however the dislocation of it is slight, then it returns in many cases by itself with little trouble.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If indeed the dislocation is complete and entire: then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and it is that the assistant should hold the head of the weak one: and the physician should insert the thumb of his hand into the root of the dislocated jaw between his teeth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he should insert both thumbs at the same time, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the other fingers of his hands are outside, which he uses to pull.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the weak one, that he should clean his jaws, and loosen them for chewing in every direction.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician pulls the jaw, and pushes the jaw, until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	What if the reduction of it is difficult, especially if both jaws are together, then administer vapor with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy, and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When the jaws go back and become even, and the weak mouth is closed and not softened: then put over them cotton pads with cerate made from wax and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it should be bound with ease with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And the weak person should sleep on their back and their head should be steady between two pillows, so that it does not move to the right or left: and it should not be forced, or compelled to chew anything: instead soft food should be given to them to eat, until when the pain is relieved, and the jaw is knotted: then they should eat what they want, and it should be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not exert himself over the operation of his mouth in eating and drinking, and spitting, until the jaw is knotted and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	What if the reduction of two jaws is difficult, when they become dislocated at some hour, and do not return to their places: then often there occur from it fevers and constant sweating: and perhaps the weak bowel is loosened, and perhaps pure bile is vomited.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you see that, then know that it is a loss, and often he to whom it happens dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of dislocation of the elbow, and the extremity of the shoulder.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The elbow indeed is not dislocated from the inner side, on account of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it becomes dislocated sometimes to the outside: and that is made clear by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, for the weak person to lie on their back, and to stretch out their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then press the constricted place with your palm, for it will return to its original state.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put on it a plaster, and poultices, and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities of the bones which follow the elbow and are connected with it are not dislocated except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	What if it becomes dislocated on the same day: then it should be reduced and adjusted according to what we have said, and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put on it a plaster, and poultices, and a bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the weak person to adhere to stillness and quiet, until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the extremity of the shoulder is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of which one is, that it is dislocated to the armpit downwards.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is, that it is dislocated towards the breast.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the shoulder, and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated to the back, because of the blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated to the front, because of the nerve.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And most often it is dislocated and protrudes downwards towards the armpit, especially in those whose flesh is scant.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For it protrudes quickly in them, and also goes back quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those, however, whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, namely that it protrudes with difficulty and goes back with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men a blow or a fall, and the shoulder is struck with a warm poultice, and it is thought on account of that, that it is already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary, therefore, that you should test that, until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And a dislocation is recognized when it turns to the lower part of the shoulder, and you will distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find between them a clear difference, and you will find at the head of the shoulder a concavity, and below the shoulder joint on touching the head of the humerus as if it were an egg: and the weak one cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if the shoulder is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, then you will find a palpable feeling, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And the reduction of this type of dislocation is easy, when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, that one elevates the hand of the patient upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under the shoulder joint, and lift the joint with force upwards to its place: and the patient lifts his hand, and extends it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he puts it down below, for he returns quickly himself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If however it does not return by what we have said, and there are many days since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the patient should bathe in warm water, and an embrocation which softens and soothes, such as if they decoct roots of alteae, and fenugreek, and melilot in water, and administer.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient should be raised on his back: and let a sphere and wool be placed under the shoulder joint, which is equal between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then let the physician place his heel on the sphere, and lift the head of the humerus with strength, and draw the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And let another person hold the head of the weak one, so that it is not moved to the lower parts: for he himself will return immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you do, draw him back according to this method: and it is, that you make the strong man be present who is longer than the weak one, and stand at his side, and insert his shoulder under the armpit of the weak one: and lift up his armpit to the upper parts, until the weak one is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And let another person pull the hand of the weak one to the lower parts of his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If the weak person is lightweight: then it is necessary, that something else be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down: for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also drawn back according to another method: and it is, that a long piece of wood be fixed in the ground, whose head is round in shape: like a mason's bucket: which is neither thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then let there be placed under the weak one, after they have been put on top of the head of the wood, soft cloths: and let the weak one stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then let his hand be extended to the lower parts from the other side, and let his body be extended from the other side with strength: for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	What if the reduction of it is difficult through all that we have said, then use this cure: and it is, that you take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: which has a round head, so that its entrance is alleviated into the depth of the armpit, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then let soft cloths be tied around the round head, so that the wood does not harm the weak one.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then let it be placed under the armpit of the weak one, so that the hand or arm extends over the wood to the lower parts: and let the wood be tied above as an aid to the arm and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm is placed above the step of the ladder in width, and the hand is extended to the lower parts, and the rest of the body is suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint immediately enters.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When I raise it completes its entrance in whatever way is possible: then it is necessary, that you put under the armpit a sphere of equal quantity made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then put a plaster prepared from powder of millet with benzoin and the white of an egg all over the shoulder, as it turns out from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind under the armpit a tight bandage: and turn the dressing around the plaster from above: and tie his hand to his neck, and let it be, nor move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that weak food be given, until the member is comforted: for it is more speedy to its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one is put on after seven days, or five, and it is exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If then it becomes firm and is not softened, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the joint is dislocated many times, on account of humidity which happened to it, or on account of another cause: then it is necessary that a cautery be administered to it with three openings, according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	What if all this is done, and the bandage is loosed after seven days, and the joint is not confirmed, and the plaster and dressing are put on it many times, and it does not become firm, and it falls, and it cannot be lifted to the upper parts: then know that the nerves which are at the head of the shoulder are already cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But dislocation which occurs towards the chest and breast, or reduction to the back, is done with pushing and extending with the hands: until it returns, and the rest of the dressing and care are administered to it, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	What if after healing heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness in its movement then let the weak one use a bath many times until that heaviness is alleviated and it returns to its first nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the cure of dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and likewise returns with difficulty also: and it dislocates to all parts, and especially to the front or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: since it falls under sight and under touch, according to whatever figure it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is shown to you plainly.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is shortened and cannot double the arm, nor touch with it its own shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hurry and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a warm aposteme happens to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a warm aposteme happens to it, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it is not healed at all, especially when it is to the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocation, and a more vehement pain is to them: and many times death descends with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration when it is among those things which are possible to reduce, is that the hand of it is extended with two hands: and its arm is stretched out, and the hands of the physician are above the elbow and below it, and he himself pushes the joint with his thumbs simultaneously, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or indeed the dislocation is to the front: then it returns thus, that he doubles his hand with his own hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	What if it does not obey dislocation to reduction, then administer a vehement extension, a strong one; and it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants should hold it too, so that it is not moved during extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm should be turned to any part after a double cloth or a broad bandage has been wrapped over the hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches his joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil: so that it is one of those things which help with the slipperiness of the joint and with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should push the joint with a strong push until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be placed over it, in which there is astringency and excitation with the whites of eggs: and that it be bound with a decent bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the neck of the invalid, and let it be left for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then let it be loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If then the joint is stabilized in its place, then undo the bandage from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not being well bound, then apply another plaster, and bandage, and leave it for some days, until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however heaviness occurs to it after the reduction of the joint, and the arrangement is in motion: then administer a moistening in bathing, and subtle rubbing, and compression, until it is soothed, or place on the joint of the ilium, that is, the fat of the hog's belly.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then let it be bound, and leave it over it for a day and a night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and put it into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When it sweats, then rub the joint with a moderate rubbing.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then anoint it again with the same ointment one time, and a second, and a third with the entrance of the bath, until it is softened.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, put on it a warm and moist poultice of dung, heated with butter, and bind it over.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It itself becomes soft, and returns to its own condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	Of the cure of the dislocation of Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The shoulder is often dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	On the contrary, of the rest of the joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	But truly it is necessary, that there be speed in the reduction of its dislocation in the hour in which it becomes dislocated, before the place becomes infected: or an infection of heat occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation in it is, that you put the dislocated shoulder on a table, and an assistant extends the hand of it: and the physician puts his palm on the prominence of the joint, and presses it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	But truly it is necessary, that it be considered, if the palm has already receded to the thumb of the hand: then let the weak one put the back of his hand on the table at the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then let the position of the hand be turned inside on the table, that is, the inner part of the hand be put on the table, so that the hand of the physician falls on the same prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a plaster to calm the infection: and leave it, and do not repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you achieve reduction of it, after the days have passed, truly the joint remains according to its deformity: and nothing hurts the weak one, except that the hand becomes softened, and cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves are cut, or injured.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no ingenuity in it, except that it should be seared with a cautery near the fall of it.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not bring together that something.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Almahassem does not cause to return, then put on it the plaster which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then let it be seared and left for five days: afterwards let it be undone and left, and the hand exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however the motion of it is deprived, and there occurs to it something heavy: then let it be soothed with warm water, and rubbed several times, until it is soothed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the cure of dislocations of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated to any part, or a finger to the back of the palm, or its belly: then extend the finger, and push back the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then hold the head of the finger, and suspend it in the opposite direction to that in which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it becomes straight on its own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore it has been night, bind it according to the same description: and do not cease to unbind it by day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it by night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for some days, until it becomes seared.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do similarly with it, if it is dislocated to the palm of the hand: and bind it to the same part, and perform your first operation with it, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do similarly with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the cure of dislocations of the vertebrae of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When there occurs to anyone a dislocation of the vertebrae of the back, or a dislocation of the neck, either complete or with many vertebrae out of their places: then there is no cure for it, because death quickly follows the infirmity.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of it is that the weak evacuation comes out without control, and it cannot hold it: and often some of its members become soft because of it, or two of its legs, or two of its arms, or one of them: or one vertebra is displaced from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it is moved, because often a dislocation to the four parts is made.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That therefore which is dislocated to the back, is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of it is, that you should consider then, if the gibbosity occurs from youth: then there is no treatment for it, nor is there any healing from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In that, however, which occurs from a fall, or a blow, or similar things to those, the ancients have already spoken of the methods of treatment in lengthy discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Whose benefit is not returned with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have already abbreviated from that which excuses little because of its great length from my closeness to the intention: and my exposition, which I have expounded it, and formed the instrument of it in a different manner than that which they showed it, and expounded.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that in the gibbosity which occurs from the front part, there is no device, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And likewise in that which occurs to the two sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not treated from them, unless that which occurs in the back properly, with what I tell: and it is, that the weak person is stretched out on his face on a level platform near the wall: and a moist cloth is spread under him, so that his chest is not hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight stick is fixed in a hole in the ground, at the end of the platform, near his head: and another stick near his feet at the other end of the platform: and an assistant holds the stick, and it is not fixed in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And one servant should hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then tie above the head of the weak person, and under its pillows a linen bandage, firm, and extend the extremity of the bandage to the stick which is near its head, and tie it on that.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then bind another bandage above its hips, and above its knees, and at its ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages together, and tie them on another stick which is near its feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then each servant should pull the bandage to the part of the stick, and the two sticks should not be moved from their places where they are fixed: nevertheless they should not be tightened, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician should place his palms on the spine with force, until it returns to its place, or he should place a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he should attach his feet on the board, until it returns to its place.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If however it does not return to its place through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And bore into the wall which we spoke of, that is near the weak person, a place for the extremity of the board to enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the physician should put his feet on the other extremity.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And he should pull firmly, until the spine is constricted and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with the lathe that turns with your hand: and it is, as if you fix in the ground near the head of the weak person at the end of the bed two sticks, whose length is one cubit: and near its head at the end of the bed two sticks.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length that is between each stick be one palm: and now a hole has been made in every place where the lathe runs: and each stick should be firmly fixed in the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And a round stick is inserted: and it is turned on which the ligature revolves in two holes of two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole, in which the stick is fixed, whose length is a palm with what revolves: and in two other sticks there is similarly one of them.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligatures that you tightened on the chest with the turnstile that is at its head: and the ligatures that you tightened on its shins with the turnstile that is at its feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let a servant stand at each turnstile, who twists his hand with the cloth, with which the turnstile revolves: and the physician adjusts the Spondilem, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turnstile, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the Spondilis returns, and the place is adjusted, then it is necessary that you put an excitatory plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then a dressing.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards put on top of the plaster a splint made from a board, whose width is three fingers, or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length such quantity as to cover the place of the gibbosity, and over the healthy part of the Spondilem.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then let it be tied with a ligature that we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the weak person use subtle nourishment, until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	What if something of elevation remains in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, with the administration of a board as we have described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now let it be applied on that plate of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when there occurs an elevation in the last vertebrae of the back: and it is thought to be through that a dislocation, and it is that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	It is not suitable that a supposition should be made for him with this medicine: perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	On the cure of a dislocated shoulder.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the joints of the shoulder and the joints of the arm do not undergo anything except dislocation, nor does what happens to other joints from slight movement and concavity happen to them.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the joint of the shoulder is dislocated in four directions.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, it dislocates to the front and to the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And most often it dislocates inwardly, and a little to the front and to the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation inwardly is: that when you join the weak leg to the healthy one, it is longer: and its knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the weak one cannot bend its foot at the groin: and the place which follows the groin is anointed with a warm apostema, because the head of the hip has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of one to whom dislocation outwardly happens is that its accidents are contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of one to whom dislocation forwardly happens is that it stretches out the healthy leg according to its full length: nevertheless it does not bend it without pain which is in the knee: and if it tries to walk, it cannot step forward on it: and its urine is retained, and its groin is anointed, and upon walking there is a gait with the foot over the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of one to whom dislocation backwardly happens is that it does not stretch out the knee, nor can it bend it before it bends the groin: and its leg is also shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation of the species is to be considered, as you would consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has already become ancient with the one having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its own disposition: then there is not in it a cure at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Not so it is fitting, that a deep probing should be made to it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that one however whose dislocation is recent, and is one of the four species of dislocation: then it is proper to this, that you should move the joint, and extend it to the interior and to the exterior, and move it to the right and to the left: for perhaps it returns, and does not need another cure.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If however it does not return in this manner, then it is fitting, that you should prepare a strong minister, and he should extend the leg of it from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a ligature, which is tied above its leg above the knee: and another minister extends his hand above, so that he inserts his hands under its armpits.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie with a soft ligature above the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other ligature.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And its extension is either from the front part of the groin to the part of the armpit, or from the back to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let its extension be for all of them as one, until the weak one is lifted with its body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this indeed is a species of extension which is a common species of the four species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If then the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for every species that which I will say about its own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of it indeed, when the dislocation is to the interior, it is fitting that the weak one should be placed on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should put a ligature on the root of the hip, where it is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then he should extend the ligature upwards from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the thigh.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong servant should take his arms and cut the thick part of the weak hip and stretch it to the outer extension of the dislocation.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For it has now returned to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the other types of treatment by which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it protrudes above you and does not obey you at the entrance with this type of treatment altogether, then it is necessary that the two weak feet be bound together with a strong ligature, gentle, over the two ankles and over the two knees: and let the length of each be from its fellow as much as four fingers, and let the weak leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the weak one should be suspended over a wooden beam that is in the house: and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then instruct a strong youth to support the head of the hip: and let another youth be suspended with the weak one: and let another youth push, supporting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	But in the reduction of it to its proper place, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the weak one lie on a couch, according to what we have described in the case of having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let a ligature be tied over his leg, weak by nature, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two wooden beams should be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then an additional wooden beam should be placed in the middle of the couch, fixed well: over which wet cloths should be wrapped, so that it does not harm the weak one: and let the beam be between his hips, so that it is not pulled downwards at the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then the assistant should stretch out to his own side, and the physician should achieve reduction with his own hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If then it cuts to the turning back, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, put on it a plate, and press on it, as we said in the case of hunchback, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However it is suitable, that the weak one should lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is suitable that the weak leg should be stretched out quickly: and it is according to this same narrative on the couch: and the physician should put the palm of his right hand on the weak groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should hold it with his other hand, and with that holding put it extended downwards to the knee joint.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not suitable that the weak one should be stretched out downwards and be raised above the ground: but rather it is suitable that he should be placed on a hard surface, as it is also suitable if his hip dislocates outwardly, according to what we said about him lying on both hips: and it is on his face, and the ligaments are extended: according to what we said just before.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is suitable that compression should be administered with a plate also on the place from which the joint protrudes, when the reduction is completed according to what is suitable.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is that you should stretch out the two weak legs: and when you see them equal, and the weak one draws in his leg, and stretches it out without effort: then you should know that the limb has returned according to what is suitable: then you should join the two hips, and put on a plaster, and bind with a wrap, that is, a bandage: so that it may not move the hip to any side: and let the weak one adhere to quiet for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then untie the bandage, and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in condition, then you will know that the displacement has already been fixed: therefore set the weak one to walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see something of softening: then return and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then untie it and make it walk slowly on both for some days, until it is well comforted.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Of the Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and to the bottom, namely to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you will make the weak one apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not stick to the hip, then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of its dislocation is, that you make the weak one sit upright, so that it now extends its leg if it can over that, and you stick your back to his face: and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make his knee stick to your palms, and straighten them between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of the return is, that the leg sticks to the hip with gentleness, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it, and make the leg stick to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And he should not walk at all for some days, until he is cured.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If however the reduction of it refuses you, then administer a strong extension with bandages, the description of which has preceded in the cure of hernia, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the cure of dislocation of the heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel is sometimes put back with a little manipulation, and sometimes it is displaced according to its completion.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs, either to the inside or to the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, bulging out towards the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its reduction is easy: and it is that it should be extended with ease by the hands, and adjusted, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the cure of it when it is dislocated according to its completion, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright: and a strong assistant should hold him firmly from behind, in the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you should hold with your right hand his foot from the top of it, and with your left hand from the bottom of his foot at the place of the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards yourself with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left hand in two places.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend it with the left, and push the bottom of the foot with the right, turning the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the bottom of the foot to the leg in a third place, and you pull the ankle.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If indeed it returns to one place, or to two places according to this method, and you see the foot equal, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on it, since it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If then the reduction of it is prohibited to you with what we have narrated: then make the weak person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a strong stake in the earth, so that it falls between his hips: and you have now wrapped around it a cloth, so that it does not harm the weak person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the assistant take his thigh: afterwards the assistant should stretch the other leg, either with his hands, or with a bandage that binds above the ankle of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let the assistant stretch everything in opposition to the stretching of his companion: and the stake should stand between the two hips of the weak person, holding it, so that his body is not drawn downwards at the bottom during the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician adjusts the dislocation with his hands, and the other assistant should hold the healthy leg below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with swiftness.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When then the dislocation returns, and the health of its return is declared to you: then put on a plaster and a poultice, and bind it with strong bandages, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or avoid the nerves which are above the posterior heel, so that the bandage is not tight over them and harms them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	What if the bandage becomes loosened, bind it: then untie it on the third or fourth day: and prohibit the weak person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If indeed he tries to walk before that time, there will not be security unless the dislocation is dissolved over it, and becomes corrupted, and it does not receive a cure afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	What if a hot abscess happens to him: then it is necessary that you administer to his sitting that which our narration previously mentioned in another place concerning the cure, and an embrocation, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the dislocation of the toes and their treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated should be reduced with a few extensions without labor, and that indeed is not difficult, rather it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in certain nodes of the sole of the foot, then it is necessary that the weak person sits with his foot on a level place on the ground or on a board, and he stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and put your foot on that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then tread on it with your foot with strength, until it returns, and you will see that it is already evened, and the protrusion does not appear in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the sole of his foot a board which can hold the whole foot, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a bandage for three days suitably.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then untie it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and secured from the dislocation.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the types of dislocation with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of that kind happens, and you consider its treatment and restoration, death often occurs, and because of this it is not fitting to presume upon the treatment of such a thing, except for one who is prudent in the art with long practice, merciful, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous: and so that he use in his treatment medicines which quieten hot apostems only: and commit the weak person to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see or hope for health from destruction with mildness of sickness, and in which something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore consider the reduction of it at once in the beginning of the thing, before a hot apostem happens.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If then the member is restored, second to which the will, then administer the regime that calms the abscess: and cure the wound with that which agrees to it from dried ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	What if it is a dislocation with a fracture, and they occur in the separated bone of the knee, then conjoin the separation of them, and do in that which we said in simple ailments from what preceded in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from the entrance into the way of fear: according to what my preceding warning has said to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and more healthy to your body among them in your time.
