 CHAPTER FIFTEEN.
On adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
 This adhesion happens to many people, the upper lid sticking to the white of the eye and hindering its movement and preventing its natural functions.
You should introduce the end of a probe beneath the lid and raise it upward; or stretch it with a hook.
Then cut the adhesion with a fine scalpel; it should not be so sharp as a cutting scalpel, but somewhat blunt, lest during the operation the patient should shake, and the scalpel slip, and the edge injure the eye.
Let your incision be as if peeling off the adhesion.
Wait until the lid regains its natural shape and the adhesions be wholly healed.
Then rinse the eye with saline and cleanse it; or instil into it drops of a watery solution of eye-lotion of verdigris.
Then separate between the eye and the lid with a linen pad and put over the eye a piece of wool moistened with white of egg; and after the third day employ healing eye-lotions till it is better.
