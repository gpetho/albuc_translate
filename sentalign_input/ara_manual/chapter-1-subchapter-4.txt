Chapter Four.
Cauterization of Chronic Migraine.
If you treat the migraine with the aforementioned treatments mentioned in the sections on diseases and the treatment is not successful, and you see from the illness that it is not sufficiently treated by the aforementioned first cauterization with medication or cauterization by fire.
Then you should heat the knife-like cautery until it becomes white-hot after you have marked the painful area with a line half a finger long or thereabouts, and you should draw your hand across it once, pulling it tightly until you sever the artery and reach the bone.
However, you must be careful to avoid touching the jaw, which moves during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or the nerve that moves it, which would cause convulsions.
And be cautious and attentive regarding the bleeding from the artery that you cut, for there is danger in severing it.
Especially for someone who is ignorant of what to do and is not experienced and practiced, it is better to abandon the procedure.
And the management of bleeding arising from the artery will be mentioned in its proper place in the book, God willing. If you see a condition that this cauterization does not address...
And if you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle of the head, as we have described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on arterial hemorrhage with the two-bladed cautery iron, for it is a better and more effective cautery than this.
