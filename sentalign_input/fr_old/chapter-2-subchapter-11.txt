About the hairs of the eyelids
When hairs other than the natural ones grow on the eyelids, and they are thick, they harm the eyes, and cause various diseases such as habitual tearing and softening of the eyelids and albugine, to the point that it causes the destruction of the eyes; and the treatment is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is before in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suturing or by hooks, according to what I will say.
You must place the patientâ€™s head in your lap, then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand; if it is turned, that is good; if not, then place a needle with a thread on it; and let this be near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow next to these hairs, and pull a thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a razor; then cut on the lower part of the eyelid, below the added hairs, with the cutting spatula, from the large tear duct to the small one; then extract the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and cloth under the eyelid, then mark on the eyelid a figure of an anchor, like a myrtle leaf, and the figure must be according to the quantity that you want to raise the eyelid which is described to all.
And there are some cases where it is necessary to cut a large amount of the eyelid according to how much the eyelid is softened; then cut with the spatula along the two lines that you have marked, and start from the large tear duct to the small one; and let one of the cuts be near the natural hairs with the thickness of a root, then place the hook in one of the two corners of the incision, then scrape it all; then join the two lips with a stitch of a needle with a fine wool thread, and wipe the blood, and burn the excess threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substances, if you wish to do this; if not, do not worry about it, then leave the stitch and the threads for three or four days; then treat the wound without stitching with drying and constricting substances, for the eyelid rises with the healing of the wound and its joining, but the stitch is better (as the ancients said), and it is a procedure without fear.
and there is another method: and it is that you mark the eyelid with a figure that is like a myrtle leaf, as we have explained, with three separated hooks according to the form that is here:
then cut what exceeds with small scissors evenly according to the form that is here:
And if you cannot hold the pincers, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with a thread, and place it in the middle of the figure; and place another thread near the large tear duct, and the second thread near the small one, and gather the threads evenly between your fingers; then raise your hand evenly, and lift all the skin that you have marked, as we have explained, then join the two lips of the wound by stitching, and treat it until it is healed; and if an abscess comes to your incision, then soothe it with wax and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelid are inverted: then you must use what we have said about the incision; but the stitching in both is more artificial.
The treatment with hooks is according to this form: and it is that you turn the eyelid and cut inside according to what I have said, and then make two hooks by art, and two delicate threads as long as the eyelid and the width of the spatula is; and cut the two ends on two sides where you hold the threads; then join them both subtly above what exceeds the eyelid of the eye, and press the two hooks from both sides strongly; and leave it like this for some days, and the skin that is pressed will die and blacken and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with small scissors, then treat it until it is healed; and when the wound is healed, and the eyelid is lifted, and the hairs will not prick anymore; and this is the form of the two hooks that you will make according to this figure, and according to this length and width:
