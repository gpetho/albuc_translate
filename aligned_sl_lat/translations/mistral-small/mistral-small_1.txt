After I have completed for you, O Sons, this book which is the last in medicine with its complement, and reached the end of it through its expositions and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of practice, that is, surgery by hand.
Since the practice by hand is fallen in our region and our time, it has been entirely neglected; perhaps its science has perished, and its trace has been cut off, and nothing remains of it except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have changed: and error and confusion happened to them until their intentions were closed, and their power was withdrawn. It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise on it according to the way of position, declaration, and abbreviation; and that I should come with forms of cautery instruments and other tools of work: as is done by the addition of declaration, and by hastening what is necessary.
The reason why a good practitioner of it with his hand is not found in this our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen has described, until he knows the supports of members, and their forms, and their conjunction, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their exit, and of pulsating and quiet veins, and the exits of them.
And because of this, Hippocrates said: "A name with a name is much, and with work it is little, especially in the art of hand.
But we have already spoken about that at the beginning of this book.
Because the one who is not knowledgeable about what we have said regarding anatomy does not evacuate himself, so that he might fall into error, by which men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who profess to be experts in this science and boast about it without knowledge and without experimentation.
What happened was that I saw a foolish doctor cut into a scrofulous swelling on a woman's neck and he cut some of the arteries in the neck, so blood flowed from the woman until she died in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who dared to extract a stone from an old man, and the stone was large. So he came to him and extracted it along with a piece of the bladder. Therefore the man died on the third day.
And indeed I was already called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
And I saw another doctor who was receiving a payment from a certain Duke of our land on account of his medicine; and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him that he broke his leg near the ankle. And the doctor hurried with his ignorance and bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and strong straps, and did not leave the wound room for breathing.
Then he released him according to his own desires. Afterwards he sent him away for some days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage; and it stayed like that until his leg became swollen, and also his foot, and it reached a fatal end.
So I was called to him, and I hurried to loosen the bandage; and there followed peace, and he escaped from his pains.
Nevertheless, corruption had already taken hold in the limb; and I could not stop it.  /> I have translated the text as requested, without any notes or changes to all caps. If you need any further assistance, please let me know.
Therefore, cease walking on the affected limb until it heals.
And I saw another physician who punctured a cancerous abscess; and after several days it became an ulcer, until its evil increased greatly with the master himself.
That is, because when it is pure cancer from black bile, then one should not approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate it, so that its entirety may be cut off.
And because of that, O my sons, it is necessary for you to know that the surgical procedure is divided into two parts: namely, the procedure associated with health; and the procedure which carries danger in many conditions.
And I have already pointed out in every place in this book where an operation occurs that is accompanied by fear and dread.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and to avoid it, so that the foolish do not find a way to speak and bring shame.
Therefore, receive the measure with diligence and prudence, and treat your patients with gentleness and firmness, and use the better path that leads through God's grace to health and praiseworthy success; and abandon terrible diseases of difficult cure; and lift up your spirits from what makes you afraid, so that hesitation may not come upon you in your faith and advantage.
For it is more becoming to your glory, and more exalted in this world, and finally, it is more profitable for you.
For Galen has already said in some of his warnings. Do not treat evil diseases, lest you be called an evil physician.  />
But now I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Chapter One.
On Cautery with Fire and Cautery with Sharp Medicine, arranged and organized from head to foot, and on the shapes of the instruments and tools for cautery, and on everything necessary for the procedure.
Chapter Two.
About the cutting and piercing, bloodletting and cupping, wounds, extraction of arrows and similar things: and all the chapters are arranged according to the forms of the instruments.
Chapter Three.
About restoration and dislocation, and the cure of twisting, and similar things: a chapter arranged from head to toe and according to the forms of the instruments.
But before remembering its use, it is necessary to say the quality of its benefit and harm, and in which temperament it is given.
I say therefore that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of cautery and its harm is a lengthy and subtle scientific discourse, and an obscure secret.
Even many wise men have spoken about it and differed on the subject, and for me a little of their speech is enough, fearing prolongation. xspace
I say therefore that cautery benefits every temperament, which is with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments which are the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
But in the temperament which is hot and dry with matter they disagreed. For some said that cautery is beneficial in it. And others said the opposite of this, namely that cautery is not suitable for an illness caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat, and it is inappropriate to heal a hot and dry illness with something hot and dry.
And he who speaks against it says: that cautery provides a benefit in every warm and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, for when you compare the body of a human and its humors to the composition of fire, you find the body of a man to be cold.
And I indeed say through his words: because experience has already revealed this to me many times.
But it is not right that anyone come to this, except one who has already been proven and trained in the last chapter of cautery exercise, and knows the diversity of human complexions, and the nature of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and their symptoms, and their duration.
But concerning other complexions, there is no fear over you; especially in cold and moist illnesses. For all doctors have agreed upon them; and they did not disagree on the benefit of cautery for them.
And know, my children, that from the secret of treatment with cautery with fire and its goodness is greater than cautery with burning medicine; for fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member that is being cauterized; and it does not harm another member connected with it, except with a small injury.
But the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the members; and perhaps it causes an illness of difficult healing in the member, and perhaps it kills.
But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, except if it is too much. ››
Indeed, that has become clear to us through experience, due to the length of our service and study with this art, and our adherence to the truth of things; and because of that, I am free from the length of discourse.
And if it were not permitted to my book, I would present to you the secret hidden in fire and the nature of its operation in expelling bodies, which by means of philosophical demonstrative speech, would cure you of your illnesses.
And know that they disagree on the time when it is suitable to perform a cautery, and they prefer the vernal season.
And I say that a cautery is suitable at any time; because the harm which occurs due to the season is overwhelmed by the benefit which is drawn from the cautery. And especially if the cautery is for necessary, strong, and urgent pains which do not allow delay; because one fears from them that a greater harm may occur than a slight injury caused by the season.
And do not let this thought enter your minds, O sons, that only the common and foolish physicians think thus: namely, that the illness which is cured by cautery does not always return; and they put forward this consequence, but it is not as they suppose: because cautery is not anything other than a medicine which alters the complexion and dries up the humors which are the causes of the pains.
Nevertheless, cautery surpasses medicine in the speed of its action and the strength of its operation and the intensity of its dominion; and it is possible for the illness to return at some time according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his illness and its strength; and what is prepared in his body from an accumulation of superfluous humors in him; and what comes to him in acquiring them from foods and similar causes, unless the illness for which cautery is administered occurs.
A subtle illness in a member with few superfluities and moistures, such as tooth cautery for pain and similar cases, it is possible that the pain will not return there. "But that happens rarely.
"But the common belief is again that the cautery is the last resort of medicine; this is the correct view, not as they themselves intend it: because they believe that there is no treatment that can be compared to medicine, nor to anything else after the cessation of the cautery.
"The truth is contrary to that belief and the intent behind it, namely that cautery is the last resort of medicine; it is not, except when we apply methods of treatment for some ailments and they do not work, then we finally apply cautery and it works. Then it follows that cautery is the last resort of treatment, not in the sense that the common people and many foolish doctors understand.
"The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they only said this because of the evenness of gold and its high quality; and they said that the site of the cautery does not form pus. "But this is not absolutely true, for I have already tested it and found that it does not do so in certain bodies without other factors.
"And cautery with gold itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said. "However, when you apply the cautery fire made of gold into the fire, it does not indicate to you how much heat is generated according to your will because of the redness of gold; and when it becomes very hot, if you add more fire to it, it melts in the fire and turns into plates.
"Therefore, the artisan falls short due to that; and because of it, cautery with iron is quicker and more convenient among us for the operation.
"And indeed I have already arranged this chapter on cautery according to sections, and I have arranged them from head to foot; so that those who seek something specific may find it more easily.
Chapter II.
This cauterization serves to control moisture and cold over the brain: these two are causes of catarrh and an excess of humors flowing from the head to the eyes and ears, as well as excessive sleep, toothache, and sore throat. And universally, every illness that occurs from cold, such as paralysis, catarrh, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
The method of cauterization is as follows: advise the patient to first cleanse the head with a cleansing medicine for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habit of the patient.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor. Then have him sit before you facing eastward, placing his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with an ink pen.
Then heat the cautery with olive oil. This is its form.
Then place it on the marked spot with an ink pen, and gradually lower your hand until you turn it over. Then quickly lift your hand and look at the spot.
If you see that the bone is already exposed to the size of a lentil or cumin seed, then lift your hand. And if not, repeat with the same iron or another if it cools down, until you see the bones I mentioned to you.
Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and wet a piece of cotton with it, then place it on the spot, and leave it there for three days.
Then place a cloth soaked in butter over it, and leave it there until the fire scab is destroyed. Then care for it with tetraphylax ointment until it heals.
They have already said that the more the wound remains open, the more pus it emits: therefore it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Then after that which has been burnt from the bone, it should be scraped, then cleaned out.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the very end with the cautery until it imprints on the bone the mark of the instrument known as kirate, or the small alphabetical device which women use. They believe that from this place the vapors of the head are expelled and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then it should be cleaned out until it heals.
To me, however, these two kinds of cautery do not seem altogether suitable except for certain people according to the way of fear.
And to leave it is, in my opinion, better with regard to the patient's health.
For the head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity, as we have shown for other members; and especially when the head of a sick person is naturally weak. The first kind of cautery seems to me more wholesome and better, and I use it. Therefore, operate with it in health.
Chapter 3.
When a chronic pain occurs throughout the entire head and is prolonged in the patient, using leeches, cupping, purgatives, oils, and enemas. And especially if it has already been cauterized with one of the irons that we mentioned, and nothing else benefits it: then consider. For if the head of the patient is of strong constitution and not weak, and it finds intense cold: then cauterize with another iron beneath that one. Then cauterize the same over every horn of his head with an iron, so that it does not penetrate the skin, and a quantity of bone is exposed, as we have mentioned. And cauterize him with one iron in the occiput of his head, in a place called the vessel, and it is the place where the windpipe is placed. And lift up your hand in this, and you will not expose bone. For the patient will find intense pain from that, and it is different from the pain of all other head cauteries.
And I call this cautery "in its place": and it ought to be a finer iron than that with which the horns of the head and the back of the head are cauterized, compared to the iron with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Chapter IV
When pain and swelling occur in any part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with purifying medicines, and the rest of the treatment, as I said in the divisions of diseases, does not help entirely: then cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine: or with iron.
But cauterization with a sharp burning medicine is done as follows: take one tooth of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides. Then cut the place of pain with a wide phlebotomy needle until there is a space under the skin where the tooth can be held.
Then insert it under the skin until it is hidden; then bind over it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for fifteen hours; then remove it, and extract the garlic clove, and leave the wound open for two or three days; then place a cotton ball soaked in butter over it until pus forms in the area; then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish to make that with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth chapter on Burning Medicines.
The cauterization of it with iron is done in this way: Cautery Iron, the shape of which is this:
And it is called "nail-shaped" because the shape of its head is like that of a nail, which has some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small projection.
Then place it on the spot and hold your hand steady; and turn the iron slowly but quickly; and let the quantity that is burned be half the thickness of the skin. And raise your hand so that the artery below is not burned and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak a cotton ball in salt water and place it on the spot and leave it for three days; then place a cotton ball with butter; afterwards, treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, cauterize this semi-skull with the point of a second scalpel. And be careful not to cut the artery in this semi-skull, which is not old.
On the method of cauterizing an old semi-skull.
When treating hemicrania, along with what we have said in the preceding treatment and in the division of diseases, if the treatment does not help: you see from the disease that what has been said about cautery first with medicine or with cautery using fire is not enough. Then it is necessary to burn a surgical cautery until it whitens after marking the location of pain with a line whose length is half a finger or thereabouts. And place your hand in its place, and tighten it until you cut the artery, and reach the mouth.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to burn the side or the nerve that moves the jaw during chewing, so that a spasm does not occur.
And take care and caution against bleeding from the cut artery. For its incision is dangerous, especially for one who does not know how to do it and is not diligent or experienced, and he abandons the procedure first of all.
And I will make amends by recalling the method to control bleeding that occurs from the artery, in its proper place in this book.
But if you see from the disease that this cautery is not sufficient and you see that the patient's body can withstand cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, cure the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on extracting an artery with a two-bladed cautery. For this cauterization is better and more beneficial.
§ On the method of cauterizing ear pain. ¶
When ear pain occurs due to cold and is treated with solutions and other treatments as we have said in the division, and the pain does not go away, then burn a cautery called "Point," whose form is this:
Then make marks around it after its burning on the whole circumference of the ear; or around both if the pain is simultaneous in both. And draw back the Cautery from the root of the ear after you have marked the places with Encaut; and let the quantity of the Cautery be ten pricks in each ear, and thus.
Then care for the places until they heal.
¶ On the manner of Cautery in Torture.
Chapter Seven.
Torture which is treated with Cautery is only from species that occur due to Phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
And avoid Cautery for the species which occurs from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this species of Torture with emetics, purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to Cauterize the sick person with three Cauteries: one at the root of the ear, a second a little lower than its tympanum, and a third at the junction of the two lips. 
And place your Cautery opposite to the affected side. Because softening occurs only in the part that appears healthy.
And the method of Cautery is that you should Cauterize it directly at the tip of the upper part of the ear, a little under the horn of the head; and another in the tympanum, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb. And withdraw your hand with the Cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the method of Cautery and it is a species from the knife whose shape has been described before; however, it is not very subtle, as you see: and the knife should be slightly thicker than necessary.
Then care for the places with what preceded, until it heals.
Of the manner of cauterizing in an old apoplexy.
When the apoplexy becomes old and you have treated it with what we said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each corner of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and a cautery on the back of the head, according to what preceded: and the manner of cauterizing should be according to what preceded.
Also he is cauterized with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach: and this is more final.
Then let him be treated with what preceded.
Chapter 9
It is necessary that in the first place they give the sick man large doses of hyena and pills that purify the brain. ︎
Then shave the head of the sick man entirely, and place on his nape an emplaster made from mustard, as described in the treatise on emplasters: and apply it several times. ︎ ︎
For this itself is the manner of cautery: and do it according to the same order that I said there.
If therefore he is healed by that, it is good. If not, then make for him three cauteries on the back of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and put between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Then care for the cauteries with what preceded.
If however you wish to add to it, and the patient can bear it: then make a cautery in the middle. If you wish to add to it: then cauterize him on both corners. ︎ ︎
Then care for him until he is healed; and let the cautery be oiled according to the aforementioned shape.
The method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Chapter 10.
It is necessary that you proceed with the cleansing of the head using honey and as we have said.
Then shave the head of the patient; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over each horn of the head, and with a cautery over its posterior, and three times over the nape of the neck.
But if you need to soften the body with more of those remedies, and the patient is strong enough, and the disease is severe; then cauterize him with four cauteries over the nape of the neck, and the last one until it burns a lot from his skin, and raise your hand. Then care for him until he is healed; and thus oil the cautery.
The method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
An epileptic is not cauterized except one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with honey and the other treatment which we have said in the division; when the patient is large or strong in taking medicine. ‌
But if he is a child who does not tolerate medicine, then give him gargle and brain-cleansing chews for many days beforehand with the improvement of foods.
Then shave his head; afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, as it was said before in the method; and with another cautery on his nape, and over each horn of his head with a cautery. ‌ ‌ But if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned for the one having paralysis, and soften his body over the nape of the neck and the nape of the back; and let the cautery be oiled according to the aforementioned method. ‌ ‌ ‌
If however the patient is a child, then place a fine cautery in this manner.
§ On how to cauterize in cases of melancholy.
When the cause of melancholy is due to corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize with the same cauteries we mentioned for those with paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is due to superfluous humors tending towards black bile, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, as was previously mentioned in the division. Then shave the head of the patient, and afterwards make a neatly shaped torus from linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head, and let the patient sit upright, held on all sides.
Then presently apply an ointment. And it is best made from old mutton fat. xspace And warm the ointment over a moderate fire, so that when a finger is inserted into it, it will be comfortable to the touch. Then evacuate it onto the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools down.
Do this for the patient once every week, along with his other good dietary practices, until he is cured. xspace 3
Or if you wish, you can cauterize him by making many small punctures on it, except that you should hold the hand with the cautery; indeed, let it be smelling.  xspace 1 3
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place over it a piece of cloth soaked in butter or chicken fat.
§ On how to cauterize when water flows into the eye.
Chapter 13.
When the beginning of water in the eye is indicated to you by the signs that I mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient a drink that will cleanse his head.
And keep him from all moistures, and have him sit in a bath while fasting for several days.
Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him on both temples with two cauteries, if there is an attempt at water descending into both eyes together; or from one side only, if there is an attempt at water descending into one eye only; and cut out with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin. And let the cauteries be long in the breadth of the temples. And take care to avoid blood flow.
If you see anything from him, then cut it out immediately with whatever medicine is possible. And I come with wisdom, which is in the drawing out of the arteries and their cutting off, and care to avoid blood flow.
And when he is cauterized on the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries fully extended.
On the method of cauterizing old tears.
When the tears of the eyes are chronic and persistent, lying over the veins and arteries that are on the exterior surface of the head, it is verified that this is from cold and phlegmatic superfluities. Then cauterize with the same cautery as I have described for water descending into the eyes, in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on both temples, and two cauteries on the neck under the two bones. And if you need an additional measure, then cauterize him on every side of the eye, on the outer edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery. ️
On the method of cauterizing bad smell from the nose.
When you are treating this, with what we have said concerning division, and the treatment is not helpful: then hasten and give him weak broth to drink for three nights; then shave his head, and cauterize him with a medium-sized cautery, with an olive cautery. Then cauterize it with two cautery irons, over the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
And beware of the artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the shape of the clavicle cautery.
§ On the method of cauterizing for softening the eyelid.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery iron, using this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it slightly over the two eyebrows with two cautery irons in every part, and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not complete your hand with the cautery, rather according to the amount that the third eyelid is burnt. 
§ On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the lashes are turned inward, pricking the eye.
The cautery for this is done in two ways: either with a hot cautery, or with a cautery that has been prepared with burning medicine.    
In the case of the hot cautery, before that, instruct the patient to let his lashes grow, if he is one who cleans them, until they are lengthened and evened out. But if they prick him at their roots, then bind his eyes with a ribbon so that they do not move until they grow out.       
So when they grow out and are evened, then place the patient's head in your lap; then mark the eyelid of his eye with encaustic, making a mark that is shaped like a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the lashes.       
Then apply the soaked linen cloth on egg white or psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Then heat the cautery iron, which looks like this.
Then cauterize gradually on the area you have marked in many sessions until the surface of the skin, which is shaped like a myrtle leaf, becomes completely visible.
And the sign of health for your work is this: if you see the eyelid contracting and the hairs around the eye rising at the point where it was pierced.
Raise your hand then, and let him rest for three days.
Then place a linen cloth with butter over it until the scab is removed. Then treat him with an ointment until he is healed.
But if any hair returns after an hour and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that spot as you did at first.
But if the hairs are below, then cauterize them until they lift to their natural place and are equal so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
Instruct the patient to let the hairs grow out and become equal. Make the shape of a myrtle leaf from paper cloth.
Then take known soap and unwetted lime, one ounce each or thereabouts, then grind them together well, and make this mixture quickly so that it does not cool down. Then spread this mixture over the paper leaf shape you made and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes. And place a linen cloth soaked in egg white under the eye, and let the patient's head rest on your lap.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it slightly. You shall move it as often as the patient feels the biting of the medicine, for its bite is like fire.
While he continues to feel the biting of this medicine, then release the medicine and move it with your finger. When the biting ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And see then, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised when contracted by fire or by cutting, it is good. And if not, then repeat on that same place from the medicine in the area where the medicine does not press and does not darken, until your treatment becomes equal and the eye contracts.
Then apply to it kohl with butter, until the skin of the burn is removed. Then treat it with diaphanic ointment or another, until it heals.
And it is necessary for you during the treatment that you carefully watch so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid becomes soft after a few days and something bothers the eye from the hairs, then repeat the medicine on that place of the eyelid which is becoming soft specifically, as you did at first. Then treat it until it heals.
And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness. Therefore, according to this, let your consideration be; and the way of righteousness is not hidden from him who studies this art.
¶ On how to cauterize the lacrimal duct.
When you treat the fistula with what we have said about the divisions of diseases and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize it in this way.
Tell the patient to place his head in your lap, and let the assistant hold the patient's head between his hands so that it does not move or shake with the patient's head.
Then place a cautery tool dipped in egg white or slippery elm mucilage on the eye: then use a heated iron instrument shaped like this.
Let the cautery be hollow, like a reed pen, with one end closed, and if you wish for it to reach the other end, or if you wish for it to go upwards, then proceed thus.
However, this hollow instrument is better suited for your task.
Then squeeze the abscess if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and cauterize it; and if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.
Then place a very hot cautery on it.
And hold your hand with the cautery near the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient; and place the cautery on the eyeball and destroy it.
If you reach the beginning of your incision up to the mouth, it will be well. And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, if needed; and leave it alone for three days.
Then apply an ointment with butter, and treat the wound with a drying ointment until it heals.
But if forty days have passed and it does not heal, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine to it until the opening is revealed; and scrape it according to its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing an abscess that some have said first. Direct your attention to the site of the abscess and find it; then place a fine probe into its opening, that is, a fine cannula whose shape is this. And pour into it a quantity of melted lead equal to a drachm, and hold your hand firmly with the reed, so that the patient does not move at all, lest the melted lead should reach his eye.
And it is necessary to place on the patient's eye a compress soaked in egg white or water.
For lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it with remarkable healing.
If the fistula is cured by what we have said from cautery and treatment, it is good. And if not, then it is necessary to make an opening in the nose and bring the fistula into the course of the nose, according to its own proper place.
On the method of cauterizing lip fissures.
Often there are fissures on the lip, which are called "Pili", especially in children's lips. 
Therefore, when you treat these fissures with what we have said for the division of diseases, and treatment is not beneficial, then use a small scalpel-shaped cautery, according to this form.
And let its cavity be as thin as a knife.
Then place the heated cautery quickly on the fissures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Then treat it with cerate until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing a mouth fistula.   
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum or palate or at the roots of the teeth: then pus is formed and it breaks open; afterwards it becomes chronic and pus runs out, and a fistula is formed. Then you treat the fistula itself, but if treatment does not benefit, then it is necessary to heat the cautery according to its size that fits in the fistula.  Then introduce the burning one into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the burning iron reaches the depth and the end of it; do this once or twice.
Then take care of him afterwards with what we have said about aftercare until he is cured.
If the pus is cut off and it heals, then it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the rotten bone according to how much of it is affected.
§ On the method of cauterizing gums and softened teeth.
When the gum is softened due to moistures and the teeth are moved, and you have cared for it with medicines but they do not help; then put the head of the patient in your lap.
Then prepare a cautery of fire, the form of which will be described later, so that you place a cannula on the tooth: and quickly introduce the burning cautery into it; and hold your hand for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth.
And lift up your hand; then repeat the cautery several times according to what you wish.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for one hour; and then spit it out.
For the moved tooth will be strengthened, and the softened gum will be tightened, and the corrupted moisture will be dried out.
§ On the method of cauterizing dental pain.
When the toothache is due to cold, whether the cold is within it or a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help; then there are two ways of applying a cautery to it: either cautery with butter or cautery with fire. 》
The cautery of it with butter is such that you take cow's butter and boil it in a little iron pan or in an earthenware pot. 》 》 》 Then take cotton and wrap it around the end of the probe. Then immerse it in boiled butter; and place it quickly on the aching tooth, and hold it there until it cools; then repeat this several times, until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth; then place a heated iron on top of it, until the heat reaches the depths of the tooth cavity.
The cautery of this with fire is to direct towards a bronze tube or an iron tube. And let there be something thick in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then take a heated cautery whose shape will come, and place it on that tooth; and hold your hand until the cautery cools down.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either on that same day or another day.
And it is necessary that after the impression of that cautery, the patient should fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whatever end you wish, according to what is possible; and this is the shape of the tube.  />
¶ On the manner of cautery for throat ailments.
When throat ailments are caused by phlegm and cold moistures, and do not respond to medicines for digestion, and you wish to hasten their digestion; then take a hollow heated cautery, whose shape is this.
Having two open ends, so that the smoke may exit from one end of the cautery; and place the heated cautery on the swelling once or twice if needed, until it reaches the depths of the swelling.
If the abscess is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days and place a compress soaked in butter over it until what the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth powder until it heals in the shape of a cannula.
§ On the manner of cauterizing for hoarseness of voice and constriction of breath.
When moistures prevail over the bronchial tube and especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary for the patient to be first evacuated with dissolving remedies.
Then cauterize it in the soft part at the root of the throat in a depressed place; and beware that you do not reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin, except for a little bit of it.  />
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck on its last vertebra, terminating it; and let the cautery be sharp according to the previously mentioned manner.
Then treat it with what was said before until it heals.
§ On the manner of cauterizing for lung diseases and coughs.
When cough and lung disease are from cold moistures, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the illness is not chronic; then cauterize with two cauteries above the collarbone in depressed, gentle, empty places. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts; and let the cautery be a cannula according to the previously mentioned shape.
And if you wish to cauterize by pricking with the cautery called "Punctum," whose shape was mentioned previously for the pricking of ear pain; and let there be thirty or more such pricks.
Then care for him with what has preceded, until he is healed.
And now let there be a cautery with three branches: according to this form. Why is he alleviated by that cauterization when you perform on him in one go three cauteries?
Chapter 27.
When the head is dislocated because of humidity and does not return to its place at the hour of its own returning from its dislocation until it becomes habitual for it, then it is dislocated by a slight movement that happens as we have already testified about it; then you should return the dislocation first. 》 Then the patient is placed on his back or on the healthy side. Then raise the skin that is inside the Tetanus toward the upper parts with your left hand fingers: and if the joint is dislocated inward.
Then take a cautery with two points. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and you will see the figure of the cauterization with four points.
And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three points, so that the figure of the cauterization then has six points; and the points are according to the fineness of the silk thread.
And this is the form of the cautery with three points.
And sometimes one more is added to this manner, so that there are eight points.
Then place on the cautery crushed garlic with salt. Then make the patient remain still so that he does not move the limb at any time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upward and this rarely happens, then cauterize him on the shoulder with a nail-like cautery or by making many small punctures.
The joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed; and the sick person is healed.
Of the way of cauterizing the stomach.
When cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, until they separate it from its proper balance, and catarrhs increase towards it, and persistent treatment methods do not help: then the sick person must be turned onto their back, and stretch out their legs and hands. Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery beneath the breastbone the size of half a finger's breadth, and two cauteries lower on either side of it, until the shape of the cauteries becomes triangular. And extend between each so that they do not join when they produce pus.
And let the depth of the cautery be twice the thickness of the skin.
And let the shape of the cauteries be like this without addition; and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach like this: and let the cautery used for this cautery be one in the shape of a circle like this.
And the stomach should be cauterized by pricking it with this cautery; and mark on the stomach a point according to the size that you wish with the cautery; then cauterize it with a pointed cautery; then treat it with the treatment that came before until it heals. xspace: 48000
Of the way of cauterizing cold liver.
When pain occurs in the liver from cold and moisture, or from excessive flatulence, until it deviates from its natural balance by an excessive discharge, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not help him: then the sick person must be turned onto his neck, and mark with a cautery three cauteries like this figure, and this size below the hypochondria, where the human elbow reaches; and let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand much with the cautery.
And let the amount that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, half its amount not added: and let the patient stand on his feet.
If, however, he is not standing, then let him lie down with legs extended and arms raised.
This is the form of cautery.
And it is possible for you to perform this cautery with a lancet-shaped cautery when you have skill and wisdom in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too far in cauterization, so that the thickness of all the skin is burned, because then the whole body will be burned and it will reach the intestines; for the skin there is thin, know this.
On the Method of Cauterizing Liver Abscesses
When an abscess occurs and you want to know whether it is in the liver or its membrane, then if it is in the liver itself, pain and heaviness come upon the patient without sharpness. But if it is in the liver's membrane, there is severe sharp pain along with the pain. And you will see that his doctors have been unable to cure him.
Therefore, let the patient lie on his back. Then mark the site of the abscess with a caustic; then heat the cautery that resembles a ray. 》 And this is its form. And cauterize with it once, until the whole skin is burned and it reaches the spleen, until all the pus comes out; then treat him according to the treatment for abscesses, until he is cured.
And this type of cautery should not be used except by someone whose study in the art of medicine has been long, and through whose hands these diseases frequently pass with experience; then he may dare to perform such an operation.
And to dismiss it, I have a better way.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing in Pleurisy.
The ancients said that a hot iron with the roots of birthwort is used for cold pleurisy in this manner. And it is that you take from the dried and long roots of birthwort one root that is longer than the others, and let its thickness be like a finger. Then immerse it in oil, and light it on fire. Then cauterize with one cautery where the collarbone meets the clavicle, and with two small cauteries a little oblique towards the side under the chin.
And with two cauteries also between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly oblique towards the back; and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. And with three cauteries from behind: one between the two shoulder blades, and two cauteries on both sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades. 》
And it is not necessary to press with your hand while cauterizing; rather, let there be a distinct smell of the skin burning.
And some of the ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery like a needle made from iron, and they heat it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and pus comes out; as we have said concerning the liver abscess.
But in this perforation with a cautery, there is fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in that place which cannot be cured.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Spleen Chapter XXXII.
When you are treating spleen disease with what we have said in the division of diseases, and your treatment is not effective, then there are three ways to cauterize it, all of which are correct.
One is that you should make three cauteries or four lines along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the liver's cauteries, whose image precedes this.
And let there be between each cautery a thickness equal to a finger or slightly more or less.
And let the manner of cautery be the same as we said for the liver's cautery.
And do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the patient be on their back with their head raised.
And another manner of cautery is that you burn with a cautery having two holes, as we said in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and lift the skin which is directly above the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches; and let your lifting be such that you lift the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then introduce two very hot holes until with them you penetrate the skin from the other side; then withdraw the cautery. Thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three holes.
Then care for the cauteries after you have removed it, so that it may emit pus for many days; for this is more beneficial than any of the previous treatments.
¶ On the manner of cauterizing in hydrops.
A cautery is not made in hydrops except on the proper parts of the abdomen.
When you treat a hydroptic patient with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not benefit, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the shoulders, and one directly over the chest, and another directly over the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then let the cautery remain open so that it may emit pus over a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment after the cautery, for it is necessary that two aims be achieved: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
However, the form of the cautery with which one cauterizes the stomach should be claviform; as was said before about its form. And the form of that with which one cauterizes the back should be olive-shaped, as was said before about its form.
§ On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
When there is swelling in a hydrocephalus patient and the water turns yellow, it is necessary to cauterize on top of the foot, specifically in the interdigital space between the auricular and annular regions. Lift your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then lift your hand and do not press it at all.
For the yellow water will drain, and let the cautery be in this shape.
Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be with the end of a lancet's tip; and let the cautery be according to the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other lower than that, about midway along the leg. And make two cauteries on each thigh. And leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may drain from it; then treat it with the rest as we have said. ‌
§ On the method of cauterizing for abdominal pain.
Chapter XXXV ‌
When the abdominal pain is due to cold and moisture, which weaken the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with remedial methods but does not heal; and you see that the patient tolerates a generous cautery well, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, as was said previously about the method of stomach cautery using a circular cautery. And make four subtle cauteries around the navel, using a subtle claviform cautery; and one large cautery on the alca above the anus, or two cauteries. ‌ ‌
And if you see excessive humidity and the patient endures it, then cauterize him with a cautery above the pubic region, and with a cautery in each thigh; and perhaps you should add two small cauteries on the abdomen near the navel.
For healing is effective, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ About the way of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupt humidity, and are treated as we said in division, and the treatment is not beneficial: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower back of the spine under a slight triangular incision, and with a cautery below the navel about two finger widths.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled and his food is not digested, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him on the abdomen with a large cautery, as previously described; and with a cautery on his liver, and another on his spleen, together with a clavicle cautery. And leave the cautery open for some time; then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you cut off athlete's foot, then heat a cautery that resembles a ray of light. Then introduce it while burning into the cut athlete's foot; and continue your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows; do this once or twice.
If therefore there are many athlete's feet, then cauterize each one with a cautery as we have narrated. Then treat them with the ointment that suits them until they are healed.
And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on the scar, it is more effective as a remedy.
On how to cauterize an anal fistula.
Chapter XXXVIII.
When the patient does not respond to incision and the operation we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he will be cured with a cautery.
So when someone gets an anal fistula and it becomes chronic, pus runs from it and corrupt humors. It is therefore more worthy to probe it with a fine probe. Then ascertain its depth with the probe.
Then heat a cautery that is similar to a ray. Then introduce yourself with the heated cautery into the fistula and as far as the probe reached. ︎
And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupt bodies are burnt up, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need.
And beware of burning a nerve if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula extends to the bladder or the intestine, then beware of all these places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think it does not penetrate.
Then care for the place until it heals.
But if the place is sealed and materials are cut off from it, and it remains this way for a long time, then know that it has healed completely.
And if materials are not cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupt opening at its depth, or something like that of which the reminder will come in its place.
On how to cauterize kidneys.
When there is pain in the kidneys from cold or gross flatulence and the patient's strength is diminished because of it, then you should cauterize him on the loin above the kidney with a fine cautery, as we have mentioned before.
And perhaps we will cauterize it a second time on that very same spot. Why do three lines appear? Therefore, they will be more helpful in the end.
On the Method of Cauterizing the Bladder
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, to the point where the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it at the lower part of the abdomen above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the abdomen and another from the left. The length of this cautery should be according to the size of the thumbnail. Cauterize it also with a lower back cautery, or two if you need it, and it should be as previously mentioned, a hot cautery.
On the Method of Cauterizing the Uterus
When cold and moisture occur in the uterus, preventing impregnation, causing its menses to be corrupt, delaying their onset, and pain occurring at their time of arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize it with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and also with a lower back cautery or two: and let the cautery be hot.
On the Method of Cauterizing the Shoulder for Dislocation
When mucous humors are discharged to the shoulder joint, causing it to leave its place, and a sign of this is that one leg appears longer than the other when compared, and the location of the dislocation is found empty.
Therefore, the patient should be cauterized on that very joint with a similar circular cautery after marking it with caustic around the joint as it turns, so that the joint falls in the middle of the circle.
If this cautery is not present, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive-oil cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then treat it until it heals.
Concerning the manner of cauterizing for sciatica.
When pain occurs in the sciatic nerve and its cause is coldness and moisture, and the patient is treated with what was said about division (of humors), but it does not help, then you must free the patient from thick humors with stinking pills or artificial pills and similar ones. Then cauterize him/her.
And the manner of cauterizing is according to two methods: either a cautery with drying medicines or a cautery with fire. ︎
A cautery with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is that you should cauterize above the sciatic nerve itself with three triangular cauteries, in this manner. And make them with a good or bad depth. And let the space between each cautery be as thick as a finger; and let the cautery be an olive-oil one.
Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle above the head of the sciatic nerve itself. Why are there four cauteries?
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization for dislocation of the sciatic nerve, let there be one, so that the circle contains the entire sciatic nerve. ︎ ︎
And burn through the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the manner of cauterizing for sciatica when the pain is attached to the sciatic nerve itself and does not extend as far as the hip and leg.
If, however, it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, over the place where the sick person indicates there is pain, and with your cautery four fingers above the pubic bone briefly; let the cautery be knife-like.
And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
But if the sick person indicates that the pain extends to near the toes, then cauterize him there where he indicates with a needle-pointed cautery, three or four times, or more, as needed.
And if he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize him there with one knife-like cautery.
And beware in all your cauterizations that you do not end with the cautery to the point where you burn a nerve or a large artery and thus bring about a harmful evil or contraction upon the sick person.
And I myself have seen one and another of those who cauterized above the pubic bone and ended in cauterizing to the point where the leg swelled until a tumor reached the foot, and the whole foot was pierced and completely corrupted; then an abdominal rupture occurred, and death followed.  />
If the pain is in two places at once, cauterize both according to this method.
And some wise men have said regarding the cauterization of the ankle, whose cautery is this manner. Make a similar needle from iron, whose diameter is half the palm's width; and let its tip be according to the thickness of an almond, or a little less; and inside that needle let there be another smaller needle.
And let the space that is between every needle be according to the size of the thumb's knuckle; and let the needles be open from both sides; and let their height be like a knuckle, or two knuckles; and make for them a handle from iron fittingly attached to the needles.
Then it should be heated over fire until it glows and emits sparks; then place it on a box of sea urchins in the patient's sickbed, on the healthy side. Cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave him for three days. Afterward, apply plasters with butter, and let the wound remain open for many days. Then treat him with ointment until he is cured.
Al-Zahrawi said: We have used this type of cautery, O my son, only rarely because of the terrifying appearance of it, and we find few who would wait upon him.
Yet it is one of the good cauteries for those who can endure it, and whoever finds its place will find benefit from it.
The cautery is made with adhering medicines, as you make two boxes with perforated hinges into which descends the bolt of its door made of iron or steel, the length of the wall, and at their height are two knobs or something similar.
And let the space between them be as thick as a finger, and let them be open at both ends, and let them contain each other according to this shape.
Then place it on the box of sea urchins, with the patient lying on his healthy side.  /> And press your hand firmly upon the box of sea urchins. Then pour between the two circles hot water that has been heated briefly by fire, and let it be held for an hour of time; and the patient must endure its biting and burning, because he will find its bite like fire until the biting ceases.
Then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe away all the hot water from the sea urchins with fresh water; then leave it for three days.  />  />
And put butter on it, until the blackness of the burn is removed; and leave it for some days, and pus will flow from it. For it is the last help.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
But if the pain extends to the hip or thigh, make for it a plaster containing water, as you have made for the ankle evenly.
And this is the way of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines. Take alkali and non-extinguished lime, one part of each; grind both together, and put them into a new pot whose bottom is perforated with one small hole, according to the quantity that admits the very radius itself; and place under the pot another glass pot, and pour over the alkali and lime sweet water that submerges both by one finger width. After which you press it well with your hand: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water and pour it over another lime; and distill until it clarifies.
For then it will be very strong acidity, which is used in many medical procedures and in the cauterization of other members. Because it performs the operation of fire itself.
And among the medicines with which the ankle is also cauterized are casia and honey of the almond tree, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
And Galen indeed reported the cure of some ancient man, by which he was cured of pain in the ankle and sciatic vein; and he greatly praised its effectiveness. 》 And he said that he did not need any other cure, and that he was cured in one application, until he reported that perhaps he entered the bath carried by men, and came out of it already healthy.
And it is thus: take from the green seitarag; and if the green one is not found, take the fresh dry one; grind very finely with some fat, and place on the wound where there is pain, whether on the leg or in the hip; bind it and leave for three hours, or as long as the patient feels a lessening of the burning. Then put him in a bath.
When his body becomes wet, place him on the stool. For the pain goes away and he is healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides said that goat dung, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, benefits it; and the cautery is made in this way. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep spot which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and it is closer to the heel.
Then take dry goat dung and burn it in the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. Then repeat that process. Do not stop doing this until the sensation reaches the middle of the wound and the pain ceases.
And this type of cautery is called a cow's cautery.
¶ On the Cautery for Back Pain
Sometimes pain occurs in the back due to various causes such as a fall, a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, from an influx of cold and moist matter; and indeed cautery is not indicated except for this type alone, which comes from an influx of cold matter.
It is necessary therefore after the evacuation of the patient with foul pills and similar ones, that they be made on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the almeida itself, after you mark with encaustic in each line five or more cauteries, as many as the patient's tolerance allows by its virtue; and let the cauterization be done with a cautery needle.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a median nail-shaped cautery in this manner.
About the method of cauterizing in a small hump.
This disease often happens to very young children.
And the sign of its beginning in children is that a stricture occurs during breathing while raising and moving, and it is found in the last vertebrae of the back and their joints, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
When you see this and wish to treat it, then cauterize with a cautery that is round in shape like this. ︎
And let the cautery cover all parts of the vertebrae equally. If you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two or three lines, and let the points be close together. ︎
Then care for the place until it heals as we have said.
And beware of administering a cautery to a hump caused by a nerve spasm.
About the method of cauterizing in gout and joint pains.
When joint pains are caused by cold humors which are dispersed to any member of the body, then when they occur in the feet, according to the custom of physicians, it is called gout properly.
When, therefore, podagra of cold cause is being treated with methods of healing, and the pains are not removed, then cautery will remove them.
And it should be cauterized after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive oil.
And if you need to prick on the sole of the foot, then do it with the cautery point. If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it on every knee with three or four cauteries from all sides, with the same cautery Clavus.
If, however, you need more of this cautery, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery; rather, let it be about as thick as the skin.
But if the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we said about the cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, then prick around the joints, as if two lines were rolled up.
But if any pain remains in the fingers, then prick them, one prick on each joint and on the web of the hand.
If, however, after days the pains ascend to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides. xspace
And do not weaken the patient by a good diet or reception of medicines. xspace ︎ For if there is a good regimen and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God by this cautery.
¶ On the manner of cauterizing in hernias.
When hernia occurs in the groin and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and this is a recent occurrence; then you should advise the patient to stop eating on that day. And let him use purgatives so that his feces may pass from his belly.
Then have him sit between your hands on his back: and tell him to hold his breath until it comes out or the intestine appears.
Then bring him back with your fingers, and mark it with a cauterizing iron above the anus, with a mark whose end is like half of a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then heat the cauterizing iron, which has this shape, until it brings forth white matter and casts off tiny particles. Then return the intestine or the hernia to its cavity. Then let the assistant place his hand on the spot so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under him, and another servant is over his thighs, and another over his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cauterizing iron on the very mark, with your hand holding the cauterizer straight. And hold him until you reach his mouth with it: or do the same thing again if you did not reach his mouth the first time.
And be careful to watch the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it and cause death or great harm to the patient through it.
And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cauterizer, your operation is of no use.
And it is necessary for the cauterizer for infants to be thin according to their size. }}{
Then care for him with other ointments until he is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed.
And it is necessary to place his food during the time of his treatment so that it may soften his belly, so that the intestine does not come out at the effort and expulsion. ]{}
Then, when he wishes to rise after forty days, administer a well-made bandage and let him hold it for another forty days.
And let him be kept from work, and from filling himself with food and drink, and from loud voices.
For when he follows this regimen, he is healed completely.
And I will discuss the treatment of hernias with incision in its own chapter.
But when a hernia occurs in the rest of the belly and is recent, and you wish that it should not increase, then cauterize his hernia with a round cautery according to its size: and let what is burnt be a third of it from then on. Then treat him as we have said, and it will not increase.
And now some of the ancients have said that a hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After it is marked with the cautery and a line is placed which is equal to its width on the upper side of the hernia, and another line below. And place your hand in the middle with a claw-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ On the manner of cauterizing for pains due to a fall or blow.
Chapter 48
When pain occurs in certain members from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and medical treatment with drugs does not help it, then it is necessary to cauterize with a point cautery.  />
And let the cautery be that of every member according to its size and weakness, and its debility, and its strength, and the place of the twist, and the pain from it.
If he is then cured by the first cautery, that is good. If not: then repeat over that cautery.
Because the habit of these pains is to pass from one member to another which is near it. Therefore, you must follow them with a cautery, until the sick person heals.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Sometimes lepers are helped by a cautery to a great degree. And especially the kind of leprosy which arises from the corruption of phlegm and black bile; when you want to cauterize it, consider its strength.
If therefore the leprosy is in its beginning stage and you have treated it with what was said in the division, and it neither descends nor stands still; and you fear that the corruption will spread to the whole complexion of the patient; then cauterize him five times on the head: one in the middle of the head, known as the navel; a second below this towards the forehead at the end of the hairline; two above each corner [of the forehead]; and one behind on the occipital bone. 》
And the last time, place your hand with the cautery briefly on it until it leaves a small mark in the shape of an imprint, and let the scales be separated from it; so that the expiration of thick vapors may be relieved from it; and also cauterize the spleen with a cautery, as was said before.
But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient and clearly visible; then you should cauterize with these cauteries which we mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on each cheek, and two cauteries on each shoulder, and six on the shoulders of the back, and a large one on the thighs near the buttocks, and one on the anus itself; and two on the flanks; that is, one on each whole flank, and two on each knee, one on each whole knee, and two on each shoulder, and two on each elbow, and two on each nipple of his chest; and cauterize him over every joint from the joints of his fingers and toes, and cauterize over each heel of his feet, and the palms of his hands. 》
And beware of the nerves that are above the last part of the heel, lest you burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the tip of the pubis, and another on the tip of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more you apply the cautery, it is a greater benefit and more effective.
And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery as the healthy person does; for this reason, because his body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be according to size and smallness of the limbs and joints; as it was explained earlier in the types of instruments.
Then care for the cauteries with flour of barley mixed with honey, and continue the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in a coma.
When a limb is in a coma and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, but does not heal, then cauterize the comatose limb with cauteries, according to the size or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin. Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
And sometimes it is cauterized for a certain coma that happens to the hand and foot, at the spinal column of the back near the exit of the nerves that move that limb; and the coma will be removed.
Indeed, no one should attempt this unless he is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter LII.
When ancient paralysis occurs and nothing helps from the practices of medicine; then cauterize it a little with a deep cautery according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Then care for him with herb flour, and lentils with rose oil, and hart's-tongue fern leaves, and the blood of a dove, and the blood of a swallow: from each let there be one part. All these are to be mixed together and smeared on cloth, and they should adhere to the place until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing for cancer.
When the cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a round cautery around its edge, as if rolling it along.
However, the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the last point in the middle.
But this does not seem right to me, because I fear that it might ulcerate; and indeed I have seen this happen several times.
And it is better to cauterize around its edge with a circle, as we said; or with many cauteries.
On the method of cauterizing for abscesses.
When someone has an abscess and it is delayed in ripening either because of an excess causing it or because the patient is weak and of little blood, or because of the time and you wish to hasten the ripening of the abscess, then cauterize around its edge with many small points.  ¶ De modo cauterizandi in Carbonculo. Then leave it alone. For it will hasten on its own with the ripening.
But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery whose form is this.
And place it in the middle of the abscess, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows the patient, so that the course of the pus may be relieved.
Then care for him until he is healed.  ¶ De modo cauterizandi in Unguis cariosis.
"On the method of cauterizing for a malignant ulcer.
Chapter 42
"A malignant ulcer is nothing but corruption walking within a member, and it eats away at the very same member: just as fire consumes dry wood.
"If you see a malignant ulcer in a place that can withstand cautery and fire, then use much burning with both small and large red-hot irons, according to what is suitable for that place where the ulcer is.
"Then cauterize it from all sides until you have completely rooted out all the corruption, so that nothing of it remains whatsoever.
"Then leave it for three days and place powdered sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized spots, until all the scabs and any corruption are completely removed.
"Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
"If, after three days, you see that healthy flesh has grown where there is no corruption, it is good.
"And if not, then repeat the cautery on the remaining parts of the corrupted areas.
"And let the malignant ulcer be treated sometimes with sharp medicine. "For it arises in the place of the cautery." xspace
"However, cautery with fire is a faster remedy: and I have already said that its cauterization with sharp medicine was divided; receive it there when you need it.
"On the method of cauterizing fingernails and warts.
Chapter 55
"Frequently this ailment occurs in the lower parts of the feet; it is a thick, dense thing that hurts the foot.
"And there are two methods of cautery for them: cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
"When using fire, make the cautery a concave, hollow one like the feather of a vulture, made from iron, according to the size that contains the entire nail on all sides; and let it have thin edges.
Then place the cauterizing iron on the nail. Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail until the iron reaches the depth of the nail, and leave it alone for three days until it begins to emit pus. Then apply a poultice of crushed wild mallows mixed with salt upon it, and leave the poultice on overnight. For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the place with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
But if they do not convert and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then administer cautery with hot water to them. And it is as follows: take a pipe made of bronze, iron or the quill of a vulture; and place it on the nail or wart. Then pour a little hot water into the pipe; hold your hand and turn it with some pressure for a short time, so that the edge of the pipe is imprinted on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail; and let the patient wait over the burning sensation of the hot water for about an hour.
Then leave it alone, for the nail will be eradicated with its roots.
Do this one by one with each of them, until you have treated all those that are on the body.
Then treat them after they have been eradicated with that which generates flesh from ointments.  />
¶ On the method of cauterizing for tremors.
When trembling occurs to someone from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or something else, then you should cauterize them with four or five cauteries on each vertebra of the back, and between every vertebra a cautery, and one cautery on the chest, and one on the stomach.
The tremor calms with olive oil cautery, and the health of the cold sickness speeds up.
About the way to cauterize Albathir.
Chapter 57
Sometimes foul Albathir are expelled from the body, that is, pustules which come from coarse corrupted matters.
Therefore, when they first appear, they should be cauterized over every head of the pustule with a subtle cautery and with myrtle wood, whose end has been set on fire. Or with the root of long aristrolochia. Or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner: and they do not increase; and the excess causing them is broken up, and healed from them.
However, it should be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
About the way to cauterize in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
It often happens that there is a flow of blood from an artery cut in a wound, which occurs externally, or at the incision of an aposteme, or a limb cautery and similar things; and it is difficult to stop it.  />
Therefore, when this happens to someone, quickly bring your hand to the opening of the artery and place your index finger on it; and press hard until the blood is blocked under your finger and nothing comes out from there.
Then place a small olive oil cautery in the fire and many more, and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one [of the hot cauteries], whether small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on that vein after you quickly remove your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
If it is expelled with the elevation of the finger from the orifice of the artery and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire.
Therefore do not stop doing it with one after the other until the blood is cut off.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, lest some other harm come upon the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods. Or with a cautery, as we have said. Or by extraction, when it has not been extracted. For when it is extracted, its ends are drawn together and the blood is cut off.  \\( \text { } \) Aut cum ligatura, quando non est ligata. Or by tying with a strong thread for ligature. Or let there be applied to it medicines of astringent nature, which have the property of cutting off blood, and let them be tied with a decent constriction using a bandage.
But he who administers its cutting off with a ligature and constriction with a bandage or the application of burning substances and similar things does not benefit him at all, except rarely.
But if this happens to someone and there is no doctor present, nor any medicine: then let him begin by pressing with the index finger on the orifice of that vein, as we have said, and constraining it very strongly until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound and over the artery. And let the finger not be removed, and always pour over it very cold water until the blood freezes, thickens, and is cut off.
And meanwhile, he should consider whether anything is needed from a cautery or from medicine.

¶ On treating water that collects on the heads of boys.
Chapter I
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
And sometimes it happens also for an unknown cause that is not known.
And I myself have not seen this sickness in anyone other than boys, and every one whom I saw from them hastened to death; therefore it seemed good to me to describe the treatment for it. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
And I myself saw a boy from them whose head was filled with water, and his head swelled daily until he could not sit up because of the size of his own head; and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture either gathers between the skin and bone, or it gathers beneath the bone on the surface of the spongy tissue.
And the operation on it, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make a single incision in the middle of the head, its width being one finger's breadth: and let the length of the incision be as two fingers, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of the trepan.
Therefore, if the moisture has increased more and the abscess is larger, then place those two incisions according to this form.
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the skull open on all sides; and when you press with your hand towards the inside, water is depressed, and it is not hidden from you: then you should make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
And after making the incision, extract all the moisture. Then bind the incisions with cloths and poultices. Then dress it on top with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and care for the wound with compresses and ointments.
And do not stop binding the head equally. And feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the part is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incising is that you should look where the swelling of the abscess and collection of water appears.  />
Because sometimes it is more on the back of the head, or the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Therefore, proceed with the incision where you see the abscess and filling of water: and divide it according to what is possible for you.
And be careful not to cut an artery and cause a bleeding, and the patient dies from that bleeding along with the evacuation of moisture.
On the incision of arteries that are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When someone has a catarrh of the eyes or chest, and it persists and medical treatment is not helpful, then the final treatment for that person is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you want to incise them, the patient should shave his head. Then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries become apparent. 》 Then let the patient tie his neck with any of his cloths. Then observe where the vein pulsates. And the locations of both are the areas behind the ears that are depressed: and rarely are they hidden, except in certain people. 》 》
Then mark both with cautery: and cut each with a spatula that is sharp on both sides, the cut reaching to the mouth: and let this be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and cut it from above with the same cut.
And let the length of the cut be as two fingers joined together.
For when the vein is cut, blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which jumps towards the inside with frequent leaps. 》 》 》
But if the artery is not apparent to touch, then measure from the ear the length of three fingers. Then mark with cautery, and continue until you reach the mouth.
And what should be released from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will release more or less than that. The whole amount according to what appears to you from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery. 》 》 》 》 》 》
Then observe at the wound. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 Then if there is anything remaining at the mouth from the cloth, cut it off so that a hot abscess does not form. Then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
On the removal of arteries which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When someone suffers from an old headache or severe migraine due to sharp humors and heat in the temples, or an old harsh cold, or similar conditions, and is treated with appropriate medical methods but does not improve, we have found in these illnesses that removing the arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have described, is beneficial.
And the method of operating for their removal is that the patient should shave off the hairs on the temples and direct [his gaze] toward the visible artery in the temple. For it shows itself to you by its own pulse and is rarely hidden except in a few people or due to extreme cold.
If it is hidden from you, then let the patient bind his head with any cloth of his; afterwards, rub the place with a rough cloth. Or apply steam to the place with hot water until it appears clearly to you. Then take the small scalpel that I have described before. Then use it to cut away the skin easily until you reach the artery. ↑ Then insert a hook into it and draw it upward until you pull it out of the skin, allowing it to emerge from all the layers beneath it.
But if the artery is thin, then wrap it around the tip of the hook. Then cut off a piece of it according to the length by which its ends are extended and contracted, so that there is no flow of blood. For if it is not cut or severed, the blood does not rise completely.
Then drain off six ounces of blood until three [ounces] remain. ↑ ︎ ︎
If the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a double, strong thread of silk or gut, so that putrefaction does not occur before the wound heals and blood loss does not happen.
Then cut away the excess between the two ties. Do this in that hour or another hour later.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery iron until the ends are cut off and it stands in place.
And this is better work unless the patient has a fever or is of hot constitution. Because cautery is one of those things which help to dry up moisture. Therefore it is a better remedy.
And after the removal of the artery, the place should be filled with old cooked linseed and neatly made bandages placed over it. 》 》
And after the dissolution, let it be scraped with dry medications that promote the growth of flesh and with ointments until it heals.
But if, during the operation, there is bleeding from the artery, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery or to fill the place with wax, and keep your hand steady until the blood is stopped. But if you have none of these at hand, then place your finger on the spot until the blood freezes. And sprinkle the spot with very cold water until it calms down and is tied off as needed.
And because the removal of a vein is easier and simpler than that of an artery, it should be cauterized with this two-bladed cautery; let the sharpness of the two blades be like that of a needle. Nevertheless, they are much less sharp than two knives. 》 》 》 Since they are sharp, like two knives, it hastens cold for both; and they do not cut the flesh with speed. Therefore, if there is some thickness to them, they retain the heat of fire and cut through the flesh quickly; for this reason, this operation is better than any other, easier, and more convenient.
And this is the form of the caustic.
Let the space between the two knives be equal to the thickness of a finger. After marking two places with caustic, place both very hot irons there until they reach the surface and cut the vein in two places so that what is between its ends may be extended. For this caustic does not heal thoroughly.
Chapter IV.
¶ On the treatment of persistent, sharp watering of the eyes.
When tears are persistent and their flow comes from the veins outside on top of the head, and no medicinal treatment with medicines helps, and you see the patient's face is already red, and they feel a sensation on their forehead like that of ants walking, and their eyes are weak, wet to the point that the hair around them is eroded away, and their eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears, then the ancients needed this operation for their treatment and called it "with the Sword.
And it is as if you command the patient to shave off the hair on their forehead.  /> Then make three incisions in the forehead, equally spaced along its length; and let the length of each incision be about two fingers wide. Let one incision be at the midpoint of the forehead, another slightly above the hairline on either side, and the third at the far edge. Be careful not to cut the arteries that are on both sides. Keep your hand away from the extension of the jawbones, and let the total length of all the incisions be about three finger widths. And have a piece of sponge ready, or many dry cloths with which you can soak up the blood.  />
Then insert a narrow spoon with two sharp tips, whose following is the shape. From the incision that is on the side of the temple, to the second incision: and scrape off all the skin that is between the two incisions with a scalpel, which is above the mouth. Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision. Then remove that narrow spoon and insert another instrument into the first incision, which is called a sharp blade, gently from one side and not sharply from the other side. And this is its shape.
And place its sharp edge towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its gentle edge towards the mouth; and push it until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except for what continues in the incision until it appears on the skin.
Then do the same in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after an equal amount of blood has been allowed to run out, squeeze out the places from the clots of congealed blood.
Then place a bandage made from old linen cloth on every fissure, and put on them small woolen pads soaked in wine or oil, or vinegar.  /> And be sure that no hot abscess forms.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage and administer a large amount of decoction with warm water.  /> Then treat it with balm ointment and other remedies for wounds until it heals.
Chapter 5
¶ On the treatment of sharp tears and colds to the eyes from inside the head.
When someone has sharp, acrid, persistent colds; and you see their eyes are wasted, small, and the look in them is already weakened; and their eyelids have ulcers, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, painful pain at the back of the head, followed by sneezing: then take from these events that those humors and colds do not come except from many veins.  />
And a better treatment for them is this. It is as though you were to instruct the patient to shave his forehead. Then make an incision in the middle of the forehead or slightly to one side across its width, and begin with the incision from the left temple towards the right: and let the incision go as far as the mouth: and keep your hand away from the temples which move during chewing; until the mouth is revealed: and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with an old rag or with linens from flax. Then bind it on top with bandages; and moisten the bandages with wine and oil, so that no hot abscess may form.
And when you remove it, and see that the hot abscess is already diminishing; then it is necessary for you to scrape the mouth until new flesh begins to grow there.
Then care for him with the drying regimen that makes flesh grow, as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the newly growing flesh in these wounds.
Chapter VI.
¶ On caring for what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a liquid, such as water and vinegar and things similar to them; or some sort of animal.  /> 12/5
Therefore, when a stone or something like a stone that does not grow or increase falls into the ear, expose the ear to sunlight; and if you see the stone, then drip some of the oil of violets or sesame oil into the ear. Then administer the extraction and make him sneeze with snuff, and plug the nostrils at the onset of sneezing, after you have placed shreds from cloth or wool around the ear, and stretch the ear upwards.
For often it escapes with this treatment.
If it does not escape, then administer the extraction with gentle purgatives, that is, with subtle suppositories, whose form is this.
Therefore if it escapes with the suppository, that is good.
And if not, then administer the extraction with a subtle blind hook of few folds.
Therefore if it does not escape through that [method], then make a tube from copper and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole very deeply; and plug what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no path for air except through the tube: then extract with your strong attraction.
For often it escapes with what we have described. If it does not escape this way, then take from henbane or from glue, that is, prepared birdlime, a small amount; and place it on the end of a rod after you have wrapped around it a clean cloth neatly arranged: then insert it into the ear hole with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Therefore if it does not escape with all that we have described, then hasten to cut [it], before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the manner of the incision is, as for a bloodletting, first make an incision on the temporal artery; and draw out blood from him according to his strength.  /> Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and find a small incision at the root of the ear in its fatty part in a depressed place itself; and let the incision be lunar-shaped until you reach the stone; then remove it with what is possible for you from instruments.  />  />
Then attend to the split from your time with speed, and care for it until it heals.
But if the falling object is one of those seeds which grow and swell, then extract it.
However, if it does not obey you to come out, then take a thin, subtle probe according to this shape.
And perform with it the cutting of that type of seed which falls into the ear and does not do this when you think that the seed is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you divide it into many pieces; then remove them with tweezers or with a fine hook or with suction, as we have said, for its removal is made easier. 》
In the case of water which enters the ear, the sick person should use sneezing first of all; and now he has filled his ear with some old cooked grain: and it is lying on that ear which contains the water. Therefore if it comes out through it, it is good.
And if it does not come out, then take many small stones according to the length of the finger, thin and soft, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the sick person put one into his ear canal; and let him stand on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear. 》 》 》 Therefore he should not cease doing this with stone after stone until all the water comes out.
And now the water comes out so that you take one reed or rush and put one end into the ear; and light the other end with fire until most of it is burned up. Then repeat this with another reed, and do this many times until all the water comes out; and remove it with a tube as we have said above regarding the stone. 》 》 》 》 》 》
In the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is a small body, like a flea and similar to it, care for it as I said in division.
But if it is of a large body, which can be perceived by the senses: then administer its extraction with tweezers and hooks, and its process is easier than all that are held in the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm born in the ear, when you care for it with what we said in division and in the discussion on drops, your treatment is not beneficial; then you must examine the ear in sunlight. Therefore, if something appears there from the worms, then extract it with tweezers or with fine hooks.
But if nothing appears there, then take a tube whose form is this: narrow at the bottom, wide at the top; and insert its fine tip into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; then suck with strong suction. Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
But if they do not obey you to come out, then fill around the tube with wax, as I said about the pebble.
But if they do not come out with that which we said, then administer the drops that have been found effective by the ancients for the destruction of worms; and you will find this in the discussion on drops.
And let your pouring be such that you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. As you see, make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom, in which there should be a small hole, wide at the top.
Therefore, let what is in the cavity of the tube be made neatly from brass. And if you wish, take a stick, and wrap a fine thread around its tip with decent wrapping; then pour oil or juice, or whatever you want from these medicines into the tube; and let the tube be in the ear; then insert the stick with the thread on top, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure until the oil is pushed into the cavity of the ear, and the patient feels it inside; and what is poured into the ear should already be warmed a little with fire; and beware that what is distilled into it is not very cold; for medicines do not tolerate this.  />
Chapter Seven
"On the Care for an Ear Injury
Sometimes infants come out of their mothers' wombs unruptured.
And it has also happened to some people that an ear injury occurs in the inner part of the ear due to a wound or fleshy growth there.
And this injury sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which does not affect vision; and sometimes it happens near the outer part of the ear canal, and then it affects vision.
Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear and which sight does not perceive is difficult to heal in most situations.
And in the case where vision is affected, it is necessary to place the ear of the patient in the sunlight and look into it; then if you see an apparent injury, open it with a fine probe whose shape follows this one [drawing], its tip should have a small flat area at the end, part of which should be sharp: and the rest of the probe should be smooth on both sides so that it does not harm the ear. 》
Therefore, if the injury is due to flesh growing in the inner part of the ear, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it away with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
If the injury is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth wire and heat it briefly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
If you feel the injury with it, which the patient perceives with difficulty in hearing, try to open it gently: and be careful not to wound the nerves of the ear. 》
Then place in the ear a piece of cloth according to the width of the ear canal, which you have rolled in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure about the healing of the wound.
Or take a piece of cloth and dip it in rose water, and sprinkle ground cinnamon on it, and use it.
If you see the ear already infected with pus, then you must extract the hair, and place it together with another hair that you will wrap in a rag made with rose oil, until the hot infection subsides; then treat it until it heals.
But if there is a flow of blood, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place the ear upon it; and use the remaining treatment that cuts off the flow of blood as described in the treatise on distillations.
On the care for sty in the eyelids.
Chapter 8
These styles that occur in the eyelids of the eye are sometimes wet and sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary to hold them with tweezers or with a hook, and cut them off from their roots with a knife. Then place powdered alum on the places.
But if there is a flow of blood from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens-shaped cautery. ●
And it is better to cauterize them after the incision. For often they return when something remains from their roots. ● ● And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned up and do not return. ● ●
¶ On the care for chalazions in the eyelids of the eye. ● ● ●
Chapter 9 ● ● ●
It often happens in the eyelids that something similar to a chalazion appears in its strength and hardness, and on account of this it is called a hailstone; and it is an accumulation of thick humidity in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
The operation on them is that you should then see if it is a hailstone extending from the eyelid, which moves in every direction and its substance is soft. ● ● ● ●
"Therefore, find over it a crack of equal width. "Then excoriate it from all sides with ease until it comes out. "Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
"However, if you cannot cut it off unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a slight incision, then that could harm the patient in some way.
"But if the crack is large: then stitch it up and care for it until it heals.
"And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it. "For an ointment restores and heals it.
"And if the gravel is sloping toward the inner surface of the ear, then turn back the eyelid and suspend the gravel with a hook; besides needing an incision, press it from all sides.
"If the eyelid is stretched by the incision, that will not harm in any way.
"Then wash the eye with salt water after removing the gravel, and care for the area with what heals until the patient is well.
"§ On the treatment of trachoma of the eyelids.
Chapter 10
"Trachoma is the grease that forms in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and it most often occurs in children. It weighs down their eyes, and they frequently have morning colds, unable to look at the sun because tears rush to them, which is why you see them always lying on their faces and sleeping on them, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are wet from inflammation. The protruding Axirnath is visible in the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the way of performing it is that the patient places their head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare in it a bandage, and make from that bandage a circle according to the size that contains Axirnath from every side. Then place it over [the wound], and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that Axirnath collects in the middle of the circle.
Then find in the middle of that moisture with a thin blade making incisions across [the circle], and let the incision not be deeper than that which is made in venesection.
Or you should find the entire skin, until you reach Axirnath, for in many arrangements proceeds Axirnath from the incision according to the shape of a white fatty piece.
Therefore, take it out with the cloth that you have placed between your fingers on the outside; and you turn your hand to the right and to the left, until it is dispersed; and beware not to add [anything] in the incision, so that you do not reach with the blade to the eye and injure it. ➤
However, if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, then add a little [more] easily into the incision until Axirnath proceeds. Then take it out as we have said.
Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on [the wound], and bind it with bandages.
And there are people who grind salt and place it in the depth of the incision, so that it may liquefy what remains from that moisture.
Then care for [the wound], until it heals.
However, if a hot abscess occurs there, then care for it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ On the types of ataxia of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye is softened, whereby it causes a disturbance as if it should not.
Chapter XI
When hairs grow in the eyelids besides their natural course and become long, they harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as constant tearing, swelling of the eyelids, and opacities, until it leads to the destruction of the eye.
And ataxia of the eye is treated in four ways. Either by cautery with fire. Or with a caustic medicine, as previously stated in the chapter on cautery. Or ataxia is treated by incision and suture.  />Aut per punctum. Or with cannulas, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap. Then, turn back the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If it turns back, that is good. And if it does not: insert a needle with thread into the lower part of the eyelid and pass the needle with the thread through the upper part, placing it near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow. Pull the thread to the top along with the eyelid and turn it back with a rod.
Then, find the space inside the eyelid beneath the added hairs using a blunt instrument from the greater lacrimal gland to the lesser one.
Then, pull out the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid; then mark on the eyelid with an enkauster in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the figure should be made according to the size and thickness of the eyelid, as it varies among individuals.
For there are those who need to have cut from the eyelid a large quantity, according to the amount that swells up in the eyelid.
Then when you find the space between the two lines that you marked, begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller one, and let there be a single slit near the natural hairs, like the thickness of a hair.
Then introduce a hook into one of the two corners of the skin. Then scrape it off entirely. Then join the two lips with a stitch using a fine woolen thread and needle; clean away the blood and let what remains of the threads adhere to the two eyebrows with some unguents, if you wish to do so; otherwise, it does not matter.
Then leave the stitch and threads for three or four days; after that, take care of it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without a stitch and care for it with something that dries and constricts it. For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and its joining; but it will be better in the future.
This method of treatment was taught by the ancients to Ataxmir.
However, there is concern for the patient with this method, and it is from good practice, and there is no fear about it.
And there is another method in Ataxmir as well, and it is to mark on the eyelid a figure like that of a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate or joined hooks according to this following figure; then cut away what is excessive with small scissors according to this figure, with an equal incision.
But if you cannot hold the hook and it is not equal, then take a needle with thread on it and insert it in the middle of the figure; and introduce another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second one near the smaller tear duct; and join the threads between your fingers with equality. 》
Then raise your hand with an equal elevation: and raise the skin over which the scar is marked, as we have said.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches: and care for it until it heals.
But if an abscess occurs at your incision or fracture: cauterize that abscess with a hot iron and similar things from the soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs turn inward.
Therefore, you should use what we said about the incision: but the stitching of both is more artistic. § On treating Ataxia with Cannabis.
And it is as if you turn the eyelid and cut the crack that is inside, as I have said. Then skillfully make two reeds or two thin pieces of wood whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of the spatula; and you have already cut at the ends of both from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then bring both together with skill over that which protrudes from the eyelid of the eye, and tie the two reeds strongly on both sides, and leave it for several days. For the skin, having been tightly bound, will die, blacken, and rot until it falls off by itself.
If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.  /> Then care for it until it heals.
When it has solidified, raise the eyelid; and the hairs will not irritate.
And this is the form of the two reeds which you make according to this figure and quantity in length and width.  />  />
Chapter XII
§ On raising irritating hairs in the eye with a needle.
Operation in that is, that you should take a fine needle and introduce into it a fine thread of silk gently. Then you will bind the ends together with two very fine knots; and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then prepare another fine thread under it briefly, and if you wish, bind its ends together.
Then let the patient place his head on your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the operation can be seen; because this is a fine or minute operation.
Then introduce the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you pull it out above the natural hair.
Then draw up the hair over the thread; and insert that hair into the thread, if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then draw your hand with it until the hair comes out with the thread from the eyelid together with the natural hair.
But if the thread is drawn and the hair does not come out with it, draw the thread downward with the other thread that you prepared in it until the thread comes out from the upper hole, and you see it with the eye; then draw the thread and the hair together, and pull both out, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair sticks to its place, and flesh grows over it.
But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs and pull it up with it; or leave it until it lengthens after some time, and then pull it up yourself.
Chapter XIII
When this entropion occurs in the eye, it is called leporine.
And this is either congenital or acquired.
Therefore, it occurs accidentally from the healing of a wound, or an incision, or cauterization, and similar things.
And the method of operation is that you should locate that healing and separate its lips, and place between them a bandage of linen, and bind it until it heals.
And you should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict, for if you do this, the condition returns worse than before. Rather, use in it things that soften, such as fenugreek; and an infusion of water in which mallow has been boiled, flax seed, and diacolon ointment mixed with some oil. And wrap a bandage with it, and treat it with this.
The treasure of your treatment is to strive by every means that it does not heal according to its first shape.
And this operation that we have mentioned is nothing other than a correction of the axlatrati, so that the shape of the place does not completely return.
¶ Concerning the treatment of axlatrati that occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkle or contraction upward toward the right and left.
Chapter XIV
This axlatrati that occurs below is what is truly called axlatrati. And it is either congenital or acquired.
And the acquired type occurs from a wound, or a fissure, or cauterization, and similar things.
And the method of operation is to take a needle with two threads attached, and dip it in ink, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal gland to the right lacrimal gland until the thread comes out at both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upward with a needle, and cut it with a broad spatula. If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.
And if not, take a reed and place it in the slit, and turn the eyelid with it. And find two slits on the inner side of the eyelid, and let their ends be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle; so that when they come together, it forms this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp lower edge reaches the part that follows the eyelid. Then join the separated parts; or sew it with a wool thread.
Then treat them with what we have said about softening medicines and ointments, until they heal.
And if entropion occurs from the slit, or sewing, or cautery, then you must make a flat incision under the eyelashes of the eyelid, even as it has been described before. Then separate between the two lips with ointment, as we have said.  />
And the end of the discourse on the treatment of entropion, whether it is above or below, is that this operation be carried out according to the preparation of the form of entropion.
For indeed, it has many different forms; and the skillful practitioner prepares his ingenuity with whatever method is possible for him, so that he may bring back the shape to its natural form or very close to it, and even the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in most dispositions.
Chapter XV.
¶ On the adherence of the eyelid of the eye with the conjunctiva or cornea.  />
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid fuses with the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
You should therefore insert the point of a needle under the eyelid and lift it up, or stretch it with a hook. Then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be as sharp as the incising spatulas, but rather blunt for a short time, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed without injuring the eye with its sharpness. And your incision should be as if you are scraping off that adhesion with ease, until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the adhesion heals completely.
Then pour salt water into the eye and wash it with that water, or distill it into the eye using a sieve made from zinc dissolved in water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen cloth, and place a woolen cloth soaked in egg white over the eye. After three days, use the sieve and bandages until it heals.
§ On the incision of the nail and the excess flesh of the tear ducts.
Chapter 16
Know that the nail exists in two forms. Either it is nerve-like and resembles a fine, hard sieve, or It is not nerve-like but resembles a frozen, white moisture. When you touch it with an iron tool or try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks off and the hook does not penetrate into it.
And both types do not appear except from the larger tear duct, which gradually grows until it covers the sight and prevents light and movement of the eye. 》
And the method for operating on it is that the patient should place his head in your lap. Then open his eyes and raise the eyelid with your hand. Then collect the fingernail with a small hook, and extend it towards the top. Then take a needle and insert a horsehair, or cow hair, or goat hair into it; and let the thread be strong, and slightly double the end of the needle, and fix it in the middle of the nail; and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it towards the top; and strip off the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were pulling it out with the hair until its very end.
Then cut the remainder in the root of the tear duct with a fine scalpel or with small scissors; and leave the natural tear flesh intact, so that persistent tearing does not occur from the incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone; or with a thread, as we have said. Then it should be scraped gently with a scalpel of this form.
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the transparent membrane and cause a break in it, and the pupil be pierced.
Then after the incision, put some crushed salt, or made from sieved sandalwood, into the eye, and leave it until another day. Then care for him with what is needed until he heals.
If the nail is not fleshy and you cannot insert a needle into it nor can a hook be fixed in it, then this type of nail is often cured with medicines, and heals as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye and take a fine, gentle, weakly sharp scalpel of this form. And scrape the nail from above with subtlety. If you see that it becomes thin and brittle, and a wrinkle imprints on it, then distill into the eye from your hour with sieve made from ziniar, or with red sieve, or with ground salt: and fill the eye until another day.
Then repeat this same procedure until it is all removed. Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye: then leave it alone and care for the abscess until it heals.
Then repeat the procedure with wrinkle until it heals.
If the prominent flesh of the tear duct is causing great harm to the eye, it should be hung with a hook and cut from that part: and do not complete the incision so that the course of tears will not occur.
Then distill into the tear duct with a red sieve or one made from ziniar until it heals.
¶ On the incision of Alguardenic and flesh formed in the eye.
Chapter Seventeen
Sometimes in certain people's eyes, red flesh forms and covers or almost covers the pupil, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards; and it resembles a rosebush.
And the treatment for this is that the patient should put his head in your lap. Then open the eyes of the patient and collect all that flesh with appropriate hooks; and hold it with one forceps or tweezers. ‍
Then cut the flesh first until all of it is completed with a scalpel. And be careful not to harm the eye during the procedure; and your incision should be with what you cut it with, or with a small spatula, as we have said in the incision of the fingernail: or with small forceps, with which asebel is collected, according to its form after this chapter.
And so when your incision is complete and all the white of the eye has been removed, then fill the eye with ground salt or sprinkle red powder and similar things from corrosive medicines onto it; and place a piece of eggshell with its membrane outside the eye to protect it from a hot sty.
If some of the white of the eye remains and hot blood prevails in you and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye alone and treat it with that which calms the abscess.
Then repeat the procedure on it until it heals.
And do likewise with the flesh that happens to be in the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary that those who are treating any weak eye from natural or accidental causes with the knife should not intervene in any of these operations until you see that this member is able to bear that operation.
¶ About collecting pus from the eye.
Chapter Eighteen
Pus is red veins that are spread over the eye and prevent vision from functioning properly; they weaken the eye with the passage of time.
Therefore, first of all, you must consider whether the eye in which there is pus is strong and has no other disease apart from pus; then collect the pus from it.
And tell the patient to place his head on your lap.
Then suspend those veins with one or two hooks according to your skill; and the hook should be thin, made of silver, like this, or there may be two hooks joined together on one body, like this.
Then collect those veins with fine scissors carefully and wipe away the blood hour by hour until you see those veins removed from the eye and they are released; and beware of injuring the eye with the tips of the tweezers.
And let your operation be in the midday before the sun, and be steadfast in your operation very much: so that you do not cut except those veins.
And when you have irrigated, then apply drops to the eye, either green or red, so that with its sharpness it may gnaw away what remains of the stye.
But if you are not able to remove all of it in that time, then apply a plaster to the eye with what will soothe the pain of the eye; and leave it for several days, until its pain is quieted: and be sure that it has been freed from the hot stye. Then repeat on it according to the same method, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scissors.
About bringing back a deviated septum to the nose.
Chapter Nineteen
Doctors call a deviated septum a fistula, which you should treat with a cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as its previous account stated.
And if it does not heal, then there is no cure for it, except to incise over the stye at its base and draw out all of the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the opening is exposed.
Therefore, when the opening has been exposed and you see corruption or blackness within it, then shave it with an instrument whose form is this:
And its name is "cap of roughness.
Let it be made of Indian steel, and let its head be round like a needle, which has been marked by the marking of a file or the fine marking of a burnisher; and place it on the corrupted place of bone.
Then turn it between your fingers and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption has been shaved away; and do this several times.
Then restore the place with drying, styptic medicines.
If the place is consolidated and flesh grows there, and the course of pus is cut off: and it remains for forty days, and does not renew, and does not suppurate, and no accident occurs in it: then you should know that it has already healed.
And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nasal aperture according to this form.
And it is that you expose the bone with an iron instrument or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take a trepan according to this form, let its tip be triangular of iron: and its handle be a tapered pyramid up to the tip, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself; and let it be near the tear duct; and keep your hand away from the eye a little. Then turn your hand with the trepan, until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it; through this that he finds air coming out of it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
When flesh grows and the place hardens: then the matter that was discharged to the outside returns to the nose; therefore it is easier on the patient.
¶ On the Reduction of a Swelling of the Eye
Chapter 20
When the eye swells completely and there is no harm or diminution of sight: then it is necessary that you release the patient; then bleed him; afterwards place cupping glasses on his neck without scarifying, but with suction.
Then apply to the eye an ointment made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla. Then bind the eye above with many thin bandages over the plaster.
And the method of poultices is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth from them should be folded into four; make many of them. Then place them one on top of another according to the amount the eye needs. Then bind them strongly with a hard cloth.
And use fumigations with suction without scarifying.
Then remove the fumigation and leave the eye bound day and night.
But if the swelling again becomes soft, then it must be bound tightly; then remove the binding after one day and night, as we have said.
Therefore, if you see the eye has returned to its normal state, it is good; and if not, then repeat the application of the poultice, and the binding, and the fumigations, until it heals.
§ On the incision of the eye's tunica.
Chapter 21.
When a break occurs in the eye's tunica, then it protrudes and extends outside the eyelids like a grain of the eye, and it disfigures the person's appearance because of this, and he wishes to cut it off. Then the operation is as I describe: that you insert a needle into the root of the eye from the lower part to the upper part. ‌
Then insert another needle with double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle in its place.
Then cut the place of the double thread and tie with it the part of the eye around the needle; and bind it tightly.
Then remove the needle, and place a wool cloth soaked in egg white on the eye; and leave it until the thread falls with the eye.
Then care for the eye with what strengthens it until the wound heals.
And sometimes the eye is bound from all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds a large protrusion.
Then it should be pierced with a fine probe until it reaches the depth of the eye, and let the moisture of the sclera flow out, and let the eye fall out, and immediately enter; then bind it until it heals.
About the treatment of alcomnatis (a kind of eye disease or disorder).
Chapter 22.
This sickness called alcomnatis is nothing but a purulent discharge that accumulates in the eye, similar to water descending from above, and it is not [the eye itself].
And the method for treating this condition is that you should make the sick person sit on a prepared or upright seat.
Then take his head with your hands from both sides and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts of the eyes. Then let it be fixed in place and not move downward, and the light will become clear; and the sick person will see things as he used to see them. And if it does not go downward, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the pus does not occur as we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a fine probe and pierce with it slightly above the thin skin where the conjunctiva meets the corneal layer in the corner of the eye, until the pus comes out. ️
When the pus comes out, then drip warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
About the treatment of water that has descended into the eye or cataract. ️
Chapter 23.
We have already mentioned the types of water in the division and what applies to piercing according to the explanatory discourse and exposition; then take that same [thing] according to healthiness.
Then you should make the sick person sit between your hands, facing the light, near the sun. And bind his healthy eye and tighten it strongly. Then with your right hand, hold closed the eyelid of his left eye (in which is the water), or with your left hand, if the eye in which is the water is the right one.
Then take with your right hand almagdah if the eye is left: or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Then place the end of the almagdah near the crown in the thickness of the radius where the white of the eye appears, next to the smaller tear duct; then push the almagdah with force, and turn your hand with it until it penetrates the sclera of the eye, and you will feel that the almagdah has reached a hollow place.
And the measure of the journey of the almagdah should be deep, as much as the space is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the crown of the eye. For you will see these things in the pupil of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the almagdah up to the point where there is water. Then press it down with one force after another.
If therefore water descends immediately, then the patient sees that thing on which he opens his vision immediately, and the almagdah in his eye.
Then wait a little while. If water descends again, then remove it a second time, except that the almagdah comes out. xspace
When it is fixed and does not rise again, then remove the almagdah gently; and turn your hand slowly.
Then dissolve some clear salt from the mine in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then place outside the eye a piece of wool or cotton soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind it with the healthy eye.
We, however, and those who are of our time, place on it ground cumin seed mixed with egg white.
If the almagdah does not obey you for entry into the eye because of its hardness, since it is made from people whose eyes are very hard, then you should take a spatula called Alberid, which looks like this.
Therefore bind it with that very suture, and do not thrust your hand into the opening; there is no need to make a path to the almagda place, but rather make the way subtly.
Then insert the almagda, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient a well-made bed in which he may sleep on his back in a darkened house; and let him be kept from all movements and coughing; and give him such food as is gentle to his nature; and let him not turn his head either to the right or left at all.
And let the bandage remain in place according to its position until the third day.
Then remove it in that darkened house, and test his sight; and make him look at things. Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not proper to do this at the time of dressing or immediately after the incision; rather one should delay it; because water rises quickly through a strong gaze.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then one should remove the bandage before the seventh day; and correct it with that which allays the abscess until it is allayed; then release his sight, and place on his face an oculus to regulate his vision under it for several days, while he remains in the darkened house.  />
Then let him go out of the house gradually, and turn about in his affairs.
And know that a student is not excused from looking at it several times; then he may dare to perform the operation.
And indeed there has come to us a certain man from those who are of Aleppo, who said that in Aleppo a magda was pierced through which water is sucked up.
Truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read of it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of medicines from honey, so that one who does not know them may stand over them.
They should be made properly from air, and their ends should be triangular with the same subtlety and sharp.
Chapter Fourteen.
¶ On the care for flesh grown in the nose.
Sometimes fleshy growths of various kinds appear in the nose, among which is something resembling a many-legged scorpion; and from this comes cancerous flesh, stony flesh, dark in color; and from this comes flesh that is soft and not dark in color.
In that which is from these fleshes and is soft, not fraudulent or cancerous, you should make the sick person sit between your hands facing away from you; then open his nose and insert a hook into those fleshy growths; afterwards draw them out to the outside and cut off what you have grasped from them with a thin, sharp spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been completely removed.
But if any of it remains which cannot be cut off, then scrape that away with a single delicate instrument easily until nothing of it remains. But if there is too much blood or a hot swelling occurs, then apply what is necessary to it; or if it is from malignant swellings, hasten to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the fleshy growths are removed.
Then after cutting pour vinegar, water, or wine into the nose. But if the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that he is now cured.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within there is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nose, which the instrument did not reach when cutting.
Then you must introduce a linen thread with some thickness and tie many knots in it; put a finger's width or less between each knot. The patient should insert the end of the thread into the nose with a bone splinter or whatever he can, after making it similar to azar. He should pull on his nasal septum until it reaches the cavity and comes out over his throat.
And indeed, many times schoolchildren do something similar to this Atom boy; it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread; one end that comes out over the nose and the other that remains inside the nose. Then, with the aid of a saw, cut the flesh along with the knots on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is already with the knots on the thread.
Then remove the thread and insert into the nose, after washing off the blood, a linen cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for three days or more until all the remaining ointment from the flesh is completely dissolved.
Then at the end of the treatment, insert a lead tube into the nose for several days until it heals.
If however, dry treatment is needed, use that one.
To make a headpiece for distilling oil and other medications into the nose, make it from silver or copper; let it be similar to a small lamp, open like a snail shell, and its channel likewise.
And if you wish, make it as a closed tube, like a reed.
And the snail-shaped instrument for making a headpiece should be full and open; it should have a handle at its end, with which you hold it when heating oil or anything else you wish from juices and flexible substances in it.
Chapter 25.
Often a polyp appears at the tip of the nose and grows larger with time until it becomes unsightly.
And because of this, it is necessary that you cut it out at the beginning of its appearance and remove all of it. Then place on the site either a hot iron or a burning medication which will take its place.
If its cutting is delayed until it grows large, then consider whether it is stony, hard, dark in color, and relatively insensitive: then do not touch it with iron because it is a malignant tumor.
For often I have seen someone cut into this type of polyp, and a great evil befell the one who had it.
And if the polyp is soft to touch, not dark in color, and you see that it is possible to cut into all of it, then evacuate the patient and cut it without fear or hesitation: and treat the site with something that dries and constricts until it heals.
Chapter 26.
¶ On suturing the nose, lip, and ear.
Know that when there is a disruption of continuity in one of these cartilages, surgery is of little benefit except in certain people.
Therefore, when something like this happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood: then join the lips of the wound with suture: then treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of the disruption have already separated and each part has healed: then it is necessary that you scrape off all the part from its apparent skin until it bleeds. Then join the two lips with suture and tighten them, and sprinkle on it powdered dragon's blood and ground frankincense: and place over the powders a piece of adhesive plaster and another consolidating one: and leave it tied for two days or three. Then dissolve it, and exchange the medicine; and let it go until the threads are cut by themselves. Then care for him with an ointment, until he is healed.
The method of suturing is to join the solution of continuity either with needles, as we have described in the suturing of the belly; or join the solution with a thread, as I have taught you.
Chapter 27.
¶ On the extraction of lip nodes.
Many people have hard nodes on their lips like grains of barley; some are smaller and others larger.
Therefore, you should turn back the lip and pierce through every node of it, and hang it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Then fill the place after cutting with crushed rush-root, until the blood is stopped.
Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place should be scraped with it, until the wounds are healed. 》
Chapter 28.
¶ On the incision of flesh on the gum.
Often there appears over the gums a growth of extra flesh which the ancients call "abulus.
Therefore you should hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, allowing the pus or blood to flow out.
Then place crushed rush-root or other hemostatic powders over the site.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does return, then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return after cautery.
Chapter 29. 》 》 》
¶ On filing teeth with iron.
Sometimes on the surfaces of teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums, rough scabs form, which are ugly; sometimes they turn black, yellow, or green, until that corruption reaches the gum, making the teeth foul-smelling through it.
It is therefore necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands, and rest their head on your chest. Grind away the enamel and the tooth in which there appear to you cortices and a substance similar to sand: until nothing remains of them. And do likewise with blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other stains until they are cleansed.
Therefore, if the cause of what is in them is removed at the beginning of treatment, that is good; and if not, then repeat the treatment on them on another day, a second time, and a third time, until finally your effort achieves what you desire.
And know that the tooth requires rasps of various shapes and many forms according to how it is prepared for your operation; because the rasp by which the tooth is scraped from below is different from the rasp by which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other shapes.
And let these shapes of rasps be prepared with you, as you see.
Chapter 30
§ On the Extraction of Toothache
It is necessary to cure the tooth from its pain with all skill and delay in extracting it. For it is not right to remove it when it is extracted, since it is a sublime substance; unless there is no choice but to extract it, then the patient must be forced to extract it so that the painful tooth may be strengthened and confirmed with you.
For often the pain deceives the patient and they think it is in the tooth, and so they extract it; then the pain does not go away until the tooth itself is extracted.
For we have already seen this from the practice of bloodletting physicians.  />
When the painful tooth itself is confirmed with you, then it is necessary to scarify around the tooth with a spatula that has some virtue, until the gum is dissolved from all sides; then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until you shake it out.  />  •
Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and hold the patient's head between your knees, which you have already secured well so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under the tooth from all sides easily, and try to move it as you did at first.
If the tooth is perforated or decayed, then you should fill that hole with a cloth and tie it tightly with a thin wire so that it does not break when you constrict it with forceps on top of it.
And you should carefully perform the scraping around the entire gum very well.
And be careful not to break it and leave a piece behind, which would cause the patient more pain than before.
And beware of doing what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and recklessness in removing it, besides giving that which we have mentioned.
For they often cause great illnesses to happen to people, whose consequences are more difficult to heal, and all or some of the roots remain, or they extract it with some bones of the jaw, as we have witnessed many times.  />
Then rinse with wine, vinegar, and salt after its removal.
If bleeding occurs from the site (for it often happens), then grind some myrobalan and fill the site with it; if not, cauterize the site if myrobalan does not help you.
The form of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long arms, a short handle, and be thick so that they do not bend when pressed on the tooth; let them be like you see with thick handles, until when you tighten them, they do not give way or bend: with short arms, and let them be made decently from Indian iron, or well-made steel, with straight arms; and in their extremities there should be teeth, some of which fit into others and hold with a decent and strong constriction.  />  />
And sometimes the ends are like the beak of a bird called stork, and they are very tight.
Chapter 31.
On extracting teeth, and removing broken jawbones.
When something remains in the extraction of a tooth that is broken, then you should place a cloth soaked with butter over the place for one day or two days until the area softens. Then insert into it algasti or forceps, whose ends resemble the beak of a bird called stork. And this is the shape of the forceps.
Their ends should be made like a file inside, or like a small scissor.
Therefore, if it does not obey you in exiting with these forceps, then you should hollow out the root and expose all the flesh, and insert a small crowbar, which looks like this.
Let it be short at the end, somewhat thick; and let it not be wet, so that it does not break.
Therefore, if the root exits through it, it is good; and if not, you must help with these other instruments whose shapes are these.
The shape of the first is a triangular end, in which there is some thickness.
The shape is of a thin triangular end. 》
And with other instruments and tools which have been mentioned in the section on teeth.
It is also helped by this instrument which resembles a large hook of this shape, with a twisted triangular end, in which there is some thickness so that it does not break; and let it not be wet. 》 》
And know that there are many instruments of the teeth; and similarly the rest of the instruments are not counted, and a skilled craftsman, who is clever in his art, finds for himself an instrument according to what the operation and the diseases themselves indicate.
Because there are diseases for which the ancients did not mention an instrument, due to their diverse types.
If, however, a bone is broken from the jaw or other bones of the mouth, or if it becomes putrid, then investigate above it in its place with what suits it from the instruments and tongs that I mentioned for extracting roots, and help with this, whose shape is this.
Let there be something thick in it little by little, so that it may be tied or held with the bone and not flee and go away, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with suitable medicines for it.
But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it off from its putrefaction and care for it until it heals.
Chapter XXXII.
Concerning the Sawing of Prominent Teeth over Others.
When teeth prominently project not according to their natural course, an ugly appearance is made by that: and especially when it happens to women and girls, namely sellers of themselves.
Therefore, you must consider. For if a tooth is born after another tooth and is not located properly, or its sawing or planing is possible, then extract it: and if it is connected to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose shape is this.
It is similar to a small beak and is made of Indian iron, very sharp at its tip.
And let your cut with which you cut it be over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not moved.
But if it is exposed to its planing: then plane it with a plane from India, whose shape is this.
Let the whole [plane] be from India, and its handle very small, like a plane with which needles are made: with which the tooth is planed little by little over many days easily, so that the tooth is not moved and falls; then anoint it in the end, scrape it with certain scrapers.  ?> Et quod scias hoc est instrumentum quod dicitur bisturi.
If it is a tooth that is broken and injures the tongue, then it is necessary to smooth it also, until the roughness of that break is removed and made even: and it flattens out and does not injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.
Chapter 33.
¶ On the Extraction of Teeth with Gold Threads.
When it happens that the anterior teeth are concussed and shaken by a blow or accident and the patient cannot hold together what he eats so that it does not fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines and the cure did not work, then the plan is to tie them with a gold thread because silver turns green and putrefies after a few days, but gold never changes. ¶ When you bind the teeth, make sure to bind from the root of the tooth up to the neck of the tooth, and tie it carefully in the middle so that there is no slack nor is it too tight; take care not to cause any harm to the gum or the neighboring tooth.
And let the thread be of moderate fineness and thickness according to the size that fits between the teeth.
And the form of extraction is this: take a thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then weave with the two ends of the thread between the moved tooth or teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weaving to the other healthy tooth on the opposite side. Then repeat the weaving until you reach the part where you began; and hold your hand with fineness and wisdom so that it is not entirely removed; and let your constriction by which you bind the thread be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not escape. ¶ And when you have completed this binding, you will find that the tooth or teeth are bound up and secured.
Then cut the overhanging ends of the thread with scissors; and join both together and turn them with a needle; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moved tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it remain tied thus. ¶ And you will find that this binding is a strong aid for the tooth or teeth, so that the patient can chew his food well without difficulty.
If it is loosened or cut, tie them with another thread, and they will remain thus throughout the whole time.
And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of a healthy tooth and an unhealthy tooth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that a tooth or two return to their places after the incident, and are retained as we have said, and they remain there; and this is done only by an experienced and skilled craftsman.
And sometimes a piece from the bones of cows is prepared; and it is made into the shape of a tooth and placed in its place, and the tooth is strengthened and tied as we said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
Chapter 34
Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, which a person is born with, or accidental, from an old wound that has already healed.
And the operation is to open the mouth of the patient while holding their head in your lap, and raise their tongue; then cut through that nerve-like ligament along its width until the tongue is released from its restriction.
But if there is something hard and knotted in it, and it comes from an old wound, then insert a hook into it and seek out the width of it until you cut through the ligament and release the knotting.
And be careful not to make a cut too deep into the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and cause bleeding.
Then wash the site of the incision with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Then place a linen cloth under the tongue, which the patient should hold every night, so that it does not heal again. 》
If blood flow occurs, then place ground zea on the spot. If blood overcomes you, then cauterize the spot with a brunette iron; and then treat it with the other treatment until it heals.
Chapter 35.
It sometimes happens that under the tongue a cyst forms, resembling a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it may swell so much that it fills the mouth.
And the treatment of this is to open the sick person's mouth before the sun, and observe the cyst.
If you see it to be dark-colored or black and hard, with the sick person feeling no sensation in it, then do not touch it because it is cancerous.
And if it is inclined towards whiteness and has moisture, then insert a hook into it and cut it with a thin scalpel, and free it from every part. ︎ If blood overwhelms you during your operation, then place ground zea on it until the bleeding stops; then return to your operation until you remove it with its entirety.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and treat it with the other appropriate treatment until it heals.
About the treatment of a cyst in both tonsils.
Chapter 36.
It sometimes happens between the throat and gullet, that is, between the tonsils, which resemble almonds; they occur externally and are called two amygdalae. If you treat them with what we said in the previous chapter and they do not heal, then observe.
If it is a hard cyst, dark-colored, with little sensation, then do not touch it with iron. ︎ ︎ ︎
And if it is red in color and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood; rather leave it alone until it matures. Then either you will pierce it, or it will burst on its own.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is fine: then it is necessary to cut into it.
And the operation on it is such that before the operation you should consider if its hot inflammation has quieted with a complete quieting or diminishes by some lessening: then have the sick person sit before the sun and let his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let the assistant receive between his hands, and press the tongue downwards with an instrument of this shape.
Let it be made of silver or bronze, which is as fine as a knife.
When therefore you press with it the tongue, and the inflammation is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it out as much as you can towards the outside, except that you pull along with it some of the tunic. ()}
Then cut into it with an instrument of this shape which follows. It resembles scissors; but the ends of it should be curved so that the opening of each is opposite to the sharp point of the other; therefore see to it that it is made of Indian steel or another kind which can hold an edge well.
If however this instrument is not available, then cut into it with a spatula of this shape. Let it be sharp on one side, and not sharp on the other.
And after you have cut into one tonsil, cut into the other in accordance with this same shape of incision.
Then after the incision let the sick person gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.
If he has a flow of blood, let him gargle with water in which the bark of pomegranates or myrtle leaves have been boiled, and similar stiptics, until the flow of blood is stopped; then care for him until he heals.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two tonsils. Therefore, cut those equally as I said for the incision of the two tonsils.
And I myself have already treated a woman for an abscess that had arisen in her throat, which was pulling towards darkness and scarcity of senses, nearly closing her throat; and the woman was breathing from a narrow opening, and it had already prevented her from eating and drinking water; and she had almost reached death if she had remained one day or two.  ()
And the abscess had risen so much that it sent out two branches until they came out through the two nostrils.
I therefore hastened quickly and inserted a hook into one of them. Then I pulled it, and a large piece came out from it.
Then I cut it off where I held it from the nostril.
Then I did to him what had come out of the other nostril.  ()
Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue; and then I inserted a hook into that abscess; then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood came out from it; the woman's throat was therefore healed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then she took food.  ()  ()
I did not therefore cease to cut from that abscess many times over a long period of time; and the abscess would follow in the place where I had cut, until it became too extended with her.
I therefore cauterized the abscess in the throat.
He remained from the addition; then I walked away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
§ On the incision of a uvular swelling.
Chapter 37.
When catarrh descends to the throat and swells and is long, it is then called a perpendicular; and if it is thicker and rounder below, it is then called a grape.
When it is treated with what we have said about division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot swelling has subsided from it and is thin, then you should cut into it.
And if what is gathered from it is round and does not have length, and is red or dark in color, and has no sensation, then you should avoid cutting into it.  For there is danger for the patient in this.
Therefore, when you see it according to the whiteness and its length as I have said, you should make the patient sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument whose previous description has gone before; then insert a hook into the grape and pull it downward; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.      
And you should not cut from it, except that which is added above the natural limit without addition.
For if you cut more from it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use what we have narrated in the incision of the two tonsils; and care for it until it heals.
But if the patient is afraid of the incision, then you should use skill in cauterizing it without fear or dread.
And the method of cautery in it is not, except with boiling water; and it is as if you place the patient's head on your lap.      Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned. Then take from the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and make an unquenched mortar with it, not thick nor too thin, and fill this hollow of the instrument, whose shape is this.
Let its end which holds the medicine be hollowed out like the bowl of a spoon.
And place the instrument with the medicine on the same ulcer: and let the patient lie on his side, so that the saliva runs out of his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends into his throat and harms him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine. And you apply it to the ulcer for half an hour until you see that it has turned black and that the chewing of the medicine has settled down.
And if you wish to use cotton, and wrap it around the end of a spoon, and pour medicine onto the cotton, and insert the spoon with the cotton into the ulcer until the cotton adheres to the ulcer.
Do this many times until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the ulcer. Then leave it alone; for indeed it dries out and falls off after three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization, clean around the ulcer with cotton soaked in butter, and cleanse it with that which is around it from the medicine: and rinse it with cold water.
And let it be scraped externally with plasters, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
This method of treatment is therefore healthier than cutting, and more distant from fear.  />
And sometimes the ulcer is also cured with that which is more subtle than cautery and incision; it is cured with fumigation in this manner. Gather calamentum, hyssop, oregano, rue, saffron, chamomile, and southernwood, along with similar herbs. Combine them all or some of them in a pot and cover with vinegar. Bring to a boil. The pot should be well-lined with clay, and in the middle there should be an opening over which you place a concave instrument in this manner.
It should be made of silver or bronze. Insert the end with the hole into the mouth of the patient until the steam rises through the tube and darkens the throat sufficiently.
Then repeat this process many times until dryness occurs.
Be careful not to perform this treatment at the onset of inflammation. For it often increases the swelling, and you should not do this except when the heat of the inflammation begins to subside.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and place at its end the shell of an egg so that the patient's mouth does not get burned. Because the shell of the egg prevents the steam from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment with health benefits.
¶ On the Extraction of Thorns and Bones from the Throat
Chapter 38
Often, a bone or a fishbone sticks in the throat.
Therefore, you must extract whatever appears, after pressing the tongue with an instrument under bright light and it becomes clear to you what is in the throat.
And if something does not appear and is hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach. For perhaps the thing will come out through the vomit.
Or let the patient swallow a piece of nap, or a lettuce root, or a mouthful of dry bread, or take a piece of soft sea sponge and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it. When it reaches the place of the spine or bone and is extracted, then it exits.
If therefore it does not exit with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead in this shape.
Let it be slightly thicker than a finger and have a curve at its end which he can easily insert into his throat; then let him raise his head upwards.
And let him be careful not to touch his epiglottis, lest he should cough and force out bone or spine; or the physician may insert his hand instead.
It is truly better that the patient insert it himself because of his knowledge of the place where the object is attached; and let him push downwards or pull up his hand with the instrument until everything comes out according to its size.
¶ On the Extraction of Leeches
Chapter XXXIX.
When a leech is treated with the remedy mentioned in the division of treatments with medicines and it does not help, then examine the patient's throat in broad daylight or in sunlight after pressing his tongue with the instrument I have described to you.
If your sight falls upon a leech, extract it with a small hook or with fine tweezers carefully.
If it is not possible with them, then take a hollow cannula and insert it into the patient's throat until it reaches close to the throat; then introduce into the cavity of the cannula a red-hot iron with fire. Do this many times; and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day. ‌
Then let him take a sieve full of cold water and open his mouth into it; and let him rinse his mouth with it, but not swallow any of it; and move the water in one hour after another with his hand. The leech indeed immediately falls when it senses water.
But if it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs or with a bean using the instrument that I have mentioned for the fumigation of the throat.
Do this many times, for she will fall.
And the method of operation in fumigation is to take a pot with live coals and fire, and let the pot be covered with a lid, in whose middle there is a hole; and let the end of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Then pour the fumigation and let the patient put his mouth on the end of the tube, and let him close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech. For the leech will immediately fall.
But if she does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst and eat salted food and garlic, and let him not drink water.
Therefore it is necessary that she will come out with this regime.
And this is the shape of the instrument with which the leech is drawn out from the throat when it falls on its own.
It resembles forceps, as you see, except that this curvature is inserted into the throat. And its end resembles the beak of a bird called a stork, on which there is the roughness of a file; when it grasps something, it does not release it at all. 》
¶ On the opening and cutting of abscesses, and their general care.
Chapter 40
There are many kinds of abscesses and various methods for opening them, according to the memory that comes to us in this book, namely one kind and one in particular; and there are two ways of perforating and cutting them. 》 》 》
One is of the species of a tumor within itself, and because it includes moisture.
And the second method is due to the places where it happens from the body.
Since a tumor occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the anus; and a tumor occurring in a fleshy place is different from one occurring in joints; and each has its own judgment based on its position.
And among tumors there are those which should not be pierced except after the pus in them has matured and completed; and there are some which should be pierced while they are fresh and do not ripen according to their completion.
Like tumors which are near joints.
Since a tumor when it occurs near a joint and its duration is prolonged until what surrounds it putrefies perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are destroyed; therefore it is a closer cause of the contraction of that member.
Or the tumor is in a main limb; since if you delay its piercing until it matures, it will harm either that [limb], or through that main limb [the whole body].
Or it is near the anus; therefore pierce it while it is immature, and you should not pierce a fresh tumor which has not completed its digestion, except that which is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus and become a fistula, or end in a place that does not heal.
You should know the time for piercing a tumor which has matured according to its completion; and it is at the cessation of pain, the subsiding of fever, and the diminution of redness, pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the tumor, and other signs.  />
And you should make the same perforation in the lower part of the tumor and its more prominent area; and let the piercing be along the length of the body if the tumors are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of arms, strings, nerves, arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.  />   
In those [conditions] that reflect, go with a perforation along that membrane.
When the abscess is in fleshy areas, it is better to leave its perforation until its digestion is consolidated, as we have said at the conclusion.
For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there is much dirt and foulness, and perhaps its lips harden and its depth [becomes] affected.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body by necessity, or according to what that member needs.
And you should administer a small perforation for small abscesses and a large perforation for large abscesses, or many sections according to the size of the abscess.
And there are abscesses in which it is necessary to concave the skin and cut when it has become like a cloth, and it has reached its end, that is, it is already dead, as happens with many ulcers and buboes.
And among them are those which are cut with a three-cornered incision. And among them is one which is cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like an inguinal abscess.
And among them are those in which a round section and a crescent-shaped section, and similar ones from the sections, are administered.
However, that which does not have a head, such as are the mild and superficial abscesses, you should perforate it with a superficial or flat perforation only.
And when the abscess is thick and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, do not hasten to extract all the pus at that hour; rather, extract a part of it from it. Then prepare the abscess until another day. Then extract something from the pus again.
Do this many times according to the condition, until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit person; for the vital spirit of the living creature is often released from the body with the discharge of pus, and perhaps the sick person will die, and you won't notice.
Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, by which you pierce these abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound: and observe. If therefore the abscess is small or the incision is flat, then apply a compress of flax or old cotton. And if the abscess is large and the incisions are many, it is then necessary to insert a compress into each incision until they meet each other.
And if in the abscess you have cut off a piece of skin or hollowed it out: then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton, or as when making felt, or shaving flax down without moisture: and bind it tightly until the third day.
Then remove it, and care for it with what is necessary from the ointment, until it heals.
But if bleeding occurs during your procedure, then apply cold water and vinegar, after the cloth has been soaked in them: and place it on the site of the bleeding many times. />
But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer a regimen and treatment and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and from the division.
But if it is during the winter season and the site of the abscess has many nerves, then you should pour hot powders with wine and oil onto it: and place them on the sites.
And if it is in the summer and the places are fleshy; then you must place little poultices soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold. Until the third day, as we have said, then you must release the abscess and clean it, and administer to its healing what is suitable for it, until it heals.
Therefore, this is necessary from the knowledge of treating abscesses universally.
According to half of the distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess and how there is a way to treat it individually by chapter.
Chapter 41.
¶ On the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Little abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the species of nodules, which are enclosed by sheaths, like those of hens' eggs.
And their species are many.
Some of them are fatty; and some contain a moisture like clay; and some contain a moisture similar to gruels or poultices; and others similar to these, and there are those which are hard as stone.
And in the incision of all of them and their extraction there is no danger, as long as during their incision a blood vessel does not cause resistance.
And the operation of their incision is to examine them with an instrument, the shape of which will come after this, called Introducer, until you know what they contain.
For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a section along its length with a superficial section; in this manner. 》
And begin with the section from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated, then remove the skin that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it. 》 》
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.
Often it returns if something of it remains. For it [the kist] indeed eats away what remains from the kist.
Then anoint the cotton a second and third time with the Egyptian [unguent], and if you need to, continue doing so until you are confident that nothing remains of the kist; then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
If the aposteme contains a fatty tumor, then cut it according to this shape, with an incision forming a cross: and throw the hooks between the lips of the incision, and strip it from all sides: and strive to extract the membrane that encloses it.
But if a contrary reaction is caused by the blood vessel, then do what I will tell you later.
And likewise do this for an aposteme if it is stony, with the same incision and treatment as we have said.  />
And the incision on a stony aposteme is easier because it has little blood and moisture. And sometimes there are certain of these apostemes which are on the head in some men, and with which there is no moisture at all.
That is to say, for I cut into an aposteme on the head of an old woman and found the aposteme like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if someone hit it with something thrown at it, it wounded [the person].  />  />
In other apostemes that occur on the head, however, apart from these apostemes that occur on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, let the incision of all of them be a surface incision.
Or make their perforations always from below them, so that the flow of pus will be relieved towards the lower [part].  />  />
Then care for them with what is suitable for their treatment.
Of cutting the tonsils in the neck.
Chapter XLII.
These abscesses often occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins; and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body.
And concerning those which occur in the neck, there is one and many; and they generate each other; and every tonsil among them is within its own proper tunic, just as it is with nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have said.
And there are many types of these tonsils. For some of them are stony; and among them there are those which contain moisture; and among them there are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, when you see one of them which has a good disposition and texture, whose color is close to that of the skin, and it moves in all directions, and it is not connected with the nerves of the neck, or with the vein, or with the artery, and it is not deep; you should cut it out by means of a superficial incision from top to bottom along line b-g, and scrape it off from every side; and spread apart the two lips of the skin with a hook or with many hooks if you need them, as we have said about the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is important to be careful not to cut a vein or nerve.
And let the knife not be very sharp, so that it does not make your hand hesitate with the cutting, or disturb the patient, and you do not cut what is not necessary. ›
But if you cut a vein or artery, and it hinders you from performing the operation, then place in the wound ground zegi, or certain powders which stop bleeding, and bind up the wound, and leave it alone until the inflammation subsides and the wound becomes soft; or begin and it wants to putrefy. › ›
"For blood is severed by the skin, return therefore to your work until you complete it.
Then inquire with your index finger whether there remains anything from the other small strophulae; therefore cut them and clean them out.
But if there is a large vein at the root of the strophula, then you ought not to cut that strophula from its root; rather, you should tie it off with strong doubled thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then care for him.
If the entire strophula is cut off, then you should approximate the two lips of the wound and sew it up immediately after you see that there is no remaining pus.
But if you see that there is remaining pus because of the largeness of the strophula, then you should intend to cut off its root and pull it out; and apply the stitching which we have mentioned.
And for those strophulae which contain humors, make a superficial puncture in them so that you may see their stage of maturity; and make the puncture from below the body as we have said.
Then apply lint with ointment and similar things after the puncture, so that it may eat away what remains of the corruption, until you see the wound has been cleansed; then care for him with regenerative flesh ointment until he is healed.
Chapter 43.
§ On the incision of the epiglottis due to an abscess occurring within the throat.
The ancients said that this incision is made on the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and here is their explanation of it. ›
In those with a stricture, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided because it will not bring benefit; all the veins and lungs are weakened.
In those with a hot abscess in the mouth, throat, or both tonsils, and there is no illness in the intestine, the epiglottis should be incised to avoid the destruction that occurs from choking.
Therefore, when we wish to do this, we should incise the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis with a small incision by width, in that which is between two circles by quantity, so that the incision is in the cartilage, not in the cartilage: and this place is suitable for incision because it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels from it are distant.
If the surgeon is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook. Then let him pierce the skin until it reaches the canal; he should avoid the blood vessel if he sees any of them.
Then let him cut the cartilage as we have said; it is indicated by the suppuration that comes out of the canal along with its breaking and the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time comes that choking is feared, gather together the two lips of the skin wound and suture it alone without the cartilage.
Then apply treatments that cause flesh to grow until it heals.
Albucasis said this. The summary of this discussion that we have narrated is not applicable except when they see that one of these abscesses has already choked the patient's throat and the patient is close to death and wishes to be incised; they go to cut the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe over the wound for a certain breath and be saved from death. And for this reason, they commanded leaving the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice lasts three days or thereabouts; then they commanded suturing the wound and treating it until it heals.
And what I have seen with my own eyes is that a maidservant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, cutting through part of the lung's canal.
And I was called to treat her, and found her moaning like a dying person.
Therefore, I opened the wound and found that blood had come out from it only in small amounts. Therefore, I was confident that she had not cut a vein or an artery; and air was coming out of the wound.
I hastened to sew up the wound and treat it until it was healed; nothing happened to the maidservant except for a hoarseness in her voice, and after some days she returned to better health.
Therefore I say: that there is no fear in cutting the epiglottis.
¶ On cutting a hernia of the throat.
Chapter Forty-Four.
This tumor is called a hernia of the throat; it is a large tumor similar to the color of the body and is common among women.
And there are two types: either it is natural or it is acquired.
Certainly, the natural one has no cleverness.
The acquired type, however, is of two kinds; one resembles fatty nodes.  · And the other type is similar to the tumor that results from a knotting of an artery. And in this case, there is danger; one should not assume to cut it with a knife unless it is small. Test it and examine it with an intromitter. Therefore, if you find it to be like a fatty node and not connected to any veins, then cut it as one would cut a node; and remove it along with the sac containing it, if there is a sac; and if not, then explore its entirety.  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  · Then treat the place with what is needed for healing until it heals.
Chapter 45.
On the cutting of superficial tumors.
There are many kinds of tumors, and I have already described all their types in the division: and it is necessary that I now tell here the difference between a tumor and an abscess, since this causes doubt.
I say therefore that when it is an abscess, there is heat, fever, and severe pain until the ebullition of the superfluity is calmed and the putrefaction is completed; then indeed the fever and heat subside.
But in a tumor, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain; and they contain kistis ifachin, which is their own bag, and it is according to the color of the body: and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like bathecha, either larger or smaller.
And there are two kinds of them: either fatty, or containing moisture. The colors of the moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Therefore, when you come to the healing of a tumor, you must examine it and investigate its contents first with an instrument called a probe, as its form will be shown in the chapter that follows this one.
And the way to investigate all tumors and swellings is as follows: take this instrument and insert it into the moistest part of the tumor which you find; then turn your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin. Then place your hand behind according to the size of the swelling.
Then remove the probe and examine what exits in its wake.
If a running moisture emerges from it, whatever its color may be, then incise it with a superficial cut, as I said in the case of other swellings.
And if the moisture does not exit the wound after insertion, then know that it is fatty. Cut above it with a cross-shaped incision as I have taught you: and hang it with hooks, and remove the skin from all sides easily: and keep kistin over it, if you can, to extract it whole with the knot.
But if the bag bursts during the procedure and it is not possible to extract it whole (for this often happens), then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
For if some little or much remains, the knot will return in great quantity.
But if you are overcome and something remains: then at the end of your procedure fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders; and close the wound, and place a warm compress on it, and care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Therefore if the knot is large, then either its two lips, and care for it with that which causes healing.
But if the pulsating vein is against you or not pulsating: then hurry and fill the zegi place with ground powder, and leave it tightly bound for two days or three until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to cut that which remains from the knot.
Chapter 46
¶ About external instruments for cutting and perforating.
Among them are the forms of intromittal instruments, and they are of three types.
For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one. ︎︎
They should be made of square-ended steel with neatly trimmed edges to hasten entry into the abscess.
And these are the forms of the instruments for probing and puncturing, that is, the piercers; one of them is called beris, that is, the piercer; and there are three types of them.
Of these there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are used to investigate aposteme, issue, fistula, and buboes from the bone between them.
Others are made round, smooth, and soft, like large needles with which to stitch seats, of citron wood, or copper, or iron, or silver.
And the best of them are those made from citron wood.
And experience has also been gained from black lead [graphite], which is suitable to investigate fistulas that have recesses, so that it can glide with them gently into the recesses.
And they are again of three kinds. Because from them there are long ones, and medium-length ones, and short ones, according to the width of the fistula and its constriction.
The shape of hooks is diverse and of many kinds.
Because from them there are simple ones, that is, those which have one curvature; and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
And among them are blind hooks; and they are of three kinds.
And among them are hooks having two curvatures, and they are of three kinds; and among them are hooks having three curvatures, and they are of three kinds; and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of scalpels, with which nodes and aposteme are cut and scraped; and they are of three kinds, because from them there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.  \\
Their tips with which the cutting is done are sharp, the other tips are not sharp; and they are not placed thus except to be of help in scraping nodes when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the sick person may heal through them and find some relief for a while from the burning sensation that is found in scraping an aposteme.
It is made from copper and resembles a ray [of light], with which it makes alcohol: and at its broad end there are hidden small perforations: and through them it runs to the interior and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
The shape of the hidden spatulas that are between the fingers at the perforation of the fistulae: and the sick person does not feel them; and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The forms of the ventuses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
They are made from copper or brass, round, slightly elongated, as you see: and they should be very thin.
And you should have these large and small kinds of ventuses with you: so that you may quickly cut off the blood through them when necessary, and then when there is no medicine at hand.
However, you should not use them to cut off blood in every part of the body, and you should only use them on fleshy parts: such as the thighs of the legs, and the hips, and the arms of the upper limbs, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes they are made into small other instruments similar to the peels of figs, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or an artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this shape.
Chapter 47.
¶ Concerning the treatment of human breasts that resemble female breasts.
Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell at the end of sleep (that is, when they begin to sweat during sleep) until they resemble female breasts: and they remain unpleasantly inflamed.  /> ¶ De cura eorum.
He who abhors that should cut above the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from the line b to the line g. Then remove all the fat. Then fill the wound with healing ointment. Then join the two lips of the wound together with a stitch and care for it until it heals.
If the breast falls downwards and softens because of its size, as happens with women, then two crescent-shaped incisions should be made on both sides of it, each one meeting at the end with the other, so that the larger line encloses the smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Then remove the skin between the two lips and take away the fat, and administer what we said about the stitch and powders, which are necessary for healing, until it heals.
But if you cannot complete the incision that you should make because of the restlessness of the patient or due to bleeding, then you should fill the wound with a cloth soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it corrodes away the remaining fat. Then care for him until he heals.
¶ On the perforation of an abscess that occurs under the nipple.
Chapter XLVIII.
These abscesses that occur under the nipple are of the hard variety of tumors, which contain cysts, and among them are those which contain fluids.
Therefore, those which contain fluids should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from line b to line g. When everything in the abscess has been evacuated as pus, then fill it with an old cloth and leave it until another day.
Then the bandage is removed and it is treated with a suitable ointment until it heals.
If the abscess is of the kind called "Strophuli" knots, then cut over it as we said for cutting over Strophuli equally.
But if the wound spreads to the point of discharging pus, then apply a hot iron to it as we have said previously.
Chapter 49.
On cutting an abscess that occurs because of an artery and vein.
When an artery bursts and the skin above it heals, then often an abscess occurs from there; and similarly this happens with veins, so that an abscess and swelling occur in them.
And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are because of an artery or vein are: because when the abscess is from an artery, it is long, deep within the body; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a crackling sound. ➤
And that which is from a vein is round and visible on the body's surface.
And cutting over this abscess is a mistake, especially if it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very serious. Therefore, its treatment with a knife should be avoided, and that which is also at the extremities or on the head should also be avoided.
Therefore, over what comes from them from an inflammation of the artery opening, find a cut in the skin lengthwise. Then open the cut with hooks, afterwards the artery; and free it from its coatings until it is laid bare.
Then introduce a needle under it and make it penetrate to the other side; and tie off the artery with double thread at two places, as I taught you for extracting two arteries that are in the temples.
Then prick the place that is between the two ligaments with a lancet, until all the blood comes out and the abscess is dissolved.
Then administer a treatment that produces pus, until the ligaments fall off; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If the abscess is due to a cut vein, then you must hold with your hand what you can from the abscess along with the skin. Then insert a needle under the place that you held with your hand, and make it penetrate through; and let there be a double thread in it, until you draw it out from the other side. Then tie it together with the abscess using a good ligature, as I have told you for a grape ligature, from two sides with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread might be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess near the incision of the needle; press down and tie your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is inside comes out; then cut away the excess skin and leave what was tied from it.
Then place on it a little wool that you have soaked in wine and oil. Then administer a treatment made with bandages and ointments, until it heals.
Chapter L.
¶ About the abscess that occurs from the twisting of nerves.
As an abscess can occur in arteries and veins, so too it can occur in nerves; this occurs in them from a blow or from excessive labor and the like. And it happens most frequently in the joints of the fingers or toes, and in every place where the joints move; and it is a severe abscess.
It resembles the color of the rest of the body and is usually painless. However, when it is strongly constricted, the patient feels a numbness similar to that caused by cold.
And there is no abscess formed deep within the body, but rather under the skin, and it can be moved in all directions, neither advancing forward nor backward.
Therefore, if this condition is in the joints, it should not be cut open with a knife. For perhaps contraction may occur.
But if it is on the head or forehead, incise the skin with a scalpel. If, therefore, the abscess is small, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at its root.
And if it is large, then hang it with a hook and peel it off; then remove it and close the wound with stitches; and care for it until it heals.
Chapter LI
¶ On incising an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
It happens to some people very often in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies that there form little swellings which are called fungal tumors because they resemble mushrooms.
Whose root is thin and whose head is thick, and the lips of these tumors are turned inside out. And there are small ones among them; and there are some that grow very large.
And I myself have seen a man who had two of these tumors in his belly, and they were more like mushrooms than anything else; there was no difference between them - they were white, with small roots, and the lips of both turned inside out, and they oozed, and moisture always ran from them.
I then incised them and found that one weighed about eight ounces and the other six ounces. And the operation for incising them is as follows: if the patient is moist and the tumor is white, soft, with a thin root, then incise it with a broad scalpel and have cauteries ready in the fire.
Often indeed much blood is expelled at its section; therefore hasten if you are overcome by blood, then cauterize it.
But if you see the patient is fearful and timid about incision with a blade, then take a well-made leaden thread and tie it around the mole: its method is as we have said, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the constriction of the lead. Therefore do not cease to tie the lead, whenever it presses on the mole, until it is cut off and falls away by itself without effort.
But if the mole is of a large root, then there is something fearful and dreadful about its incision, especially that which is in the abdomen.
Nevertheless, it is possible for you to incise half of it. Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.  />
Then treat it until the wound heals.
And beware of presuming to incise a mole that is black in color, has little sensation, and is ugly in appearance; for it is a cancerous abscess, and I will discuss Cancer after this.
Chapter 52.
§ On the treatment of umbilical hernia.
Umbilical hernia occurs for many reasons. Or from the fissures that are above the abdomen; and an altheb or intestine protrudes from it, just as occurs in other hernias.  />  /> Or from blood that flows out of a vein or artery, as has been stated above.  />  />  />  • Or from constriction of the bowel at that point.  />  •  />
But if it is due to a fissure of the peritoneum and protrusion of fatty tissue, then its color resembles that of the body; it is soft, without pain, and appears in various forms.  />  •  />  />  •  />  > And if it is due to the evacuation of the intestine, then its condition is, along with what we have narrated, more severe in its diversity. When you press it with your fingers, it hides; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it becomes very prominent at the entrance to the bath, and causes great labor.
If, however, it is due to moisture, it is mild; then it does not hide when you press it with your hand, nor does it constrict, nor does it increase.
If it is due to blood, then along with these signs an abscess appears in the form of a blackish swelling.
But if it is due to rotting flesh, then the abscess is heavy, large, hard, and settles in one place.
If, however, it is due to gaseousness, then its touch is gentle.
And the treatment in that case is that you should then consider whether the swelling of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or gaseousness; then it is necessary for you to refrain from treating it. For there is danger and fear in that, as I have taught you in the chapter where I spoke about abscesses due to an artery or vein.
But if the swelling of the navel is due to the intestine or bladder, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath and stand upright and extended.  />   If you do not do this, he will die quickly, as I have informed you in the preceding chapter about a patient who died because he did not hold his breath. Then mark the signs around the entire circumference of the navel with cautery. After that, tell him to turn over onto his back between your hands. Then surround with a wide spatula the place around the navel where you marked with cautery.  />   After that, tell him to turn over onto his stomach between your hands. Then extend the middle of the abscess upward with a large hook. Then bind it around firmly with thread or strong silk cord; let the knot of the binding be loose.
Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the bandage. If you find that it has already been caught by the bandage, then pull out the loose part and insert your index finger into it; push the intestine back into the abdomen. And if you find a hernia, then take hold of it with the hook and cut off its excess.
But if an artery or vein is opposite to you, then circle around it often. Then return to your task. Take two needles and thread two strong threads on them; then introduce the two needles into the circle you have made around the abscess in the form of a cross, making them penetrate through.
Then bind the abscess in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave it alone until the extended flesh putrefies and falls away by itself; or cut it when it softens and putrefies.
Then treat it with the necessary ointments until it heals.
But if the protuberance of the navel is due to fleshiness or moisture, then it is necessary that you make a concave incision in the abscess, as we have said. And extract the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Then treat it with what strengthens the place.
Chapter 53.
¶ On the treatment of CANCER.
We have already spoken in the classification of the kinds of cancer and how to approach its treatment with medicines; and one must be careful in its treatment with iron, so that it does not ulcerate. And we have spoken about cancer generated in the womb and the caution in its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to remove it: such as cancer of the breast or thigh, and similar places, from the limbs for removing all of it; especially when it is small and beginning.
But if it has become chronic and is large, you should not approach it.
For I have not been able to cure anyone from it; nor did I ever see anyone before me who reached that [stage].
And the operation on it, when located as we have said, is that you precede it and dissolve the patient with black bile frequently. Then bloodletting of the patient if a young man with obvious congestion.
Then prepare the patient for preparation, in which he is located during the operation.
Then cast hooks into the cancer that fit it. Then hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood run, and do not cut it quickly, but press on the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever is possible there among the instruments.
But if the flow of thick blood from the cutting of an artery or vein gives you trouble, then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off. Then care for him with the remaining treatment, until he heals.
§ On treating dropsy.
Chapter 45. We have already narrated in the division of the types of dropsy, and how the water accumulates; and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines. 》
And that which is treated with iron is only the sole type of ascites; and the type of tympanites is not approached with iron, nor the type of hypochondriac dropsy at all; for that is fatal.
When you have treated this species of hydrocephalus with medicines and your treatment has not helped, then consider For if the patient has already become weak, or there is another disease with him besides hydrocephalus, such as coughing, or loosening of the bowels, and similar things, then be careful not to treat him with iron, for it is dangerous.
But if you see that the patient is of strong constitution and there is no other disease with him except hydrocephalus alone, and he is neither a boy nor an old man, then the manner of operating on him is as follows: You raise the patient standing between your hands, and an assistant behind him presses his abdomen with his hand, forcing the water down to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a thorny sponge, in this manner. It should be of two sharp points, long, with a sharp end like a little sponge. However, there should be something of gradual narrowness in it, so that you do not penetrate with it during the operation all the way to the intestine and injure it.
Then consider. For if the hydrocephalus is generated from the part of the intestines, then you must extend the cut with a section from the navel for the length of three fingers, downwards directly above the chest.
But if the hydrocephalus is generated on account of liver disease, then your cut should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its origin is on account of the spleen, then let the cut be on the right side; and it should not even be on the side where the patient wishes to lie, so that the superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Then pierce the whole skin with the instrument. Then introduce the sponge into that section, and lift your hand with the sponge under the skin, as if you are removing it; and let the amount that is removed be the size of a nail or about that.
Then pierce the tissues until you reach an empty space, which is a place of water. Then extract it and insert this tool into the opening, whose shape is as follows. And it is similar to a tube; it is made of silver, bronze, or brass, smooth and polished. At its lower end there is a small opening, and on its sides there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other. And the tip of it is cut in the manner of cutting a reed, as you see; at its upper end there is a ring.
For when the tool reaches the water, then the fluid immediately rises over the tool; therefore, draw out of the water half a measure's quantity per hour.
Because if you draw out of it more than is necessary, the patient may die within the hour through the dissipation of his vital spirit; or he may fall into a swoon that approaches death.
Truly, draw out of it according to the strength of it and according to what the condition of the patient indicates to you from the strength of his pulse and from its goodness.
Then remove the tool and retain the water.
That is, because it is immediately retained due to the skin which retains the opening that is above the tissue; about which I have told you to pierce it in that manner.
Then repeat the procedure with the tool on the following day, if you see the patient tolerating it; and draw out from the water also a small quantity.
Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself against error; until there remains from the water only a little.
But if you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of fluid, then care for him with burial in hot sand, and much sweating in the bath and sunlight, and let him expect thirst; and care for him with drying medicines until he is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, spleen, and liver after drawing out the water; as I have told you in what has preceded.
On the care of infants born with their urethral openings not pierced through.
Chapter LV.
When any infant comes out of its mother's womb and its penis is not pierced through, or there is a narrow opening, or it is in the wrong place.
Therefore, one must immediately assist with its perforation at birth using a very fine sound, in the following manner.
Then place a fine lead weight into the opening and tie it on: and hold it for three or four days.
Therefore, when he wishes to release his urine, remove it and let him urinate. Then replace it.
And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine which comes upon that spot will not allow it to close.
The one whose opening is narrow should be treated with lead as we said, for many days, until it opens up.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are harmed. That is to say, because in those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis, so he cannot urinate forward until he raises his penis with his hand upwards. ‌ Nor can he have intercourse, for the semen cannot reach the womb directly; and it is very offensive. ‌ ‌
And the manner of operating on him is that the patient be turned onto his back. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ Then extend his penis with your left hand using a strong extension, and cut off the head of the penis from the location of the glans with a needle or sharp sound, like when you cut a reed, or as if you are shaving something, so that its middle part becomes similar to the head of the penis; and let the opening fall in the middle as it should.
And beware of blood loss during your procedure. For this often happens. Therefore, stop the bleeding with what you used to cut, and care for the wound until it heals.
About whiteheads that occur on the foreskin and head of the penis, and about pus, blackening, and adhesions.
Chapter 66.
These whiteheads often occur on the penis, and they are foul-smelling lumps of flesh.
And some are malignant, while others are not.
Therefore, you should cut away the benign one with a fine hook until you have completely cleaned it out. ))) )))) Then place on it a piece of cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then care for the area with diafincion ointment until it heals.
But if the whitehead is malignant and foul-smelling, then you should apply a cautery to it after cutting it open and removing its core. ))) )))) )))
But if the whitehead is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised man and part of it is inside the foreskin while another part is outside: then you should remove the inner part of the whitehead first, until it has healed; only then should you care for the outer part. Because when you care for both parts at once, the foreskin may be damaged and retracted. )))
Blackening and corruption also occur on the scrotum and foreskin. ))) )))) )))) ))) ))) Therefore, you should cut out all that has blackened or is about to decay or has already decayed. )))
Then apply to the area a mixture of pounded honey with ground-up cornflour and sifted crushed herbs. ))) ))))
Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. ))) )))) ))) )))
If there is a flow of blood, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery in this manner.
A cautery is beneficial for two conditions at the same time: namely for a flow of blood and for a wound when it becomes corrupt.
But if the tip of the rod is corroded and destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary that you insert a lead pipe into the meatus of the penis so that the patient urinates onto it.
In the case of adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, this adhesion does not occur except in a man whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required for him; and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess: Therefore, it is necessary that you scrape it off with a blunt spatula until the ligament dissolves and the head of the penis is freed from every part. ︎
But if it is difficult to discern these carefully, then it is necessary that you scrape off a little from the head of the penis and the foreskin. This is because when the foreskin is thin, it may be quickly perforated due to its very thinness.
Then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then it should be scraped with astringent wine until it heals.

¶ On the cleaning of infants and their treatment when they err.
Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is by our operation, by our will, and its use is proper for children, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation and a lighter way leading to health.
I say therefore that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, since they do not use it in their laws, and there is nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
For I have found that most artisans and bloodletters use cleaning, cutting with a razor, and using scissors; and they use cauterization and tying with thread, and cutting with a nail.
And indeed, I have already tested all these methods, and I found no better one than cleaning with scissors and tying with thread.
Since in cleaning with a razor, the skin often slips away. Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers; therefore, perhaps the upper layer is cut and the lower one remains; thus it will be necessary to proceed with cutting the other one, and there will be future pain.  /> And with cleaning done by cauterization, that is, by the digitus which shoemakers use, the cutting of the end of the male member is not secure; since perhaps it enters into its hole.
But in cleaning with a nail, perhaps the iron slips away and ruins your operation; and indeed, the skin of a child is short by nature, and often they are born in such a way that they do not need cleaning; and I have already seen this.
But cleaning with scissors and tying with thread has shown me to be a good experiment; since the scissors are proportionate to the incision; because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below. When therefore you place your hand thus, the two sharpnesses are proportionate, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a compression of similar shape is made, containing the skin from all parts, with which no error falls at all.  />  />
And the manner of operation is this: make the boy estimate, especially if he is one of those who understands a little, that you do not do anything unless you tie a thread on his rod only; and leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be glad as much as you can, because he receives his understanding. Then make him stand between your prepared hands and do not let him sit; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Then introduce your hand to his rod and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the rod comes out. Then cleanse it because filth will gather upon it.
Then bind the marked place with a double thread. After that, bind below it slightly with the second tie. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower tie firmly, and cut between the two ties. Then quickly lift up the skin and pull out the head of the rod. Then let the blood flow out slowly (for this is better) and place powder on top of it; and over the powder a cloth in which a cooked egg yolk has been spread with fresh good rose oil that has been mixed together: and leave him on it until another day, and care for him with the remaining treatment until he is cured.
The form of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Let there be two blunt ends and let them meet; so that the branch of the nail does not stick out in them; and let the length of the two sharp parts be equal to the length of the handles.
The error falling in cleansing is this: because perhaps all or part of the inner skin escaped at the incision.
Therefore, you should stretch it with your nail at the appointed hour before the swelling of the place, and cut it according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
But if three days have passed and the swelling under the rod remains inflamed and swollen, then leave it alone until the hot swelling subsides; then scrape it off with ease, cut it as prepared for you, and beware of the tip of the rod. For that will not harm him.
Take care of it with what heals wounds from the powders that we have described in the treatise on powders; and if it is cut too deeply through the skin and reaches the upper parts, that will not harm him either.
Therefore take care of it with what we have said, until it heals.
Chapter 58.
¶ Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by a stone made from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh, and similar things as we have said in the modes of treatment in the division.
And if the urine does not dissolve and you see that its retention is due to a stone already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary for him to be bent over his knees. Then let his feet be placed on his back, and let him stretch his belly from the top of his back, and let the patient hold his breath as much as possible for him.  Bible in Latin Therefore he is forced with the neck of the bladder to expel the stone toward the rear, wherefore the urine is freed.  Bible in Latin  Bible in Latin
But if it does not dissolve with what we have said and the matter is severe for the patient, then you must administer its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: Let it be made of silver and be fine, smooth, hollow like a feather quill in delicacy, long like a hand and a half; to which there should be a fine tube at its end.
And the way of the exit of urine through it is that you take a doubled thread and tie wool or cotton to its end with a good ligature: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut off any excess wool with scissors, but forcefully insert it into the cannula, as alzer.
Then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and the white of an egg: and make the sick person sit on a seat, and pack the bladder, and its rod with moistened oils and olive oil and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the rod easily, until it reaches the base of the rod.
Then fold it upwards from the navel part.
Then push the syringe inside, until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has now reached an empty space: and this is not done according to this order, unless because the passage through which it goes is where there is a curvature.
Then gradually extend the thread with the wool. For urine will follow the wool.
Then draw it out and let the urine run through its path: and repeat with the syringe, and do not stop doing this, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ On the method of irrigating the bladder with a syringe.
Chapter 59.
When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals therein, or pus becomes hardened within it, and one wishes to distill waters and medicines into it: then let it be done with an instrument called a Clepshydra, and this is its form.  (Albucasis on Surgery, trans. by Donald Campbell)
For it is closed, that is to say, it is sealed. And in it there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow place where that which drives is located should be according to its size without addition, until when it draws something with it from moisture, moisture is drawn: and when it is driven, with it what is far off is expelled; just as a clepsydra does, by means of which naphtha, which is Greek fire, is projected in the battles of Mars.
When you want to project moisture into the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and draw it along with what drives upwards; for moisture is drawn into the hollow of the syringe.
Then insert its tip into a tube, as we have described in the syringe. Then drive the moisture along with what drives it; for that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it.
The form of a thin enema by which the bladder is irrigated.
Let it be made of silver or brass; and let its tip be similar to a small onion, and below that let there be a pouch into which the thread falls.
Then take a sheep's bladder and place in it the moisture with which you want to irrigate the bladder. Then tie it between two pouches with a strong double thread; and warm that moisture a little over the fire.
Then insert the tip of the enema into a tube; afterwards place your hand over the bladder with the moisture in a moderate constriction until the patient feels that that moisture has already reached the bladder.
But if a bladder is not available to you, then take a piece of parchment and make from it a circle, and pierce it all around its circumference.  /> Then tie the ends of that thread on either side of the perforated parchment with a strong knot; and place that moisture in the middle of the parchment; and do what you have been told about irrigation. Then introduce a thread through those holes, as they are rolled up. Then make a ball like an apple; after you have placed on it what you wish from the moist substances and oils and waters.
Then bind it to the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder when squeezing it by hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
¶ About the Removal of a Stone.
We have already spoken of the types of stone and its treatment with medicines, and we mentioned the difference between stones generated in the kidneys, the bladder, and all their signs; and we spoke about the stone on which the operation by hand and incision works, and that is properly a stone generated in the bladder, and the one that fixes itself to the urethra. And I am explaining this with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder most often happens to boys.
And its sign is that the urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety, and white sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his penis, and struggles with it, and often dribbles. Then he becomes erect, and the anus protrudes in many of them.
And boys are easy to cure from that time until they reach fourteen years. And it is difficult in old men. But in young men it is intermediate, in that if the stone is larger, the cure is easier; but if it is small, its treatment is difficult.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with an enema, which should draw out all the excrement that is in his intestines; for this sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during the search.
Then let the patient be taken with his feet, and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the stone may descend to the depth of the bladder, or jump out from a high place several times.
Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his own thighs, so that the entire bladder may become inclined downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him from the outside.
If indeed you feel the stone in a space, then hasten immediately with a cut over it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wash the index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a boy; or the middle finger, if he is an adult man, and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn him little by little towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press over it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place where you want to make the incision; and instruct an assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand to move away the skin that is under the testicles from the place where the incision is.
Then insert a sharp instrument of this shape. And find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left buttock: and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the external part of the incision may be wide, and the internal part narrow, according to what is possible for the passage of the stone out of it not being greater. ‌
For perhaps the finger that is in the anus may press the stone at the incision, and it goes out without difficulty.
And know that it is from stone which has angles and edges, therefore its outlet is difficult because of this.
And it is smooth, similar to a little ball, and round; and its outlet becomes easy.
Therefore, for the one which has angles and edges, add into a crack.
If it does not exit in this way, then you must create an opening above it; or tie a knot around it neatly, whose end is like the moon, which should hold the stone and not let it escape from there; or insert beneath it a thin instrument with a curved tip.
If, however, you cannot do so above it, then slightly enlarge the opening. If anything overcomes you from bleeding, cut it off with a thread.
But if the stone is more than one, then first expel the larger one towards the mouth of the bladder. Then make an incision above it. Afterwards, push the smaller one after that; and do similarly if there are more than two.
If it is very large, it is ignorance to make an incision above it with a large cut. Because one of two things happens to the patient, either that he dies, or continuous dribbling of urine occurs; therefore, because the place does not heal at all.
Truly, administer its expulsion until it comes out; or make an opening in its fracture with scissors, until you extract it bit by bit.
When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with incense, aloe, and dragon's blood; and tie it off, and place upon it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil and cold water; to treat a hot abscess.
Then place the patient on their back over their shoulder, and do not loosen the tie until the third day. When you have loosened it, rinse the place with water and a lot of oil.
Then care for it with diaphanic ointment and basilicum ointment until it heals.
However, if it happens that in a wound there is added an abscess of heat and ulceration, similar to when blood clots in the bladder and urine is blocked from it, and this is known from the emission of blood with urine. Insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood. For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar and water and salt. And apply every kind of ointment suitable for its treatment until it heals.
And during the entire time of treatment, you should bind two thighs together to hold the medicines that are placed on the site.
If the stone is small and it is stuck in the channel of the urethra and blocks the passage of urine, then treat it with that which I have previously mentioned before you proceed to cutting. For often you will be relieved of cutting through this treatment, for I have already proven its effectiveness.
And it is necessary that you take a perforating tool made of steel, with this form: triangular at the end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread and tie it to the rod beneath the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the piercing iron into the rod easily until the perforator reaches the stone itself, and gradually turn the perforator by hand in the stone, and you will try to make a hole in it until you cause it to penetrate from the other side.
For immediately urine is freed.
Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outer part of the rod. For it breaks up and comes out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another thread above the stone. Then cut over the stone on the rod itself between the two ties. Then extract it. Afterwards, loosen the bandage and clean the frozen blood that forms at the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone unless to prevent it from returning to the bladder; and another thread above, unless so that when the thread is untied after the passage of the stone, the skin may return to its place and cover the wound; and for this reason it is necessary for you when tying the thread above to raise the skin upward, so that it returns in its entirety and covers the wound, as we have said.
Chapter 61.
About the removal of stones in women.
Stones are rarely formed in women. />
But if it happens that a woman gets a stone, then the treatment is difficult and is hindered by many factors.
One of them is that the woman may be a virgin.
And another factor is that you cannot find a woman who will expose herself to a doctor when she is chaste or has a husband.  />  Et si inuenies illam raro et difficulter.
The third factor is that you cannot find a woman well-versed in this skill, especially the manual operation.
And the fourth factor is the distance from the site of the stone, which requires deep incision and involves fear.
If necessity calls for it, then you must have a woman doctor who is skilled; and such a one is rarely found.   Si autem necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.
If indeed you lack such things, then seek a clean, skilled physician and a present midwife well-versed in women's matters or a woman who is knowledgeable in this art; make her present and especially instruct her to do everything that you command her after the examination of the stone.
First, observe whether the woman is a virgin; then it is necessary that she insert her finger into her anus and seek for the stone.
If she finds it, let her squeeze it with her finger. Then command the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vulva and examine the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it firmly.
If she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength until it reaches the hip joint.
Then make an incision over it on the opposite side of the vulva at the hip joint, whichever part is prepared for her and where she feels the stone; and let her finger not be moved away from the stone, squeezing it tightly beneath; and let the incision be small at first. ))) Then insert a probe over that incision.
Then insert a probe over that incision. If she feels the stone, then enlarge the incision according to the proportion by which the stone exits from her.
And know that there are many types of stones. Among these are those that are small and large, smooth and rough, long, round, and branched. )))
Know therefore its types, so that you may be informed about it as you wish.
If blood overpowers you, then add ground fenugreek to the place and hold it for one hour until the bleeding stops.
Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and make sure you have ready with you from the instruments which I mentioned for extracting stones in men, so that you may assist yourself with them in your operation.
If you are overwhelmed by the flow of blood and know that the bleeding is from the cut artery, then place dust over the site and bind it with a decent ligature: and do not change it; and leave the stone and do not remove it. Perhaps a weak woman may die. Then care for the wound.
Therefore, when the sharpness of the blood subsides after a few days and the site begins to fester, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
Chapter 62
§ On incision for hydrocele.
A watery hernia is not anything other than a collection of fluid in the white sac, which contains the testicle and is under the skin: and it is called a sac.
And sometimes it is in the proper membrane which nature has prepared for the testicle in its own part, until it becomes swollen; that is another sac, and it is between the white sac which we mentioned and the skin of the testicle, and this only happens rarely.
And indeed the formation of this hernia is from a weakness that befalls the testicles, wherefore this material flows to them. And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles. ‌
And this fluid has many colors. ‌ ‌ ‌ For its color either tends toward yellowish, or it is blood-red, or dirty black, or it can be watery white; and the latter is most common.
And the signs by which you know where the collection of fluid is, are these. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ For if it is in the white sac which we mentioned, then the swelling is round to a certain length like the shape of an egg; and the testicle does not appear, since the fluid holds it on all sides.
And if there is moisture in its own cloth, then the abscess is round with a part of an egg, and therefore man thinks that it is another egg.
And if there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the membrane around the testes, then it is not perceptible.
Therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, then try the color of the moisture in the abscess with the previously described square instrument. According to that which comes out in the trace of the inserted [instrument], judge what is between them.
When we come to the treatment with iron [i.e., cautery], then it is necessary that you instruct the patient that he should be bled if possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then let him lie on his back over a slightly elevated object, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit on his left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on his right side, who should stretch the member towards one of the two sides of the scrotal skin and towards the edge of the abdomen.
Then take a wide spatula and cut the skin of the scrotum lengthwise from the middle to near the penis, and let the incision be straight along an equidistant line that divides the scrotal skin, until it reaches the membrane around the testes enclosing it: and excoriate it and observe, or be careful not to cut it: and let your excoriation by which you excoriate it be from the side that hangs with the egg more, and search subtly with the excoriation according to what is possible for you.
Then pierce the full membrane around the testes with a large opening and extract all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks and extend the membrane upwards, but do not touch the scrotal skin enclosing it: and cut the membrane in whatever way you can cut it, either entirely or piecemeal, especially its thin side. Indeed, if you do not carefully examine it, there is no certainty that water will not return upon its incision.
But if the egg proceeds outward from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision, return it. Then unite the two lips of the scrotal skin with a suture.
Then treat him as you would other wounds until he is healed.
But if you find a putrid egg from blackness or other means, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are the suspension, fearing the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with its suspending ligament and extract the egg; afterwards treat it as we have said.
But if water has gathered in two parts, then know that there are two branches; cut the other part equally as you did with the first.
And if it appears to you that the operation is one, then do so; afterwards remove the blood. And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose-scented oil; and place outward another wool that you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles and the navel; and place above double cloths, and they are soft; and tie them above with a ligature which has six, in this form. ➤
Then two cloths should be taken and wrung out, and filled with flax soaked in wine, according to this manner: and their ends which are pressed from cotton or wet wool; and they should be gathered together with a bandage in the lower part of the loins: and one end should extend from the anus up to the back, and the second from the pubic region: and two ends below on both thighs, and two other ends above on both groins, and let the whole bandage be gathered together in the lower part of the loins.
And sometimes this pampiniformis is treated artificially with a caustic in place of a surgical cut with iron: and it is done by taking a thin, sharp cautery, and cutting the skin of the testicles with it; and it is heated as we have said; until, when the white membrane containing water appears, then take a cautery of this shape.
It resembles the Greek letter.
Then pierce that membrane with it, and heat until all the moisture comes out.
Then stretch that membrane with hooks and remove it with a thin heated cautery, and cut it as much as you can until you completely excise it.
And beware of the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and less likely to cause bleeding, and better than the operation with cutting.
But if it causes a problem at the time of cutting or heating, such as a hot abscess, bleeding, or anything else, then you should treat that problem with the appropriate treatment, as mentioned before.
But if the patient is timid and cannot endure this operation because of its horror, then perform a puncture as I describe it, which is:
When you are certain from the signs that we have mentioned about their meanings, that the pampiniformis is watery, then it is necessary to make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then puncture the abscess at its lower part with a wide spatula; and make the puncture along the length of the body, and let the opening be large until all the water runs out.
Then place a compress on the wound and bind it; and let the patient sit so that any remaining water can drain; then care for him until the wound heals.
If however there is obstruction to the exit of water at the time you perforate it; and this is only because the white membrane causes an obstruction at the wound's opening and prevents the water from exiting, then it is necessary that you introduce a feather into the wound, or the instrument with which water is extracted from dropsical patients, of which the shape precedes; or add a little to the operation of the wound.
And know that water returns and accumulates after six months, or thereabouts. Therefore, when it accumulates, then it should be punctured in the same manner, and the patient will pass his days.
Chapter LXIII
¶ On the Treatment of Flesh Wounds
Know that in the cutting of this flesh wound, there is fear of leading to death in many situations. Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal will be saved from it.
And I am remembering the procedure on it and the appearance of the abscess. 》
I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the body, from which testicles are formed; and this happens for many reasons, namely.
Or from an acute or sharp overflow that is poured out onto the testicles. Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and the abscess is serious.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation of it. 》 》
And sometimes it occurs from the knotting and swelling of the arteries, as has been mentioned before; or from the swelling of the veins.
Therefore, that which is from them and occurs due to the swelling of the arteries can be recognized by the arrangement of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers. And you should not touch it at all.
But that which is caused by the inflammation of veins, nothing is dispersed from it during compression with fingers.
And now it is possible to perform a section on this type and on the other flesh: namely, to excise the skin of the testicles. Then extend the ovum upwards and extract it with the white siphak; free the suspensor from the vessel, tie the vessel, and cut the suspensor after you have freed it from all parts of the ovum.
Therefore, if the ovum is conjoined with those born flesh, then it is necessary to draw out the ovum and cut into it.
And if there is any adhesion between the ovum and the siphak or between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut into it with a round incision.
But if there is a birth of flesh in the place of the adhesion behind it, then it is necessary to cut out all that and extract the ovum as we have said.  /// The medieval Latin text "Albucasis on Surgery" (Latin: Kitāb al-Tasrīf li-man ʿAjiz ʿan al-taʿlīf) is a translation of the 10th century Arabic medical text by Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn Abbas Al-Zahrawi, also known as Albucasis. This passage describes the procedure for extracting an ovum (possibly a cyst or abscess) that is adhered to surrounding tissue. The instructions include extending and drawing out the ovum, freeing it from any adhesions, and making round incisions as necessary.
Therefore, when your operation is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the usual treatment until it heals.
Chapter LXIV.
¶ On the treatment of rams, which are with goats.
The goat has a swelling wrapped in a certain wrapping, similar to a grape cluster, with softening of the testicles; and there is difficulty in moving, exercise, and walking.
And in the treatment of this illness, one should be cautious, because of what was mentioned earlier.
Truly, we must say that its operation is according to what the first [surgeons] did.
Therefore, I say that it is necessary for you to make the patient sit on a raised seat. Then, push the scrotum downwards. Then, with your fingers, hold the skin of the scrotum together with the vessels that are close to the penis; and let another assistant hold them, and stretch them with great force.
Then, cut with a sharp, broad scalpel across the vessels directly until the vessels are exposed.
Then, scrape [the vessels] from all sides, as we have told you in the extraction of the temporal arteries.
Then, insert into them a needle with a double thread, and tie it first at the place where the veins meet; and then tie it again at their end. Then, cut them along the middle line following the length of the body, and remove what accumulates from foul, corrupted humors.
Then, treat the wound as you would other wounds, in which there is power to generate pus, so that the vessels nourishing one of the testicles may fall away. For it is not harmful through this [procedure].
But if the veins are attached to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed with them; so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and it rots or dries up, and there is no benefit from them [the testicles].  />
Chapter LXV.
¶ On the treatment of intestinal worms.
The onset of these worms is due to a cutting that occurs in the groin when extending the intestine over the abdomen during laparotomy.  /> />  Note: "laparotomy" is used here as a translation for the Arabic term "mirach," which refers to a surgical incision into the abdominal cavity.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles? And this rupture is either from a hernia or from its stretching.
And these two types occur for many reasons: either from a blow, or from a jump, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy thing, and similar causes.
And the sign, when it is from stretching of the hernia. It happens gradually over a long time, and not suddenly; and it is an equal swelling towards the depth, because the hernia compresses the intestine.
And its sign when it is from cutting of the hernia, because it causes a sudden, severe pain at the beginning; and it is a different swelling, appearing close to the skin: and this is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the outside of the hernia. xspace
And sometimes it exits with the intestine, an omentum; and this is called hernia of the intestines and omentum; and sometimes it occurs with flatulence.
And sometimes feces run into the intestine and are retained there; and with it is the danger of the sick person; because it causes a painful swelling, especially when it is pressed.
And in treating these types of illness with iron, there is danger; therefore, one must be careful to avoid this happening.
And the method of treatment is that you should instruct the sick person to return the intestine with his own hand to the inside of his abdomen, if it obeys and returns. Then he should be made to lie on his back between your hands, and you should raise his legs.
Then stretch the skin that follows the other skin towards above, and cut the entire skin of the testicles along their length. xspace Then place hooks in the two lips of the incision, as you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be such that it is possible for an egg to pass through it.  xspace xthe operation should not be done on a full stomach, nor on an empty one; rather, when the intestines are neither too full nor too empty.
Then scrape the scrotum and what is under the skin of the testicles until when the white sac is exposed, hard on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, between the white sac that is under the skin of the egg and the second sac, and separate with it the adhesion that is at the back of the egg.
Then with the right hand move towards the interior of the skin of the testicles; and with this extend the white sac upwards with the left hand; and lift the egg with its sac to the section area; and command your assistant to raise the egg up; and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind upon completion.
And search with your fingers so that there is nothing there of the intestine wrapped in the hard white sac. If however you find something from it, then push it down to the belly.
Then take a needle with a thick thread, made of ten threads; and insert it at the last sac, that is, the tunica which is under the skin of the testicles following the section; then cut off the ends that protrude from the thread until there are four threads. Then arrange some of them over others in the shape of a cross; and tie with them the sac about which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, so that nothing from the vessels that nourish them may be sent to them; lest a hot abscess arise from there. And place another ligature outside the first ligature, more distant by two fingers' width. And after these two ligatures cut from the sac that is under the skin of the testicles a quantity equal to the size of a finger; and cut the rest completely around in a circle, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut the skin of the testicles in the lower part where blood and pus flow out, as we have mentioned previously.
Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound and use the bandage that we have mentioned. And sometimes cauterize the white sifach that we have mentioned after its incision, fearing a flow of blood. For this often happens. And leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if its fall is delayed, then soak it in warm water and place the aforementioned [herb] on it until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the usual treatment for wounds until it is cured.
Chapter LXVI.
¶ On Ventose Ramica.
In this case of ventose ramica, I have not seen anyone who dares to treat it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is treated as we have mentioned in the case of ramica with Vite. Which is to say that after the incision, place the bandage below with ease; then cut in the middle and treat it lastly with what opens it up until the vessels fall off; and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.
Chapter LXVII.
¶ On Disruption that Occurs in the Groin.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing comes out from the intestines to the testicles; and if something does come out, it is little and returns at all times; but if this persists for a long time, a fissure is added in the sifach until the intestine descends into the sifach.
And this happens due to the expansion of the sifach that is in the groin, as we have said. "The reason is that the skin is stretched; then it becomes soft and swollen, and protrudes.
"And its treatment is with a cautery, as was previously stated in its description.
"And sometimes it is treated with an iron instrument in this manner: the patient should lie on his back between your hands. "Then cut the swollen and protruding area of the rupture with a transverse incision, the length of which should be three fingers wide.
"Then tie off the skin and what lies beneath it until the white skin that follows is exposed.
"Then take a needle and place it on the protruding part of the skin, pressing it down into the belly.
"Then if there are two protruding parts on the skin at the end of the needle, join them together with a stitch; then pull out the end of the needle.
"And do not cut the skin at all, nor draw out any pus or other matter, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal adhesions.
"Then treat it with wound care. "Therefore, when you cut the threads, cleanse the area and close the wound until it heals.
"For the skin contracts, and no further protrusion of the rupture occurs.
"And the use of a cautery is better in this case because it is closer to healing.
Chapter 68.
"About softening the skin of the testicles.
"The skin of the testicles often becomes soft in certain people, and because of this, the meat between them becomes softened, and their appearance is disfigured.
"Therefore, it is necessary for the one asked to treat this that he make the patient lie on his back and cut away all the softened skin down to the natural skin.
Then gather the two lips with a stitch: and if you wish, first remove the excess skin with three or four stitches, and make the stitch firm.
Then cut between the stitches.
Then care for the healing of the remaining wounds until they heal and the threads fall out.
Chapter LXIX.
§ On Castration
Know that castration in our law is excommunicated: and because of this I might not mention it in this book of mine; and there would be no need to mention it except for two reasons.
One is so that it may be within the knowledge of a doctor when he is asked about it; and so that he may know how to treat the one to whom it has happened.
And the other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals for our benefit, such as rams, donkeys, and cats, and similar animals.
I say therefore that castration is done in two ways. Either by crushing.  ...or by cutting. Or by tearing and cutting.
In that which is done by crushing, the way of the operation is this: that we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles become soft and relaxed and hang down; then crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not felt under touch.
However, in castration by tearing and cutting, it is necessary for you to hold the animal and press its skin on its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut above each testicle with a single cut until two testicles come out; then cut them after you have skinned both, and do not leave anything of the fat except for the fine fat which is on the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by crushing; because crushing perhaps leaves something of the testicles, on account of which the animal desires coitus.  ...But the one done by cutting and tearing is safer for the animal.
Then tend to the wound until it heals.
Chapter 70
On the care of two types of hermaphrodites.
A hermaphrodite is from men in two ways. One of them is that it appears on what follows the space, or on the skin of the testicles, between two testicles, like a woman's vulva with hairs in it; and sometimes urine comes out from what is on the skin of the testicles.
However, in women there is only one kind, and it is a woman's vulva above the pubis like very small male testicles protruding to the outside; one of them is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles. xspace
And the treatment of these three kinds, two from men and one from women, is this: you should cut away the added flesh until their imprint disappears. Then treat them with the same care as for other wounds.
As for the second type of men, from which urine comes out, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation and it has no treatment at all. ️
Chapter 71.
¶ On the incision of the dark spot and protruding flesh in women's labia.
Perhaps a dark spot is added to the natural state until it becomes ugly and unpleasant to look at; and sometimes it becomes so large in some women that it spreads like in men, even reaching the point of intercourse.
Therefore, you should hold the excess of the dark spot with your hand or with a hook and cut it; and do not go too deep in the incision, especially at the root, so that bleeding does not occur.
Then treat it with the same care as for other wounds until it heals.
Protruding flesh is the flesh that grows in the opening of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it comes out to the outside like a tail, and because of this some ancients called it "tail disease. We should therefore cut it as we cut the tonsil and care for it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of al-Ratidh, which is the woman's unperforated lip.
Chapter 72.
The al-Ratidh is when the woman's lip is unperforated or has a small opening. And it may be either congenital or acquired.
The acquired form comes from an antecedent illness: it is caused either by a growth of flesh, or by a delicate or thick sifach (ulcer/sinus), and it may occur either deep in the womb, or on its sides, or at its upper or lower part; it prevents sexual intercourse, conception, childbirth, and possibly menstruation. ︎
Its diagnosis is made by the midwife's inspection if the swelling is apparent nearby.
If it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or a rod.
But if the swelling is due to a delicate sifach and is close to the two lips, then hasten and break it up.
And it is done by placing small cushions on the two lips.
Then place the index fingers of both your hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread apart. Then strongly stretch the two lips until the delicate sifach is broken and the swelling opens.
Then take wool, dip it in oil and place it on the spot; and let the woman sit every day so that the site does not heal again with a different kind of flesh.
But if the sifach is thick and dense, then it should be cut away with a broad scalpel like a myrtle leaf. ︎ ︎ ︎
But if the swelling is due to a growth of flesh, then suspend it with hooks and cut it; and let there be with you medicines which staunch blood flow without causing tissue necrosis, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and cooked chickpeas with egg membrane. ︎ ︎
Then administer a wide leaden tube so that the wound does not heal quickly; let her keep it for several days: and administer a bandage of dry linen, then proceed with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And sometimes a growth of other flesh occurs in the womb; it is therefore necessary to cut according to this method: while it is not a cancerous swelling, for with a cancerous swelling that is in the womb, there should be no contrariety whatsoever with iron.
Chapter 73.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, as well as Bothrus red in women's wounds.
Indeed, hemorrhoids are the opening of the mouths of veins, until much blood runs out from them continually.
When hemorrhoids age, they become piles. And I have already said in the division of their types and signs. Here I will say what among them receives treatment and what does not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are at the mouth of the womb and do not appear to be sensible, then there is no treatment for them with iron.
But those which are at the mouth of the womb and upon which sensation falls, these can be treated.
It is therefore necessary to introduce the woman into a cold room. Then extend the piles with scissors or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then sprinkle upon them at the time of bleeding from one powder made without boiling: like acacia and dragon's blood, henna, and similar to these.
Then press her feet against the wall for one hour. Afterwards, place her in cold water.
If the bleeding persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peels and oak galls and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on its back.
If therefore the blood is cut with it, that is good; and if not, make windy (plasters) stick to the back and breasts without scraping.
Then take wool and soak it in the juice of tamarind or the juice of sea-bass or the juice of laurel branches, that is, laurel berries, with Pontic wine, and make it stick to the place.
Therefore, when the abscess quiets down, then treat the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth, however, is similar to red onion bulbs and has a rough appearance.
Therefore you should cut what appears from it, as I said about the lily, evenly; and treat it until it heals.
Chapter 74.
¶ About the Perforation of the Uterus that Happens in the Womb.
Many types of abscesses happen in the womb, such as cancer, lapis abscess, ulcers, adubelati (a type of skin lesion), alekilati (herpes), aestiomemus (a type of wound), fistulas, hemorrhoids, ragadiae (tears or fissures), thelil (a type of abscess), and hot abscess.
And I have already mentioned all these diseases and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the section on division; it is necessary that I mention here the hot abscess that happens in the womb, when it is one of the abscesses that collect pus, and (I) wish to know how its opening with iron (is done).
Therefore you should consider.  /> Then if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is sharp with throbbing and burning and fever, and you see it redden; if this sense falls upon it, then do not hasten to pierce it; and treat it with what helps for maturation, until when the acuteness of the accidents quiets down.
Then you should have the woman sit on a seat with two hollows, and lean back, or lie on her back, and draw up her feet towards her lower abdomen: her thighs should be spread apart, and she should place her arms under her knees, and each one should be tied with a suitable ligature.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument to open the vagina.
And when you want to administer this instrument, you should first probe the depth of the woman's vagina with a reed, so that what enters from the instrument is not deeper than the depth of the vagina, and thus does not harm the patient.
If however the instrument is longer than the depth, then you should place wool over the depth of the vagina, so that the entire instrument does not enter into the depth of the vagina: and you should put a handle on the instrument from the upper side, and hold the instrument, and have an assistant turn the handle until the vagina is opened.
When therefore the presenting part appears and is felt by the hand as soft and pliable, then you should cut it off at its head with a broad scalpel.
When therefore the blood has been evacuated, then you should put on the wound a linen bandage soaked in rose oil or green oil that has some styptic power: and put the bandage in place, and draw out the cut into the depth of the vagina.
And put on the outside over the vagina and over the pubic hair clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then let it be scraped after two days with a suitable ointment, until it heals.
And sometimes the vagina and wound are washed with water and honey enema; then with water in which lily root or long birthwort has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary to avoid treating it with iron; rather, treat it with what we mentioned in the division.
Chapter 70
The teaching of midwives, how to care for live embryos that have exited abnormally.
It is necessary for the midwife to know first the shape of a normal delivery.
Therefore the signs of a normal delivery are as follows: when you see the woman being pressed downwards, and she desires fresh air, and what is above her on the birthstool is relieved, and the embryo hastens to exit: then know that this delivery is according to the natural shape, and its exit is over its head, and with it comes the afterbirth, either suspended or hanging from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, it is necessary to press her abdomen so that the embryo descends quickly.
For when it descends over its head, the afterbirth follows with it, and is cleansed of those superfluities by a good cleansing.
But that which is different from this delivery is unnatural and praiseworthy.
Because sometimes the fetus exits over its feet, and its body comes out before its head, or both of its feet, or one foot; or it exits with its head and hand; or its belly exits first; and perhaps it turns over its neck, and similar shapes are praiseworthy.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and astute in all these things, and to guard herself from error and deception; and I will show every shape of them, and what skill there is in that, and it will be indicated by that, and she will stand firm on that.
When the fetus exits over its head in its natural exit, and that becomes very difficult for the woman, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit on a stool, or let women hold her; and steam her vulva with cooked fenugreek and wet oils.
Then the midwife should insert a small sponge between her fingers and use it to dilate the cervix, and cut it with her nail until the moisture runs out of it; and press on the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage mixed with sesame oil.
Then command her after the enema to be pressed on [the belly], and make her sneeze with pepper, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour. For immediately the fetus will come out.
If two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you reduce them back with ease little by little. If it does not obey at the entrance, then place the woman on a stool and lift her feet up; then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not come out and the fetus dies, then cut them off, and extract the rest of the fetus; and bind the hand with cloth, and extract it gradually; for it will come out.
The exit of the embryo over its feet. When the fetus comes out over its feet, then it is necessary that you push them up; then gradually turn the fetus; and afterward equalize it.
Then take one of its legs and gradually straighten it.
When they come out as far as the hips, then command her to be pressed on [the belly], and make her sneeze with pepper; for it will come out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out with what we have described, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place it in its natural form. For then it will come out with an easy exit. ›
If it is prevented by what we have narrated: then take mucilage of althea, oil of sesame, and dissolved gum, and pound all together in a mortar with good pounding; then apply it to the woman's wound and her lower abdomen. Then make her sit in warm water until she reaches orgasm.
When you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her a pessary of myrrh and insert it. When the pessary has been in place for one hour, then make her sit on a stool. Then make her sneeze, and pinch her mouth and nose, and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle pressure. For the fetus will immediately come out.
The exit of the fetus is between the knees and hands. When it exits in this manner, then she should insert her hands little by little. ¶ Vt accipiat ipsum. Then let the woman lie on her back and have her feet hang down; she should be lying on a bed, and wrap her hands together. Then press gently above her abdomen. Then remove what is under her feet from the cushions until she is ready below. If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them vigorously. ¶ Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim cum puluinare. Then press gently above the hypogastrium until the fetus rises to the top. Then she should insert her hands and slowly draw out the fetus; and instruct the woman to press down until the fetus comes out.
The exit of the fetus, hanging sideways from the hands. She should insert her hand for the delivery. ¶ Et scias quod sic fit in multis. If however he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
But if she cannot walk, then place her on a bed, and shake her legs strongly.
Then apply the poultice that you have prepared from mucilage.
But if she receives labor pains, then make her sit on a seat. Then proceed to reduce the hand and align the fetus according to its natural shape; make the woman sneeze and command her to bear down until it comes out.
¶ The fetus exits over its neck, hands extended, and the face is towards the mother's back. The midwife should take hold of the fetus's hand, then gradually roll it over and align it with ease.
When it is aligned, then place on its nose that which we have mentioned from oil and mucilage.
Then command her to move little by little. When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat and command her to lean to the right side. Then command her to bear down; and make her sneeze with you.
¶ The fetus comes out prepared on the side. When it descends to the uterine mouth in this manner with the amniotic sac, then cut the amnion with your nail until it is emptied of fluid.
If it hangs over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut from the navel so that it is not retained and does not die.
Then push the fetus inside until you position it as needed; and command the woman to bear down several times, for it will exit easily. ///  The end of the text.
¶ The Birth of Twins or Many Fetuses. You should know that twins are often born, and sometimes three, and four are born. Yet this is unusual and rarely happens.
But five is a thing outside of nature and they do not live at all; and the secondine holds them, although they multiply, by one; and they are separated by a siyafik, distinguishing between them a knot in the navel of each of them.
And sometimes they come out as one fetus comes out naturally and easily; and they come out through a praiseworthy exit, as we have narrated.
If some of them are difficult at birth and reach the unnatural figure which we have mentioned, then take care of them as we have narrated; and let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and contrive according to every figure with that which is prepared for her by an ingenious mind leading to health.
¶ A remembrance of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten; and indeed I have verified that a woman who aborted gave birth to seven, and another fifteen, all of them formed.
Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore, all this ought to be in the knowledge of the obstetrician. For perhaps he will come upon something similar; therefore let him oppose it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
¶ On the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you are treating a dead fetus with what I said about division through medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with the hand, then it is necessary for you to consider [the following].
If the woman is of sound health and has none of the accidents that might cause her loss, then she must be placed on the bed on her back with her head tilted downwards and her legs raised; and a midwife should hold her by both parts or tie her to the bed so that her body is not drawn out during the extraction of the child.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with wet oils made from mucilage of hollyhock, fenugreek, and flax seed.
Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should insert it into the womb gently. Then she should search for the place where she can insert the hooks into the child and suitable places for this.
Therefore consider if the child is ready to descend head first; then insert the hooks into its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under its chin, or on its chest, or near the ribs and under the armpits.
If the descent is by the feet, then in the pubic bone and mid-ribs.
And it is necessary that she should hold the hook with her right hand and place its curve between the fingers of her left hand; then she should insert it gently with her hand until she reaches a vacant spot.
Then she should insert another hook or a third if needed opposite the first, so that there is an equal pull and it does not deviate to one side.
Then it should be pulled with equal extension, and not just straight; rather it should be moved in all directions to ease its passage, as is done with a tooth when pulling it.
And between that, it is necessary that the extension be softened. If part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them to turn out what is retained.
Therefore, if part of the fetus emerges, then change the hooks to another place that is higher: do this until the whole fetus emerges.
Therefore, if a hand comes out before the others and it is not possible to reduce it because of its swelling, then a cloth must be wrapped around it. Then draw it out until the whole thing comes out; cut it either at the joint of the foot or at the elbow: and so you must do with the other hand and both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or there is swelling at its exit, or there is water collected on its head; then the midwife must insert between the fingers a narrow spatula with spines and smooth out the head with it and extract the water; or break it with an instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
Similarly, she should do the same if the fetus is naturally of large head; then it is necessary that she cut the membranes or extract it with a misdach, as we have said. ➤ Then draw out the bones with forceps.
But if the head emerges and is constricted at the chest; then it should be smoothed until the fluid that is in the chest comes out.
But if it does not pass and does not obey its exit; then cut off the head piece by piece as is possible for you.
But if there is a swelling below the belly or it has dropsy; then you must pierce it until the fluid runs out from it.
But if the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy and its direction towards the mouth of the womb is light. ➤ ➤ ➤
If, however, it is constricted around the belly or chest: then you must extract it with the cloth that you have wrapped over your hand; and puncture the belly or chest until the contents run out.
If, however, the other limbs are cut off and the head returns, then let the midwife insert her left hand. Therefore, if the mouth of the womb is open, let her insert her hand deep into the womb and search for the head with it; then draw it up with her fingers to the mouth of the womb; then introduce a hook or two hooks into it, and draw it out with them.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted because of a hot tumor that has occurred there: then it should not be labored upon, but rather a pessary of moist and fatty substances should be administered; and apply poultices; and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
But if the fetus is on its side, then it may turn; then administer what we have said for a live fetus.
But if that is not possible, then cut piece by piece and extract it.
And you must not leave any part of the afterbirth inside at all.
Therefore, when you have completed your work, then administer what we have said for hot tumors that occur in the womb.
But if there is a flow of blood, then let her sit in waters that check bleeding, and administer the rest of the treatment.
And indeed I have seen a woman whose womb had been pregnant with a dead fetus; then she became pregnant again in its place, and afterwards another fetus also died. And so after a long time an abscess occurred at her navel, and it swelled until it opened up: and it began to discharge pus.
I was called upon to treat him, and treated him for a long time; yet the wound did not heal.
Therefore, I placed over him certain plasters of strong drawing power, and an abscess came out from the place. Then some days passed, and another abscess came out. Therefore I marveled at this, since there is no abscess in the belly.
I thought therefore that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
I therefore examined the wound and extracted many bones, while the woman was in a good state; and she has since lived for a long time, although she still discharges a little pus from the place.
And I would not have made mention of this strange occurrence, except that there is knowledge and assistance in it for what the physician-surgeon administers with his hand during treatment.
Chapter 77.
¶ Concerning the forms of necessary instruments in extracting a fetus.
The shape of vertigo which opens the womb.
Here is the form of the forceps, by which books are made equal, having two handles at the ends of two pieces of wood equally. However, this handle ought to be thinner than the forceps, and to make it, take either from ebony or boxwood.
And the width of all the wood is like two fingers; and the edge of each of both is like one finger, and the length of each is a palm and half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood there are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have been firmly fixed on both sides, whose length is more than half a palm. And the width of each is like two fingers or somewhat more.
And these two additions are inserted into the opening of the womb, so that it may be opened with them when you turn the two handles.
Another form similar to it, more subtle and lighter.
It should be made of ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps. Nevertheless, at its end should be two attachments, as you see here above: and the length of each attachment is like a palm, and the width of both is two fingers.
When you wish to open the womb with it, then have the woman sit on the bed, with her feet hanging, and what is between her legs open. Then insert these two connected attachments into the womb, and you hold the end of the instrument below her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount you wish for the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
The shape of another kind of vertigo which the ancients called the pressing shape, by which the fetus is pressed out.  />
The shape of Almisdac, by which the large head is crushed, and it resembles a forceps whose teeth are at its end, as you see.
And sometimes it is made elongated, like a forceps according to this shape, as you see, with teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it cuts and crushes.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />
The form of a hook with one spine.
The form of a hook with two spines.
The form of a spatula with two ends for cutting off the head.
The form of two wide spatulas.
These instruments are all used, and the more their types are increased and prepared by the craftsman, the faster they are for their use, and higher in status among people due to their quantity.
Therefore, do not despise any of these instruments without having them prepared by you. For their necessity is inexcusable.
Chapter 78.
On the Extraction of the Fetus.
When the fetus is retained at birth, then you should advise the patient to hold her breath. Then make her sneeze with you counting: and place your hand over her mouth and nose. If it exits this way, that is good.
If not: then take a pot and make a hole in its lid. And put into it herbs that open the womb, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, sesame, cinnamon, and centaury. Take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them in water, and place them over fire. 》
Then place a reed over the hole of the pot’s lid, and its other end into the womb’s mouth. And let it stay until the vapor reaches the depth of the womb.
Then make her sneeze as I said before. The fetus will come out easily.
If after this treatment it remains and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil or thickened juice of fenugreek. 》 ︎ 》 Then she should insert into the vagina and seek the fetus with it. When she finds it, then she should take it and gradually extend it.
But if it is lodged deep in the womb, then she should insert her hand as we have described until she finds the fetus and gradually draws it out straight, so that the womb does not collapse from a strong pull. Rather, it should be turned gently to the right and left; then add to its size according to the degree of contraction. 》 ︎ 》 ︎ 》 ︎ 》 ︎ The wound then becomes supple, is preserved, and escapes from adhesions.
If the uterine mouth is constricted, as we have already said: treat it with sneezing and the potion of the olla herb.
But if it does not come out with all that we have said, then beware lest you tire yourself in the process of extraction.
Indeed, it is necessary that whatever comes out to the mouth of the womb from her, you should tie it to the woman's thigh. Then enema her with tetrapharmacon ointment. For this will cause it to putrefy after a few days and dissolve, and then come out.
But when it putrefies, a bad smell will rise to the head and stomach of the sick woman and harm her. › Therefore, it is necessary that suitable fumigations be administered for this.
Some of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of watercress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated in cases of retained afterbirth and menses.
Let it be made from a clay pot similar to alcama or from wax: and let its wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed on coals: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another one.
Chapter 79.
¶ On the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Many boys are born with unperforated anuses, whose passages have already been blocked by fine membranes. › › › Therefore, the midwife should pierce that membrane with her finger; and if she cannot, let her pierce it with a sharp needle, and beware of the testicle, lest she touch it.
Then place on it wool soaked in wine and oil. Then care for him with ointments until he is cured.
But if you fear that it may close up again, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and it should be removed when the boy wants to pass water.
It can also happen that the anus closes again due to the healing of a wound or the formation of a swelling. Therefore, that healing must be cut out, and then it should be treated with what we have said regarding the treatment and lead.
Chapter 80
§ On the Treatment of Fistulas That Occur in the Lower Part
The fistulas that occur in the lower part are called nodes and swellings that happen near the anus on the outside or within the space of a finger's width, and there is either one fistula or several.
When that node is opened, it opens up, and from it flows a watery white fluid or thin pus.
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating. Therefore, the penetrating ones are recognized by what comes out during defecation and flatulence when the patient uses defecation; and perhaps a worm comes out of them.
And there are fistulas among them when they penetrate through the space to the bladder and to the opening of the penis. And there are some that penetrate as far as the hip joint and to the base of the tail.
But how to distinguish a fistula that penetrates as far as the anus from one that does not penetrate is that you should insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe made of iron or copper into the fistula, when it is not twisted.
But if there is twisting in it, then insert into it a thin probe made of lead or a horse hair until you feel the probe or hair in your finger.  /> And know that when there is no connection between the fistula and the anus, it is not penetrating.  /> And if it has penetrated as far as the bladder, then the opening will be close to the penis.  /> And if it has penetrated into the space of the hip joint, then you will find a small nodule in the area of the hip joint.
What if you do not feel it at all, and nothing comes out of the hole from discharge, nor is there wind or worms as I said; then know that it is not penetrating; so hurry to the cure.
And when the fistula extends to the bladder or to the passage of urine, then its indication is that urine comes out from it, and the prevention of this so that the place may be healed with medicines.
But if it extends to the hip joint or to the head of the thigh, then its sign is that a probe reaches there, unless there is tortuosity in it up to the head; and the discovery of pain around the part, and that pus always comes out from it; and that no treatment helps, nor does it heal with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their cure is a useless endeavor for those foolish doctors on whom they are formed.
But in that which is not penetrating and is not old, healing is hoped for with a saw; according to what I relate to you, and I have already proven it: and it is, as the patient lies between your hands on his back; and lift up his legs above his thighs, and let his thighs be inclined towards his belly. Then introduce a probe of lead or iron into the fistula, if there is tortuosity in it, until you know where the probe reaches.
But if the patient feels it around the anus, then your index finger should be introduced into the anus.
So if you feel the probe already penetrate through itself, apart from what you sense between your finger and the fistula or flesh; then know certainly that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor over it, because there is no healing for it, as we have said.
They said, however, that in certain people the flesh heals, and from the medication by which help is expected, it is as follows: you should make the cautery subtle according to the width of the fistula, as was said before, and insert the burning cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus. Then repeat that two or three times, until you know that all those added flesh parts, which are similar to the quill of a feather, have already been burnt.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter until those burnt flesh parts come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and strengthen.
If it heals, that is good.
And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
And if the cord exits and does not reach your finger that is in the anus, and there is a thick veil of flesh or silk between it and the cord, and you see the fistula on its surface following the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula along with the cord in the fistula until the cutting reaches where the end of the cord reaches, and the cord is freed and falls out.
Then cleanse those thin flesh parts, which are similar to the quill of a feather, so that nothing remains of them.
But if blood overpowers you and dissolves between you and your work so that you cut those flesh parts, then it is better for what happens, and quicker healing, to cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Because the cautery with fire brings about good results: it burns those added flesh parts, stops the flow of blood, and dries out the moisture.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter or ground cabbage leaves until the place exudes pus and those burnt flesh parts exit with the pus.
Then care for the wound with healing ointments that produce hard flesh: and there are medicines which have astringency and drying properties.
For when they are restored, then they are healed; and do not fear repetition.
But if the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus and is distant from the body's superfluity; then insert your finger into the anus and search with it.
Therefore, if you feel a tentacle and there is a veil of cicatrix or flesh between you and it, and it is close to penetration; then there is no operation on that, except according to the way of trust and hope.
Which is to say that in it one of three methods is administered: either you cauterize the fistula itself, as we have said; or you cut it until you reach its cavity, so that it may be possible for you to introduce a thread and perform the cure immediately afterwards. And do not proceed too much with cutting, lest you cut the ligament that holds the anus and cause a worse outcome of excretion unintentionally.  /> Then care for it with what we have said.
For perhaps it will heal; or you may remove the veil itself and cleanse it after cutting it almost up to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or with another instrument of sharp point. Then cleanse those fleshy parts that are in the cut, as far as you can reach with probing.
Then strive to restore the entire wound with the cut and the upper opening where it is healed; and let the fistula remain open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter on the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is treated in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus near the body's surface with skin and the edge of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like the needle aleskef, that is, prepared from leather, in this manner.  />  />  /> And introduce a thread wrapped with five threads into it, and around it. Then insert the probe along with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its hollow part.
If it is penetrating into the margin of the anus on the inside near to it, then pull the thread out through that opening, so that you introduce your finger into the anus and pull out the end of the thread, and join both ends together; tie each one firmly, and leave it for one day or two days. And the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tie it tightly until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is cut off and falls away; then care for the wound until it heals and closes.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate by whatever method you prepare for yourself, unless it is very deep. For it is not your task to do this because of the fleshy part, so that you do not cut into it.
Then treat it as we have said until it heals.
The shape of the spatula with sharp points for opening a fistula, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is unnecessary, as you see. ›
Chapter 81
About the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows after their incision, and the care for fissures.
There are two types of hemorrhoids. For they are either inside the anus, like blisters of coal, or like grapes. › › And from them are small and large ones; and blood always flows from them, sometimes one, sometimes many. And they are outside the anus and at its ends.
However, those which are outside the anus are for the most part very small, from which flows yellowish water or a little blood with persistent flow; and they are of the same color as the body. › › › › ›
And its treatment that is within the anus is to instruct the sick person to sit and be expressed until the anus emerges and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Therefore, suspend them with hooks or hold them with your nail. Then cut them at their roots.
But if hooks do not hold in them because of their moisture and softness, then take them with a rough cloth or with a linen pad made from double-layered wool, and extract them with your fingers. Then cut them, and after cutting sprinkle on them some warm powders to act as a caustic. Or cauterize them according to what has been mentioned in the chapter on cauterization. Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
If the anus does not obey its exit, then administer an enema to the sick person, in which there is a small amount of bitter substance, so that it cleanses what is in the anus and obeys quickly when the sick person expels himself.
If the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their case is light and easy; it is to take them with your nail or take them with a hook and cut them. Then treat them as we said until they heal.
And he who is repulsed by the cutting with iron, then it is necessary for you to apply a bandage to them in this manner. Take a thread wrapped around, and insert it into a needle. Then draw out the hemorrhoids upwards, and make the needle penetrate its root from the other side; and wind the two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle, so that they are parallel; and bind the hemorrhoid tightly with a strong knot. Then tie off the thread, and withdraw the needle.  />  Et adhaerebit adhelil in loco suo, et non egredietur de loco suo: sed manebit in eo usque dum evanescat.
This with all athelics, and let one of them go; do not let it sew itself, so that the superfluity of blood may flow from it.
Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or black oil over the anus and tell the patient to rest. Then leave it until it falls off.
When the athelils fall off, care for them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they heal.
¶ On the Treatment of Fissures. For often fissures occur due to the drying out of feces and the constriction of nature.
Therefore, when they become old and medicine does not work on them, then you must scrape them with the point of a Spatula or with your nail until they become moist, and remove the upper skin that prevents them from healing. Then treat them until they heal as necessary.
But if they do not heal, then scrape them more strongly than before until they bleed profusely, and then treat them until they heal. ›
¶ On the Treatment of Inverted Hemorrhoids, and Non-Inverted; and Dry Athelics, and Threadworms.
Chapter 82
Know that a hemorrhoid is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail, and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers, and walking causes pain from them.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut the part around the nail and hold it with forceps or a hook, and pull it out from its root.
Then treat it, and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said in its own chapter.
From dry athelics, one is a small, rough, thread-like, round prominence on the surface of the body. And often they happen in children's hands.
And its cure is to stretch the skin and cut it, or tie it with a silk thread or hair until it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it as described before with fire or sharp medicine; and thus the skin will be removed, both inverted and uninverted, using the tool that I shall describe.
Also, a wart is a small, dense, protruding growth on the surface of the body, deeply rooted; and when cold touches it, there is a sensation like that of an ant bite, and this occurs throughout the body; and it most often occurs in the hands.
And its cure is to take a small tube made of goose feather or strong vulture feather and place it over the wart until the circle of the tube encloses its edges. Then turn your hand with the tube until it cuts off what is around the wart, and you will place it deeply into the flesh, and thus you will remove the wart from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a tube of bronze or iron, following this shape.
Let the top of the tube be rounded to allow easy gripping and turning.
And if you wish, cauterize the wart as described before for the cauterization of skin in the chapter on cautery.
Chapter 83
¶ On the shapes of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus and for relieving flatulence and colic.
Sometimes the enema is made of silver, or brass, or cast bronze, or hammered bronze.
And sometimes it is made from these instruments, both small and large, according to those who administer them.
That which is administered for the treatment of small children should be small; and whose anuses are weak or painful, thus also their enemas.
Large enema.
The cannula should have its upper end, where the bladder is tied, wide according to this manner: and it should have a distinct narrowing so that the bladder can be tied as you see, and its lower tip which is inserted into the anus should be closed, i.e., not open, very smooth, drawing towards subtlety; and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the reeds, and slightly thicker; and let the bladder in which the medicines are placed be from the bladder of an animal or from sheepskin, which should be according to the shape of a small asofrat, whose root is one palm.
And it should be perforated with many holes as described, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger. Then insert into those holes a thread made from raw silk, which should be made of ten threads or thereabouts, and tie the bladder to it like an asofrat. Therefore, when the bladder is placed inside, let the enema be tied at its neck with a strong knot between the two narrowings.  /> Then administer the enema with it.
And this is the shape of the bladder's circle as depicted here, and its holes.
The method of administering the enema with it is as follows: fill the bladder or bag with medicine that has been warmed according to the patient's tolerance, and be careful not to make it very hot or very cold.  />  />  />
Then the patient should lie on their back and lift their legs up; and place under them a carpet or cloth on which people sit or lie.
Then anoint the tip of the enema with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances. Then introduce it into the anus easily. Then let the assistant take the bladder with both hands at once and squeeze it forcefully until all that is in the enema has been expelled into the intestine.
Then remove the enema and let the patient raise their legs against the wall.
If the medicine urges him to defecate, then he should hold on as much as possible. And if he sleeps with it all night, it is better for his recovery.
But if you enema him during bouts of diarrhea and his evacuation is swift: then repeat the enema until he is cured.  />
But if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the enema be very fine and gentle, like those used to enema children.
And this is the form of a fine enema onto which a thin skin is stretched.  />
Chapter 84.
Now, I have already spoken in the division on wound treatment according to what was suitable for this book, and here I will speak of their treatment with the hand and with medicines according to the completion.
Therefore, I say that wounds are distinguished according to what causes the wound and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Therefore, the things by which wounds are made are often like a thrown stone; or the cut of a sword, or a knife; or a blow with a spear, or wood, or an arrow; and similar things from many other objects.  />
Wounds that are made according to the places of the body are as follows: a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver; and similar things from those members.
And I am describing the treatment of certain wounds, so that I may apply this reasoning and rule to other wounds as well.
And I shall begin with simple head wounds, since the description of compounded wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say: When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no bone fracture, consider whether it was caused by a thrown stone or something similar, which has only pierced the skin, resulting in a large wound. If you fear that an inflammation with hot aposteme may occur, hasten to perform an immediate phlebotomy of the cephalic vein. Do not delay this; extract from it blood according to its strength, especially if the blood coming out of the wound is scanty. And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part. And let the patient beware of becoming full, wine, and heavy foods.
If something prevents bleeding, then let it be induced by food restriction, and do not approach meats or wine.
And place on the wound, if an inflammation with hot aposteme occurs, cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with wine that has an astringent effect.
But if you are secure from hot aposteme, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and the air has not yet changed it, the powder that I will describe shortly; but if the air has already changed it, then apply to it some ointments until it heals.
But if the wound is large, or from a sword cut and similar things, and its lips do not come together by themselves, then join them with stitches, as I will describe in the chapter on abdominal wounds about their stitching.
If however the wound has already been separated from the bone and hangs down, and there is no support for it except a small tendon, then cut it. Then treat the wound with medicines and restore flesh in its place like skin. And instruct the patient to be nourished with foods that are thick, such as heads (of animals) and boiled wheat until it is like porridge; and similar foods.
If you find decay in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut off all of the decayed part and throw it away; then treat (the wound).
But if in these wounds there is an artery or a vein from which blood flows, and it is not stopped by medicines, then look for a way to stop the bleeding. If you find it (the vessel) uncut, then cut it with a scalpel or tie it off. If necessity requires it when the previous method is not effective, then cauterize (the vessel) until the bleeding stops.
But if these wounds are small and simple, then their treatment is easy and light; so that you should sprinkle this powder over them, because it heals them before the air changes them.
The Method of Powder for Fleshing Out (Wounds). Take one part of frankincense and two parts of dragon's blood and three parts of unslaked lime; grind all together very finely, and sift it. And fill the wound with it, and bind it well with a good bandage until it adheres to it well and clots with the blood. 》
Then bind (the wound) on top with lint and leave it, without loosening it until it has healed enough not to be opened again. For the medicine should not be removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes lime alone accomplishes this, when you do not have frankincense or dragon's blood at hand; and dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is placed on them and they are bandaged, and the wounds are fresh with their own blood, which has not been altered by the air. 》 》 》 》
If, however, the air has altered it by some alteration, especially in summer, then the intention is not to use this powder. Care for it with what we have said, placing on it certain digestive ointments; or place on it pastes made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until pus is emitted. Then care for the rest of the treatment until they heal.
But if a fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with tweezers; and I will now say the treatment for fractures of the skull as follows.
Concerning wounds of the neck.
If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple wound of the head.
If, however, the nerve of the neck or artery has been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no treatment for it except to avoid treating it with what causes strong astringency, such as alum and colocynth, and similar things. Because they harm nerves and contract them.
And do not place anything cold at all on the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and their continuity is with the brain, which is the highest of the members: and let that by which it is treated be from medicines that are gentle, such as calx washed with sweet water, repeatedly infused with oil or rose oil and tuthia, when also washed with sweet water; and other mineral stones according to this method, and moist ointments.
If, however, the wound is large, then apply a suture: or bind its lips with bandages. Then care for it until it heals.
But if the wound has depth, or a cavity occurs at its lower part, where pus already collects, then pierce it in a more depressed place therein.
If the artery has already been cut in the wound and blood flow is occurring, then separate or cut it and tie it off; or cauterize it if necessity requires that.
If the cartilage of the throat has been cut, or all of it, and the alhaudegi have been saved: then join the lips of the skin with stitches on top of the throat canal, and do not touch the throat, but equalize it, and reduce it to its natural shape. Then tie it tightly in a decent manner, and leave it for several days. Then care for it with ointments that have astringency and drying properties, until it heals.
If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then explore it: if there are bone fragments in it, extract all of them, or as many as you can; and what cannot be prepared, leave it until the wound becomes foul, and its opening is separated and relieved.
But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder that I have mentioned. But if bone is seen in the wound and a fistula forms: then treat it with what was mentioned in its appropriate chapter.
About a wound on the ribs.
If it is a blow from a spear or knife: and you see its depth, then consider [it]. If therefore from the wound there comes out a hissing sound when the patient pants, then know that the wound is fatal.
But if the wound is not deep and it is fresh with its blood: then do not apply powder on it from the first hour, nor tie it up, so that the blood does not become trapped in its depth and return to the heart and kill the patient; but apply an attracting ointment on it, and loosen it twice a day.
If indeed the ointment is not available to you, then place an old cloth over the wound's opening so that it absorbs what comes out of it from moistures: and arrange for the patient to sleep on the wound, so that what accumulates within it may drain away.
If indeed three days or more have passed for the wound and no spasm has occurred to the patient, nor any bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see that its other conditions are good; then know that the wound is safe. Care for him with bandages and the rest of the treatment until he heals.
If indeed its healing is delayed and it remains open, then know that a fistula has already formed. Care for it according to the chapter on fistulas.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut and is simple on the surface of the chest or back; then care for it with what preceded about stitching if it is large; or with dust if it is small.
But if it has already made an impression on the bone and fragments have come out of it; then explore the wound and hasten to extract those fragments if they are separate. But if they are not separate, then leave them until the wound becomes foul, for their extraction will be easier.
For other wounds occurring in other members, the judgment in treatment is the same as we have said.
¶ On wounds of the belly and the protrusion of the bowels, and their protrusions. ¶
A disruption that occurs in the belly is either large, medium, or small. ¶ ‌
From a large disruption, sometimes the bowel or several bowels come out.
Therefore their reinsertion and stitching is more vigorous and difficult.
And even a small rupture is difficult in another way. Therefore, their reduction will be more difficult if you do not hurry to insert them into their place immediately; because it swells up, opens, and thickens, making its entrance difficult.
Therefore, the medium rupture is better than others; because with it, there is no difficulty in reducing the intestine, as happens with these two kinds.
Know that the suture of a vein is according to four methods.
Two common sutures are suitable for the suture of the abdomen and for the suture of other wounds of the body, and two other sutures are specifically used for other wounds. However, they are more particularly associated with the suture of the abdomen; and I will describe each one to you with its explanation and demonstration.
I say therefore that when the wound is small and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is due to one of two causes. Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we have said; or because there is distension in the intestine due to cold air.
Therefore, when this is the case, you should heat it so that you dip a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water alone. Or boil in water aniseed, cumin, and pepper; crush them together with it until the distension is relieved.
Sometimes this [reduces the inflammation] with wine that has astringent properties, and it is better than water alone for relieving distension.
Therefore, when you see that the distension has been relieved, then wet the intestine with water in which mallow or marshmallow has been boiled. Because through this its entrance with a small instrument is facilitated.
If its return is prevented after this treatment, then find a small fissure with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids.
The first cure is better when it is prepared than when it is cut; and there is no need to cut after the necessity and failure of the instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp; and let its tip not be too fine, but rather a bit blunter. And it should resemble a gimlet, as you see.
When the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its own natural shape in its proper place, if possible over it; because this is better.
But when the fissure is large in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back and raise his legs higher than his head. And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly, if there is a fissure in one of the two parts of the belly, then direct your attention and thought always to this: that the part with the wound be higher than the other part.
And thus it is necessary that you use it for large wounds and medium-sized wounds.  />  In addition to these things that I have mentioned above, it is also necessary to add certain things and preparations for this procedure.
But in small wounds, place it according to how you prepare it.
Then make sure there is a devout assistant present with you, who holds the entire fissure in his hand: and bring its lips together. Then have the one following remove something after something from it for stitching; and this is the method of common single-stitch suturing.
And it is as if you take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound. Then leave from the end of the disruption a quantity equal to the width of the ring finger, that is, the physician's little finger; and insert one needle beyond that, with which you will introduce into it a thread at both ends of the skin, along with two ends of sifac which is under the skin from within, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and then you have already joined together two ends of the skin and two ends of sifac; and they become four layers.
Then tie the thread double around the needle several times from both sides together until the two lips of the wound are joined by an acceptable approximation.
Then also leave the thickness of a finger and insert another needle; afterward, draw it with thread, as you did with the first needle. Therefore, do not cease to do this with those needles until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
And the needles should be of medium thickness, neither too thin nor too thick; because thin needles cut the flesh very quickly, and thick ones are difficult to enter into the skin; therefore, it is necessary that they be of medium thickness between thinness and thickness.
And it is not appropriate that the needle be inserted at two points on the skin that are very close to each other, so that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound is not opened before its own healing, and also so that they do not become too long with suturing, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient in their sleep; and place little woolen balls around them from all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound has already healed.
And this type of stitch with needles is more suitable for small wounds. Because one needle, or two, or about that number is sufficient for their stitching.
The second suture is common, so you can bring together with one suture the ends of four things: two ends of skin and two ends of flesh, as if they were one, using an equal needle with thread wound around it in fineness and thickness.
Then, when you have penetrated these four ends with the needle, bring the needle back from where you started, so that the thread falls on the superior part of the wound: so that it is a suture like the suture of cloths by which clothes are sewn together. And put between every suture a quantity equal to the thickness of a little finger.
This suture is known by people.
And with this suture I healed a wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the separation of the wound was more than one palm: and about two palms came out from the middle of the intestine, and the separation was in the middle of the belly.
I returned it therefore after his intestine stood outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
The wound was healed after about fifteen days: and I cured him, and he was saved: and he lived after that for many years, restored to his usual condition.
And the physicians had judged that he would not be cured.
And it was a miracle that I did not cure it with ointment. Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor any other medicine. So I put an old cloth over the wound twice a day, and I kept washing it with honey water until it was healed.
But I will mention two specific kinds of suture according to the account.
And it is as follows: begin with a sharp suture, and insert the needle from the outside towards the inside part.  ()
When the needle pierces the skin and travels along the length and width of the entire body: let the end fall on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate from one end to the other, from the inside out at the opposite end.
So when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in this manner in the same end from the outside to the inside: and let the other end fall away, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the opposite end from the inside out: and with your penetration by which you make it penetrate into the end of the thread, which is in its part, until it penetrates entirely.
Then also begin from this same side, either the thread alone or with its end that is from the thread on the other side, and extract the needle from the skin which it has penetrated.
Then return it to that skin with either the end of the thread which is on the other side along with this end of the thread; and extract it from the skin which is on that side; and do this once and another, and do this alternately, until you have entirely removed all outward according to that example.
And the sum of this stitching is that as you sew the hides which are skins; so you should have thread one time from one side of the skin: and leave it another time from the other side, until you complete it.
The second kind of stitching which is called Galenus.
This is his explanation as to how it should be done similarly, as some healers do, so that they gather all the parts to their corresponding fit by nature: and they apply the end of the thread to its other end, and the end of the thread to its other end. And that happens as I tell you.
You should insert the needle at the end of the eye nearest to you on the outside and make it penetrate only to the inside; and leave two ends loose. Then turn the needle around and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside at the two loose ends, that is, on both sides.
Then turn both around and make them penetrate from the inside out to the two ends of the other eye, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of stitching is better than the common easy stitch, and it is the stitch whose mention preceded.
This then is also the teaching of Galen.
And some said. The stitching of the belly is done with two needles. That is, you introduce one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle from what is on your side, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the stitching of those who sew skins equally. '>
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly: then its stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
The judgment concerning the treatment of a wound is the same as with other wounds.
That is to say, if you obtain a fresh wound with its own blood before the air changes it; and you return the intestines and sew them back in place, and stitch them up: then put powdered flesh-eating powder on top.
But if the air has already changed the wound, then put some ointments on top of it which are present to you, until they make pus: and the stitches fall out, and the suture and eyelet heal. Then care for it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it heals.
If the medications are not available to you, then immediately place on it an old cloth, from whence it begins to emit pus; and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
For you do not need other medications in many situations when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will infect the main limbs, then it is necessary that you soak a soft cloth in oil of moderate warmth or rose oil; and place it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
But if he feels pain or punctures or decay in his intestines (for this often happens), then give him an enema with black, warm wine of the stiptic kind; especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and has become penetrating up to its cavity.
And know that what comes from the large intestine is of easier healing; and what comes from the small intestine is of more difficult healing.
But the intestine that is called the jejunum does not receive healing at all from a wound that occurs in it; and this is because of the multitude of its veins and their great size, and because of the subtlety of its body and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
But if what proceeds from the wound is an ulcer and you get it freshly: bring it back according to your method of bringing back the intestines equally.
But if the time has passed and it has become green or black; then you should bind it with a thread over the place that has turned black from it, so that bleeding does not occur. For an ulcer contains veins and arteries.
Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside: so that its attraction towards you is relieved, and its extraction in case of a zirb, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Remembering an injury to the intestine.
When a disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible to restore it in some people; for this reason, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old, and a fistula formed, and discharge and flatulence came out from it.
Therefore, I applied treatment until I was not confident about his healing; nor did I cease to probe him until he was healed, and the place became solid.
After I saw the place already solidified, I feared for the patient that something bad might happen to his belly; and nothing bad happened to him from this. ¶ And he remained in his best condition, eating and drinking, and having sex, and entering the bath, and exercising according to his diet.
And now some experimentalists say that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied up in this way. And it is as if you take ants with big heads. Then gather the two lips of the wound together and place one of those ants that has its mouth open onto the two lips of the wound. Therefore when it bites on them and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it sticks and does not come undone.
Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with ants one after another according to the size of the entire wound.
Then return it and its wound. Those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is fed and healed, so that no further harm comes to the patient.
And now it is possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread: after removing it from the animal's intestine, it is attached together with it when inserted into the needle.
And it is necessary to take the end of this thread from the intestine and remove much of the meat from it. Then tie a fine linen thread around its end, wrapped around it. Then insert that thread into the needle, along with the intestine. Then return it to the opening.
And this method of stitching with ants and intestine is only according to the path of trust and hope.
Know that if the wound is large and especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no cure for it except to trim it down, and its healing is not possible at all.
¶ On the care of hernias and fistulas.
Know that any wound or abscess, when it becomes old and chronic, turns into an ulcer and does not heal, and always discharges pus and does not drain: then it is universally called a fistula in whatever limb it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
And indeed a fistula is truly a hardened, white, perforated knot: it does not cause pain, and has the shape of a bird's feather. And because of this, some call it Risati, which means "feather.
And there are certain hours in which it becomes moist and discharges pus. And perhaps the moisture splits at certain times. 》 And sometimes this moisture is great and is little; and it is thick, and it is subtle.
And I have already stated in the division, then when I said "wounds," that every wound which does not heal and flesh is not born in it, this is only due to one of nine causes.
One of which is either due to the lack of blood in the body or its bad quality; or because between it and its surface there is hard flesh preventing the birth of flesh; or because there is much dirt and filth; or because the wound itself is putrid, and the matter sent to it is of poor quality; or because the medicine used for its treatment is unsuitable; or because the corruption falling in the region is a type of plague, or by the nature of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of diseases is difficult and the healing of apostemes is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone in it, or a number of bones.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division; and it is necessary here for me to make you know the treatment of fistulas and abscesses, which are done by the way of surgery with the hand.
Know therefore that a fistula can occur in all parts of the body. For among them are fistulas which reach great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the bladder; or the intestine, or the bladder, or one of the ribs; or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints composed of bones, as in the hand and foot; and among them are those which go towards the proximity of the principal member and its like.
Therefore, of these fistulas, the one which is in this manner, is difficult to heal from diseases and does not accept treatment, and dealing with it is hard work and ignorance.
If the fistula is such that its depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and you wish to come to know it, then take a probe of iron or copper, if the fistula extends in a straight line, and search for it with it.
If there is a twist in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead. Because lead, due to its softness, is bent around the twist.
If the fistula has multiple openings, it will not be possible for you to indicate on it with a probe. Therefore, irrigate one of its openings from among its openings.
For the liquid with which you irrigate it goes towards the other openings and runs out of them.
Then carefully investigate in whichever way it is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is an opening or a nerve, and the concavity of the fistula is distant or close by; or whether the fistula is one which has many openings, and stand over the whole thing with all your strength, and with your questioning where you question the patient, and the discovery of pain upon pressing with your hand on the place, and similar signs and accidental causes of inflammation. )))
Therefore, when you stand over all these things with true station, then go to the cure according to your confidence, and it is that you consider then, if the fistula is close by and apparent, or in a safe place distant from the joint, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then cut the fistula as has been said in my account, and remove what is in it from the filtration, and decayed flesh, which grows in its opening from flesh or pus, and similar things; and care for it until it heals. )))
If however the fistula is of deep length and straight: then you ought to cut it as deeply as possible for you. Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply linens wrapped in sharp medicines, and insert them into the concavity of the fistula which you have grasped with iron; do this several times until the sharp medicine has corroded all that remains in the concavity of the fistula from corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh, until it heals.
If however it does not heal by this means, then cauterize it as we have described.
Therefore if the cause of the fistula is a bone, and you are certain of it, then search for it, and cut it as I have told you, unless something prevents you from a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we said.
Therefore if the bone is revealed to you and there is something corrupted and blackened upon it, then scrape it until its entire corruption is removed. Then care for it with that which causes it to grow flesh, until it heals.
But if it does not heal and discharges pus as before, then know that you have not reached the complete removal of corruption.
Therefore clean it a second time, and make an exacting search for its root and cleansing with all your strength.
Then restore it. If however it heals, that is good; and if not, then know that the corruption is in a deep part of the body which you have not reached. Therefore you have no skill regarding it except to leave it to nature.
But if the bone is small and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps that are suitable for it.
If, however, there are many bones, then carefully draw all of them out, and do not leave any with your strength.
But if something from the moist parts causes a contrariety and there is no fear or error in their incision, then cut those moist parts and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then place on the wound something that will cause it to putrefy, and leave it until what is around those bones from flesh and moist parts has putrefied.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal over. And let the incision you made in your work be drawn together. Or place on it, if you wish, a cotton cloth soaked in pounded sulfur with oil, or a cotton cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any of the green ointments.
For when those moist parts have putrefied and the bones are separated from them, their removal and drawing out is easier.  />
But if it is a large bone, such as the thigh bone or hip bone, and the like, and what has become corrupt in it is a large part; then scrape it with the finest scraper until that blackness and corruption is removed. Then restore the wound.
But if what has become corrupt in it is a large part and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw through it and cut all the way to where the corruption has reached; then care for it until it heals over.
And I tell you of a case that happened to a man in his leg; so that you might place it as an example and aid upon your work.
There was a young man about thirty years old who had pain in his leg from an internal cause that moved within him, until the matter reached the leg and formed a large abscess; there was no external cause for this.
Therefore, time was extended with that error of the physicians until the abscess burst, and many substances gathered with it. And his treatment was delayed until the leg ulcerated, and many openings formed on it, which all discharged pus and body fluids.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of surgery among them until I was called, and I saw his leg and the substances flowing from those openings in great quantity. Indeed, the man's entire body had already wasted away, and his color was jaundiced.
Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the mouth.
Then I examined all the openings and found that they connected to each other from every part of the leg.
I hurried and cut above one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone, and found it corrupt, already rotten and blackened, and putrefied, to the point that it had been penetrated all the way to the marrow.
I sawed off what was exposed to me and prepared from the rotten bone.
And I concluded that there was no corruption in the bone except what I cut off and sawed away. And I had already rooted it out.
Then I placed a dressing on the wound with healing and strengthening medicines for a long time. ()} And it did not heal.
Then I tried again and exposed above the bone beyond my first exposure; and I found a continuous corruption connected to the bone, and I sawed away what appeared to me from that corruption as well.
Then I attempted to heal it. ()} And it was not healed.
Therefore, I exposed it again and did not stop cutting the bone bit by bit and attempting to heal it until I had cut off about a hand's breadth from the bone along with its marrow.
Then I restored him with medicines, and it quickly healed and was cured; nor would this repetition of the operation and cutting have been necessary for him, except because of his weakened condition and his limited ability to endure, and my fear of death for him; because from the excess of evacuation, he suffered bad fainting spells every hour.
Therefore, he was healed completely; and in place of the bone, firm and good flesh grew, and his body was well-arranged, and his strength returned; and he recovered his usual condition; and the operation did not cause him any harm at all while walking.
But if the bone protrudes in place of a broken body part, then it is necessary to saw it off in this manner: Take a ligature and tie it tightly at the end of the protruding bone; and order someone to pull it upwards; and place another thicker ligature made of wool above the first one. Then tie it tightly over the flesh that is on the bone; and extend its end so as to pull the flesh downwards; and thus you expose the flesh in the place where you want to saw, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Put a piece of wood or board under the bone properly; because when you do this, it does not prevent the saw from cutting through the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary for the sawing to be done briefly over the corrupted place, so that there may not be a corruption in the hollow of the bone; and so that it does not appear to the sense of sight when revealed, but rather compels another part to be sawn instead.
But if the bone is corrupted and does not protrude, but rather remains continuous with another part; and the corruption is in the middle of it or in any part of it; then remove all the flesh from every side. Then place wood below.
Then saw that part where the corruption is, until the sawing reaches the other side; and let the sawing be along the length of the corruption by a little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is at a joint, cut off the corrupted joint and saw the bone where it continues on the other side.
But if the corruption is between two joints, then there is no skill [needed] but to scrape it off.
If the corruption is in the comb of the hand or the comb of the foot, then the situation there is very difficult. Indeed, you should examine how the corruption appears to you. And scrape it off, and clean it in whatever way you can and with whatever skill seems right to you, when a vein or nerve does not hinder you.
And know that there are many types of instruments and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness or thinness, their size or smallness, their hardness or softness. Therefore, it is necessary that you prepare an instrument suitable for every kind of operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the type of instrument you need when your work is extensive. And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a witness to the methods of diseases, for then you will find by yourself what suits each one from among the instruments for every illness.
And I will confirm to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you should place for examples on which you cut, and the trial by which you test others.
Shape of another saw.
The shape of the razor for cutting tendons. Let the head of this razor be in the shape of a star-shaped nail head, and its points be in the shape of the points of the elischetefeg.
And it is not suitable except to scrape with it the heads of tendons when they are damaged or have a large and wide opening.
The shape of the larger razor.
The shape of the wide razor.
The shape of the razor with a concavity.
The shape of another fine razor.
The shape of another curved-tipped razor.
The shape of a small and delicate probe.
This resembles a file and its tip is like a saw; it is used in many places because of the roughness of the bones.
The shape of the razor suitable for scraping that which has been perforated from the bone.
Its tip is triangular, with sharp points.
It comes from India. xspace And similarly, it is necessary that all of the things which we have mentioned be made from razors and chisels and saws.
¶ On cutting off extremities and sawing bones.
Extremities become putrid either from an external cause or from an internal one.
When you have treated that corruption with medicinal treatment and the treatment does not help, and you see the corruption spreading in the extremity where nothing heals it, then you must cut off that limb until the point of corruption, so that the sick person may escape from death or from a greater evil due to the loss of the limb.  />
And the sign of which this occurs is that the member turns black until it seems rotten; that fire has burned it, or that it becomes rotten after turning black; until that rot extends to the next member and spreads throughout the whole body.
Hurry therefore with its incision, and likewise if the cause of the rotting is from the bite of certain venomous creatures, such as a sea scorpion, a viper, a toad, and similar things.
If therefore the rotting or bite is at the tip of a finger, then cut the finger and do not leave space for the rotting to advance up to the rest of the hand.
And likewise if it occurs on the hand, then cut it from the root of the finger, and do not leave space for the rotting until it reaches into the flesh of the arm.
And if it invades there, then cut the arm at the elbow in its joint.
But if the rotting passes through and you see it around the elbow, then death is certain for the patient. And to administer something beyond that from the treatment is a measure of skill.
And do the same for the foot when rotting invades a toe; then cut it at one of the joints. And if it reaches to the sole of the foot, then cut off the whole foot. But if it goes up to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
If rotting has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it except to release and leave the patient to die.
And the method of cutting a member or sawing it is to tie a ligature below where you wish to cut, and tie another ligature above the place. And one assistant should pull the lower ligature downward, and another assistant should pull the upper ligature upward. And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures with a broad spatula until all of the flesh is revealed.  Then it should be cut or cauterized.
And it is necessary that you place a linen cloth from all parts and that the saw does not touch the healthy place: and an additional injury may occur to the patient, as well as a hot abscess.
But if bleeding occurs inside while you are working, then quickly cauterize the place or put on it some powders that absorb blood. Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and take care of it until it heals.
And I tell you that this same thing happened to a man on his foot, just as I am telling you now.
Which means that blackness occurred on his foot with a burn that resembles the burning of fire: and this corruption first appeared on his toe until it began to affect the whole foot.
Therefore, the man hastened to remove it himself after he saw the corruption attacking his limb with great intensity, as he found from the pain and burn: and he cut into himself at the joint, and was cured.
And after a long time had passed, that same corruption occurred on his index finger of his hand.
Therefore he came to me, and I tried to remove that excess with what I placed on his hand from medicines after cleaning his body: but the excess did not go away, and it began to advance into another finger until corruption began in his hand.
So he called on me to cut open his hand: and I did not want to do that, hoping that through my means the excess would be removed: and I also feared that cutting into his hand could cause death. Because the strength of the man was against this situation.
After he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and word came to me about him that he had hastened and cut open his whole hand: and he was cured. 》
And I have not brought forth this account except to serve as an aid regarding that which falls under the category of this disease; and so that there may be a signification by which it is indicated, and according to which action should be taken.
About the care of veins and the quality of enema with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy limbs and the abscess extends to the point of forming a collection of pus: then it bursts or is perforated, and what is inside it, namely pus, comes out; and there remains a space empty as if it were a vessel; and the skin over it is like a thin cloth that has not yet reached the final stage of decay, neither does it press upon an opening, nor upon a nerve, nor upon a ligament: then it deserves to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula. However, if its space extends to the point where corruption presses upon any one of these parts, then it is called a Fistula or zuken.
And its treatment is that you should cut all that skin as if it were rolled back; and especially when it has become thin like a cloth; and trusting that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere and that the final corruption will not follow; and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an enema: and it should be treated as if it were a Sinus.
Then if it is large and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor, then enema it with an Egyptian medicine made of vinegar, oil, and gum acacia, the parts being equal, collected in a vessel; and they are cooked over fire until the medicine becomes red; and it reaches the consistency of honey.
Then take from it what you need, and dissolve it with water and honey, and administer it as an enema to the bladder. Close its opening and leave the medicine inside for two hours.
Then extract it with pressing. Do this for so many days until the bladder is cleansed and the odor removed.
And sometimes it should be administered as an enema with water of ash, when this medicine is not available to you. Take the ash from grapevine wood or ash from holm oak wood and throw it into the water. Then filter it and administer it as an enema until you are confident that the bladder has been cleansed.
If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then administer it as an enema with water and honey to which some ground cinnamon has already been mixed. Or administer it as an enema with mixed honey and wine, because it is the nature of honey to cleanse and wash, and wine makes the bladder adhere, especially when there is a preponderance of dryness in the wine.
When you do this several times and are confident that the bladder's corruption has been removed, then administer it as an enema with something that promotes the growth of flesh within it.
And this is done by taking diaphoretic plaster and dissolving it with rose oil and astringent wine, or by administering it as an enema with certain other medicines and ointments whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
If the opening of the bladder is too narrow for an enema to pass through, then slightly widen it with iron: or place a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment or in basil ointment within it until it widens.
And similarly, if the opening is also large, then sew together its lips with a stitch: and leave from it the amount into which an enema can enter without anything added.
And similarly, if the opening from which the pus runs is raised upwards, then cut into it in a lower place that is within it, so that the pus may run out downwards; for when the pus is constricted in the depth of the Sinus, it prevents the growth of flesh in it.
And if it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus lower down as you wish, then try to prepare the member with a preparation that will cause the pus to run out easily according to how it is prepared for you. Try that nothing at all of the pus is retained in it; and take consolidative medicines which are placed on the mark, suitable for what you wish. And spread them out onto a piece of linen. And let the piece of linen be large enough to cover the entire Sinus. Then cut with scissors a hole directly into the opening of the Sinus, slightly larger than the opening of the Sinus itself. Then spread a soft ointment onto another piece of linen according to the size of the hole; and place it over the opening, positioned far from the Sinus opening, so that the exit of the pus may be relieved; and do not remove the large cloth until after some days, once a day.  />
But the one that is over the opening of the Sinus, that is the one you remove in every hour, so that what collects in it from the pus may go out; and so that you may know if that which runs out of it is much or little, or well digested or undigested.
And with this again consider the place of the Sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is a swelling in it, or there is no swelling in it.
When your treatment is thus extended and you see the material coming out of the sinus opening, then know that the sinus has already attached or is approaching attachment; therefore, in the morning or on the third day, loosen it. And when you open the wound, change to another cloth and renew the ointment.
But if after a long time a fine pus comes out of the sinus, do not despair of its attachment, for its healing is approaching; for there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and others act contrary to this.
But if after many days undigested pus comes out of the sinus, then know that the sinus is not attached.
If the attachment of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then in the treatment of the wound, let the medicines be made so that they are humid in substance but dry in power; such as the ointment dyafinicon, when to it is added an excess of zegi.
And one of the most effective treatments is to take the ointment dyafinicon and dissolve it in rose oil, and sprinkle over it an equal amount of old wine by substance.
Then mix it together and use it.
Similarly, perform this action when you do not have the ointment dyafinicon present; instead use honey, cooked until it thickens, and use that.  /> Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense; grind all of it together, and sprinkle the powder over honey while it is on the fire.  />  />  />  /> Then place it on a cloth and bind it over the sinus; and when you have cooked the honey until it thickens, sprinkle over it spices and place another cloth over it, and bind that.
And sometimes it is administered with long Aristolochia, and the root of heavenly lily, which is a lily; and herb flour, and Centaury. Use them either as simples or in compound form; grind them and sieve the powder. Sprinkle it on the honey I mentioned, and use it.
But if the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it; either it has already made an impression on the bones or on other hard parts of the body or ligaments. Then treat it with the treatment for fistulas as was stated before.
¶ On the care of paronychia and broken nails, and on cutting into a finger and dissection.
Paronychia is an abscess that occurs under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot; and perhaps it may occur on the other fingers as well.
When its duration is prolonged and the care of it neglected, it becomes an abscess with hot pus; or it corrupts and emits pus until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts it all, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone until there is a foul odor. The tip of the finger becomes swollen and its color darkens. ︎
Therefore, when you treat it with what we have said in the section on division, and your treatment does not help, then you must cut off with a knife all the remaining overgrowth from the nail. Then cauterize the wound after that. For indeed, cautery is very beneficial.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy, and the overgrowths of the nail now press into the flesh on the inside and begin to prick it and injure it, then you must place a thin wire under the corner of the nail that pricks the flesh and push it up; and cut through the flesh with ease and apply to it what remains of medicines from burning, corrosive ones until all of it is removed. ︎ Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
If the rottenness has already taken hold of the wound, then it is necessary that you cut out the wound and remove it; for it will never heal while a putrefied part remains in it.
But if you see the ulcer and rottenness progressing into a finger, then cut it at one of its joints, as was mentioned earlier. Then care for it until it heals.
But if the nail is injured by scraping or blows, and it causes intense pain, then you should first bleed the patient. Then cut the nail with a sharp pointed spoon, making an incision from top to bottom as far as you can see.
And be careful that the incision does not reach the flesh underneath the nail, for you will cause intense pain to the patient, and it will become a cause of unnecessary growth of flesh in the place.
Then care for the place with something that soothes pains.
But an additional finger that is born in the hands of some people is sometimes entirely fleshy; and sometimes there are bones in them, and sometimes there is a nail; and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its growth is at certain joints of the finger. Therefore, that which is born at certain joints of the finger does not move; and that which is born at the root of the joint perhaps moves.  \\
Therefore, for those of them that are fleshy, its incision is easy. That is, you should cut it at its root with a broad spoon.  />
But for those whose growth is at the root of the joint, its treatment is difficult. Therefore, refrain from cutting it.
But for those born at the very tip of the finger, you should first cut its flesh with a round incision until it reaches bone. Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it. Then care for him until he is healed.
The union that occurs between fingers can often happen either from birth, that is, it is born with it, or from the healing of a wound, or from a burn by fire and similar things.
Therefore, one should separate that union until the fingers return to their natural form. Then put between them linens or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly heal together, and separate them; or put between them a thin lead sheet until the place heals as it should.
And similarly, if the union occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that union according to how it is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
¶ About the Incision of a Fistula
A fistula is a twisted vein, swollen and full of black bile that occurs in many parts of the body; most commonly it happens in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and workers who carry heavy loads.
Therefore, you should administer a strong purgative to expel black bile from the body several times.
Then perform phlebotomy on the patient, drawing blood from the basilic vein.
Their treatment with iron is according to two methods. One of them is that they should be cut and the black blood drawn out. And the other method is that the vein should be raised and removed entirely.
Its cutting is done in this manner: First, bathe the leg with very warm water until the thick and foul blood is loosened. 》 Then bind the patient's leg from its upper part near the hip to below the knee with a bandage. 》 》 》 》 》 Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three with a broad incision.
Then elevate, that is, draw blood from the lower part of the leg upwards with the hand, and the phlebotomist should first bleed the patient. Then cut the nail along with it downwards until an amount of blood comes out that you see is sufficient and which the strength of the patient can bear.
Then tie it off and advise him to abstain from foods that produce black bile, and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins fill up and cause harm to the patient.
Its elevation is according to this manner. Scrape the leg of the patient if it has many hairs on it. Then place him in a bath or wrap his leg with hot water until it becomes red and the veins swell up, or have him exercise strongly if there is no bath available until the limb becomes warm.
Then cut the skin along the course of the vein lengthwise or at its lower end near the knee or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks and strip the vein from all sides until it becomes visible to the touch, and at its appearance you will see it reddish towards black. When it emerges from the skin, you will see it white as if it were a string.
Then insert under it a probe until when it is elevated and comes out of the skin; hang it with a blunt hook gently.
Then cut another incision near that incision by three fingers. Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it becomes visible.  /> Then elevate it with probes as you did before, and hang it with another hook as you did at first.
Then cut another section, or multiple sections if you need it. Then lift and cut the last section at the heel.
Then draw it out to the section above it.
And do this until you have drawn it out of the upper or all sections; when it has completely emerged, then cut it.
But if it does not obey you in being drawn out and lifted, then insert a needle with a double thread, tie it off, and draw it out; or insert a probe beneath it, and turn your hand to every part until it comes out. And be careful that it is not cut. For if it is cut, it will be very difficult for you to lift it up, and harm will come to the patient from this.
Therefore, when you have drawn it all out, then place on the wound a wool cloth soaked in wine and rose oil or oil; and care for him until he is healed.
But if the grape is twisted and has a tortuous course with turns and is not as we said straight, then you should make incisions over it at every point of its tortuosity and at the places of its turns.
Then suspend it with hooks until you have lifted it all up; and be careful in your section over it not to cut a vein or cause injury, for it will become difficult for you to lift up or draw out. Therefore, keep your caution.
The form of the incident which heals the grape.
The form of the blind knot.  ?>
It does not have a curve like the other knots, nor is it sharp at the tip so as not to injure a vein; and it has a thick tortuosity, gentle, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein with its fineness; indeed, let there be an excess thickness in it, as we said.
"On the Extraction of a Vein from the Leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Alizegi and Arab lands, and in dry, hot lands where few tender plants grow, that is, where neither grass nor tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as happens with internal worms and roundworms, and the worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein's formation is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg. Then the area becomes blistered. Then the vein begins to emerge from that blistered place, like a root of a plant or an animal.  \\
Therefore, when its end appears, then you should wrap a piece of lead over it, weighing from one drachm keil to two drachms and a nida (unit of weight), and let the suspended lead hang down from the leg.
Whenever something comes out of it to the exterior, wrap that in lead and bind it.  • But if it is greatly elongated, then cut off a part of it and wrap up the rest. And do not cut it at its root until it has all come out. For if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh; and causes an abscess and rotting in that place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it is necessary that it be gently handled and extracted little by little, until it has come out from its end, and nothing of it remains in the body; and from this vein comes out in some people what is in its length five palms and ten. And now it has happened to me, because a man has left with twenty palms.
But if it should happen to you during your treatment: then insert a probe into its opening and perforate it through with a long opening, along with the body, until all that is in it from matter is expelled; and apply putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days. Then treat him according to the method for apostemes (abscesses).
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle or on the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and from each opening a branch emerges.
Therefore treat it as we said in the division, and with what was mentioned before.
¶ About cutting for worms generated under the skin, which is called "bouina" (ox-disease).
This disease is called in a certain land among us "ox-disease," because it often happens to oxen; and there is one small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it travels throughout the whole body, ascending and descending; and it becomes evident to the senses during its movement from member to member, until it breaks out somewhere on the skin and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors. Just as there are also worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms, in the intestines.
And it should be feared because of its harmful nature.  /> It is a very serious disease.  /> When someone is afflicted with this disease, he must be treated according to the following method. Because when it travels through the body and is lifted up to the head and reaches that place, then perhaps it opens there and emerges and destroys the eye; and this happens very often.
Therefore when you want to cure him and extract it, then this cannot be done except during its movement and appearance to the senses.
Therefore, you should tie what is above him and what is below him with a strong ligature. Then cut above him and extract it.
If he sinks into the flesh and you do not find him, then place a cautery with fire on that spot until it dies.
And what is to be feared most is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
But if you see that he has already reached the head near the eye, then tie a good ligature above him on the eyebrow. Then cut above him and extract it.
And the sick person should use cleansing of his body with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods that cause putrefaction.
On the incision for the disease called Nakir.
This disease is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in certain members; then it changes from one member to another.
And indeed I myself have already seen this, as I narrate to you. > I was called to a sick woman in certain villages. And she exposed her arm, and I saw a small swelling on the vein of the forearm.
And after I stayed there for one hour, I saw a swelling advance with heat, as if advancing like a worm, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than is possible; it was like living silver when it runs from place to place.
Therefore the pain withdrew from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Then I stayed there for one hour, and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm. >
Then she told me that it would turn around in her whole body, as I saw.
I have observed the speed of its transition from one limb to another. And indeed before that, I had not seen this disease in my eyes as such. However, I have seen many who find the pain changing from limb to limb; and I did not see it myself as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think that this is the case except because she was one of those who are from dry bodies with detectable veins; hence it appears to the senses that this wind has changed.  />  Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quia mulier erat ex illis qui sunt de uillis corporum sicci detegitarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui ea uentositas permutata.  />  And I do not think that this is the case except because she was one of those who are from dry bodies with detectable veins; hence it appears to the senses that this wind has changed.
And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delicate and of moist bodies with hidden veins.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it and the patient feels that pain, then if it is visible to your eye as we have said, quickly string above it and below it; and cut above it until that wind, constricted, comes out; and cauterize the place.  />
If however you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with purging the body, and with that which expels winds, and drive them out with foul-smelling pills, and with pills of celery, and similar things.
¶ On the Extraction of Arrows.
Arrows are distinguished according to their kinds and according to the places into which they fall from the body.
Their variety is such that among them are those which have large points and small ones; and hollow ones and blunt ones. And among these are those which have three corners. And among them there are tongues. And among them there are stars.
But those which fall according to the members are of two kinds. Or the members are from the main hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestine, bladder, and similar things. Therefore, when a missile falls into any of these members and the signs of death, which I will tell you about afterwards, appear to you, then it is necessary for you to extract that missile from them, because death follows him in whom it is, in many cases. And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the missile is not hidden deep in the member, then extract it and care for the wound.
For the signs of the brain when a missile falls into it and penetrates the nose and exits through the fontanel that is above the brain are: because severe convulsions, blindness, vertigo, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile occur. And sometimes blood comes out of the nose or ears. And sometimes speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed. And from the place of the wound comes out a white liquid like gruel. And from it comes something like the moisture of flesh.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treating it, and extract the missile if it does not come out.
The signs of a missile when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and he feels with it as if it were fixed in something hard, not in something hollow. 》 And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to that of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound. And it is followed by coldness in the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting. Know therefore that death has certainly descended.
And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is that frothy blood flows from the wound, and the vessels following the neck become inflamed, and the color of the patient changes. And he exhales a large, deep breath, and seeks cold air.
If the arrow falls into the diaphragm, which is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great panting with severe pain and sighing, and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out of the wound with the food.
And if the arrow falls into the belly and is fixed there, then something of feces comes out of the wound, or a little piece of gut or an already torn intestine. There is therefore no hope for his cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
But if the arrow falls into the bladder and urine comes out, and something protrudes to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the patient, then know that it is fatal.
The other members, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders, arms, ribs of the back, clavicle, hip, leg, and similar from the limbs are cured in many ways, provided that the arrow does not find an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned.
And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may know it for your cure.
Which is, that a certain man had an arrow fall into the lacrimal of his eye, at the root of the nose. I removed it from her on the other side, under the fat of her ear; and she was healed, and nothing happened to her eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained nothing from it except a small part of its end, to which its wood adhered; and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with a soft iron, in which there are no barbs.
Therefore, the Jew was healed, and nothing evil happened to his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Christian's throat.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and that one has barbs. Therefore, I cut above it between the two windpipes; and it was already sunk into his throat. Therefore, I was careful with it until I removed it; and the Christian was healed.
And I removed another arrow from a man who had it fall into his abdomen; and we thought that he would die from it.  ?>
After thirty days had passed and nothing of his condition had changed, I cut above the arrow; and I split it open, and I removed it; and he was healed, and no evil befell him.
And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound above it had healed over.  ?> After seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the base of his thigh.
And I saw a woman into whose abdomen an arrow had fallen, and the wound above it had healed over, and the arrow remained inside her; and nothing of her condition changed, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man whose arrow fell into his face; and the wound healed, leaving a little pain, and many similar cases like these.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's nobles, which had fallen into the middle of his nose and then turned slightly towards the right side; and the entire arrow was hidden.
Therefore I was called to treat him after the incident with the arrow for three days. I found therefore that the wound of the arrow was very tight.
Therefore I examined it with a fine probe and did not feel it; but he himself found the puncture and pain under his right ear. Therefore I hoped that this was the puncture from the tip of the arrow.
Therefore I applied a plaster to the place with attracting and digestive power, hoping that the place would swell up and show me the sign of the arrow so that I could cut above it; and no incident occurred in the place indicating that the arrow had reached there.
Therefore I continued with the plaster on him for many days; and no incident occurred, and the wound healed meanwhile; but he remained weak from its extraction for several days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. And he told me this.
And he told me this. Therefore I placed an acute, corrosive medicine on this wound for many days until it opened up; and when I probed it with a probe, I felt the fine tip of the arrow attached to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound with this acute medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared to us visibly; and about four months passed with him.
Then after the wound had increased and it was possible for me to introduce tweezers into it and move it, but it did not obey to come out; then I did not cease refining and contriving over it with various devices until one day I began on it with well-made tweezers, according to the form that will appear at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it. Then I repaired the wound.
And indeed doctors judge that the nasal cartilage cannot be restored. Therefore I repaired it [the nasal cartilage], and the wound became consolidated, and the patient was healed with complete health; nothing at all harmed him.
And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows, so that you may take it as a rule and example for what I did not say.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with narration, nor does the book comprehend it; and a wise craftsman compares little to much, and what is present to what is absent; and he finds a new operation and a new instrument for descending into foreign matters of this art when they occur.  (Here, "foreign" refers to things outside of the usual scope of the art.)
I say therefore that arrows do not come out of the members in which they are fixed except by two methods. Or by pulling from the place into which it entered. Or by the contrary action on the other part [of the arrow].
And that which comes out from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place and is pulled out;
But if it does not come out at the time of its fall, then you must leave it for a few days until the flesh around it begins to putrefy; and its pulling out is relieved, and its removal becomes easier.
And similarly, if it is fixed in bone and does not come out to you at the time of its fall, then leave it also for a few days; and tug on it with attraction and movement every day until it comes out.
But if it does not come out to you after the days, then you must pierce around the arrow in the very bone from every side with a fine drill until the arrowhead becomes enlarged. Then pull it out and extract it.
But if the arrow has already hidden itself within the body and is concealed and hidden from sensation: then seek it with a probe. If you feel it, then pull it out with some instruments that are suitable for its extraction.  />
If you cannot reach it because of the constriction of the wound and because of the length of the arrow deep within: and there is no bone, or nerve, or vein there: then make an incision over it until the wound is enlarged and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
But if there are ears on which it is lodged, then free the flesh fixed in them from every side, by any means you can do that, and endeavor, if it cannot be extracted because of the fracture of the ears and their contortion, until it comes out.
And you, when you administer the extraction of an arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand with pincers to all parts, until you make it come out: and be very careful not to break the arrow and make its attraction and extraction difficult for you.
If you cannot remove it in one hour, then leave it for some days until what is around it putrefies. Then reopen it; for the skin will be relieved. But if bleeding opposes you, then administer what we said in its treatment in its own chapter; and protect your virtue from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And administer the remedy in every way possible for avoidance of a dart; and let it be with ease, and calmness, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that when you draw the dart, the patient should be weak according to the figure as it was in the case of the dart itself. Because it is more beneficial. But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the figures.
But if the dart emerges from the opposite side of the other part, or if something already protrudes to the exterior; or if the tip of the dart causes a prominence by touch on the nearby upper skin surface, and you see it standing out: cut over it, and let the incision be according to the quantity that forceps can grasp in it.
Then draw it; for it becomes easy for exiting.
But if it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand according to the roundness, until the dart imprints on the bone and enlarges itself; then draw it out.
And if not: leave it for some days; then reopen it until it comes out.
But if the dart has a wooden shaft, then push it out with it.
But if the wooden shaft has fallen off and you want to administer a push: then insert into it a hollow instrument, so that its concavity enters into the tail of the dart; then push it out with it.
If however the arrow is barbed, then push it through with an instrument that enters into it. For the arrow will be relieved by this.
But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut out all the flesh in which the poison is found; if you are able to do this. Then treat it with what is suitable for that.
But if the arrow has fallen into the chest, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side; and it is close to what you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then, whether the wound, if you see [it], treat that until it heals.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are removed.
Let the ends be similar to the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp over an arrow, they do not release it.
And many forms are made from them, large and small and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and its narrowness, and the width of the wound and its tightness.
The form of a barbed pusher.
And the form of a blunt pusher.
This is the end of a blunt instrument like a radius, so that its entry into a barbed arrow may be relieved, and it may be pushed along with it.
¶ On bleeding veins.
The veins that are customarily bled are thirty.
Of which sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins that are behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries that appear in the two temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "the observers"; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the tip of the nose. And two Guidicei, which are in the neck. And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two veins which are in the lower lip. And these are the veins called Algecherich. And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins which are used for bloodletting in the arms are five in each arm.
One of them is called the Cephalic and it comes from the outer side; and the common people call it the vein of the head. And the Dark Vein. And it is the Median vein, and it consists of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic; and the common people call it the body vein. ())); And the Basilic, which is located on the inner side, and it is also called Titillicaris. And the common people call it the vein of the belly. And the Funis brachii, which is located above the elbow; and this is the one used for bloodletting, and it is clearly visible above the thumb.
And Saluatella: and this is a vein which is between the ring finger and little finger; and it has two branches.
And in the leg and foot there are three veins. One of them is located under the thumb's nail on the outer side. ))) 1037 And the second is called the Saphenous, and its location is near the heel on the inner side. ))) 1040 ))) 1056 ))) 1072 And the vein called Nesse, and its location is near the heel on the outer side.
And in the other part of the leg there are three veins similar to those mentioned above.
¶ Concerning bloodletting from the two veins behind the ears.
Bloodletting from the two veins behind the ears is beneficial for old catarrhs, and migraine, and sahafat, and old sores of the head.
And the method of venesection for this [condition] is as I describe. And the procedure is to shave the head of the patient; and to rub his occipital region, where the two veins are located, with a coarse cloth, using good friction. Then the patient should tighten his neck with a band, until the two veins appear. And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head. Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark that spot with caustic.  /> Et incide eam cum culello bene acuto, et sume tantum quantitatem quam tibi placet de sanguine eius.
Then take the venesection knife, and it is called the cutting knife. Then insert [the knife] under the vein into the skin, until the venesection reaches the mouth of the vein. Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin using a transverse incision. And let the length of the incision be two finger-widths joined together, or about that; and allow as much blood to flow out as you wish.
Then bind it with small bandages, and leave it until it heals.
And now at the beginning of the book, the incision and cauterization of these [veins] have been discussed previously.
Indeed, venesection of the two arteries that are in the temples is beneficial for chronic migraine, malignant headache, persistent eye strain, and acute discharge of humors to the eyes.
And the method of venesection for these [arteries] is as I tell you.  /> Radatur caput infirmi, et fricetur capitulum eius cum panno aspero frictionis bona. The patient should tighten his neck strongly, until the two veins become clearly visible and their pulse can be felt under your finger. Then indeed signs with wax.
Then raise the skin above the vein towards the top with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, raising the vein upwards. And cut it as you did with the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then release the constriction of the patient, and place your finger over the vein for one hour. Then place a bandage and wool over it, and bind it tightly on top; and leave it until it heals.
And now the description of them has preceded, and their cutting, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
The benefit of venesection of the forehead vein is after cephalic venesection for old facial diseases, and for migraine, and redness, and foul ulcers.
And its quality of venesection is as I tell you. Let the patient constrict his neck with a band until the vein appears. Then take an instrument called a Fossorium. ︎
Place the prominent point that is at the end of the Fossorium over the vein, and strike it with a comb or another similar object; and let the blood flow according to your wish. Then release the constriction of the patient, and bind it until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide lancet. However, it should not be a sharp-pointed lancet like the others; rather, it should have a broad point. ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ And the lancet should incise it according to its course, because the opening is near; and perhaps in it a sharp lancet may break when it is thin.
The remedy for the two veins that are in the two lacrimal sacs of the two eyes is for scabs and redness of the eye, and for a growth in the eye, and for diseases of the face.
And the nature of bleeding from them is that the patient should bind their neck with a bandage. Then bleed from them, and you should stand over his head.
And let the bleeding be made across the width rather than the length, with a small lancet, somewhat wide, for there is no flesh in that place. For if the lancet is too fine at the tip, it might break.
Then let as much blood run out as you need. And place cotton over them, and bind them for one night, and then unbind them. ︎
Bleeding from the veins of the nose is useful for acute fever and severe headache, and for diseases of the face, such as migraine and redness that appears on the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the nature of this bleeding is that the patient should bind their neck. Then hold the patient's nose with your left hand, and take a fine, long lancet, and insert it into the middle of the nostril, between that which separates the nose straight. ︎  Because the vein cannot be felt there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you move your hand with the lancet slightly and let as much blood run out as you need. Then bind it for one night. For it heals quickly.
"Indeed, two of the uses of phlebotomy according to Abulcasis are for shortness of breath, leprosy, melancholic illnesses, impetigo and malignant ulcers, and corrosives, that is, herpes simplex.
"And the manner of these bloodlettings is that the patient is tied under both ears on their neck with a bandage: and let the practitioner stand over the head of the patient, and the patient be seated.
"Then the practitioner should open a vein for a large bloodletting to its full length. "Then draw out from the blood a moderate amount, or as much as you see is necessary for that purpose. "Then do likewise with another vein.
"Afterwards, loosen the bandage and bind the two veins tightly in the middle, so that the patient is not overly weakened. "And leave it (the bandage) until morning. "For the wound will heal.
"¶ On bloodletting from the veins according to al-Zahrawi. "The uses of bloodletting from the veins according to al-Zahrawi are for aphthous ulcers in the mouth, gum infection, malignant ulcers, and lip fissures, as well as malignant ulcers in the nose and around it.
"And the manner of these bloodlettings is that you should have the patient sit before you and bind their neck with a bandage. "Then turn back the lip and look for the two veins, one from the right side of the lip and the other from the left; both are indicated by their blackness. "And this is true, for around them are tiny black veins." › "Cut both with an oblique cut.
"But if you are unsure and do not know which is the larger one, then proceed to cut the more prominent of the two veins.
And likewise, do the same with two veins that are in the upper lip; indeed, custom runs mostly with it. And cut two veins that are in the lower lip.
After bloodletting from the sublingual vein following cephalic vein bloodletting. However, the benefit of bloodletting from two veins under the tongue is that it is for pre-conditions in the throat, inflammation of the tonsils, and conditions of the mouth.
And the manner of bloodletting them is that the patient sits between your hands facing the sun; and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for another vein; and the color of both inclines towards blackness.
Therefore, bloodlet both; and be careful not to end your hand in bloodletting them. For under it are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries will occur.
There are three veins that are bloodletted in the elbow; the custom of bloodletting them has run among all men.
And their bloodletting is done in two ways. Either by pricking with a wide myrtle bloodletting instrument, or with a needle made thin and pointed; or by cutting with a surgical knife, which is an al-nisi.   And this is its form.
And from them are broad and thin forms according to the width of the veins and their narrowness. The form of a myrtle bloodletting instrument should be broad, as you see. And it is suitable for opening hollow veins, full veins, projecting veins, visible veins, large veins, and those that contain thick, cloudy blood.   
And this vein is narrower and more delicate at its extremities.
And it applies to the phlebotomy of fine veins that contain fine yellowish blood
But the basilic is one of these three veins, and its phlebotomy is beneficial. Because it draws blood from diseases that are under the throat and neck, since it follows the chest and belly; and it is fitting for the phlebotomist to be cautious when he bleeds this vein, because there is an artery beneath it. Therefore, if he errs and increases the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will result. Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to puncture her with a phlebotome; or rather, he should cut with Alnesil.
But if the basilic does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to displace it and change to another, or seek some branch of it; or instead of the phlebotome, use a thread from the arm. For she is clear to see, and cut her with the Anesil phlebotome, as we have said.
But if you wish to bleed her from the same place, then it is necessary first to bind the arm tightly, so that you may touch the spot until you find the pulse's place. Then mark the spot with wax, afterwards bind the arm tightly, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the Anesil phlebotome, as we have said. And be careful that the puncture does not fall through the space to the place of the artery.
And when you see, after binding the ligature, swelling at the place which you marked with wax, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery; therefore avoid it.
"If you see the blood during bleeding jump like a boy's urine and it is fine, red; then know that it is from an artery. Then hasten and place your finger on it with a long space, then remove your finger. If the blood is cut off (for often it is cut off), then bind the arm and leave it, and the patient should be cautious about moving it, and he should keep still out of fear.
And he should not move it for several days until it heals.
But if the blood is not cut off and it overcomes you, and you do not have medicine at hand in that moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you. For its ends contract, and the blood is cut off.
Or take the bark of a fig tree and pound it; take one half and bind it over the place of the vein with a suitable bandage, with thread and wool until another day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good. And if not, then care for it with that of which the previous memory was reminded for cutting off the flow of blood; and its cutting off is not difficult in many positions because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of tying from the arm.
However, the bleeding of the dark vein is a beneficial procedure because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica and a branch of the Cephalic, as we have said.  />
And it is fitting for the one bleeding this vein to be careful, because under it there is a nerve.  />  \\ Therefore, if he errs in the puncture and finds a nerve, a shock occurs, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it does not heal at all.
This nerve often appears to be sensitive. But if it is hidden in some people and is thin and does not show itself, then you should place your bloodletting where you can bleed with the help of alnus-wood, and avoid the nerve with all your might.
But if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
About the cephalic vein. But bloodletting of the cephalic vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and helps with eye diseases.
And in this vein you should bleed with a blunt lancet or a myrtle lancet if you wish, because it is safer than all other veins, since there is no artery beneath it, nor any nerve. 》
However, it is appropriate for you during bloodletting to avoid the head of the biceps with the lancet and seek a softer place: and it does no harm if the vein is not found on the first strike, that you strike over it several times with the lancet.
However, perhaps it becomes swollen in some people if it is not found on the first strike, but that swelling does no harm to anyone. 》 》
About the usefulness of bloodletting and the precautions to be observed in it. 》 The quality and effects of bloodletting depend on the person whose condition you are correcting.
Therefore, first you should know that bloodletting is not administered except for the preservation of health and its continuation and precaution against the approach of diseases. 》 》 》 》 》 》
And let bloodletting be done on one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the cephalic, the dark, and the basilic. 》 》 》 》 》 And to perform a bloodletting at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer; and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of fullness appear.
And let the bloodletting be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed from the day.
But the bloodletting that is administered in illnesses does not have a fixed time; but when suitable and necessary conditions call for it, at night or day, and at every hour, and in every season.
And children should not be bled until they are fourteen years old. Nor should a pregnant woman be bled unless from the fourth to the seventh month. And old men who have already passed sixty years should not be bled.
Therefore, when someone wants to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that he cleanse his intestines before the bloodletting with a gentle enema, if much feces are retained within them; so that during the bloodletting, the veins do not draw harmful putrid excess from the intestines into the principal members.
Nor should the patient who is suffering from toctina (i.e., nauseating fullness) be bled, nor one who is drunk or recovering from drunkenness, until it is removed from them. Nor a sick person with dropsy.
And one should avoid bloodletting again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, labor, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, and everything else that weakens the strength from bodily or animal substance. ➤
Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines; if it is possible for him, let him do it.
Then let him enter the bath, if nothing prevents him; or he should exercise in some way, so that the blood may be made subtle.
And place his bloodletting in the chest, around the third day, as we said: and strive that on that day his chest be evacuated of all harmful animal accidents such as distress, anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents such as labor, punishment, excess, and similar things.
And let him make present things for his seat from those with which human custom has run through usage, such as fragrance, scent, and joy, and similar things, in a possible amount.
Then let the bloodletter sit on a seat higher than the bleeding seat; afterwards, he shall extend his arm and rub it himself with his hand twice or three times. Then let him bind the string with a cord and wrap it around twice.
And let the binding be moderate, for a binding that is unequal or too tight hinders the flow of blood; and likewise, if it is too loose, it also hinders the flow of blood.
Then after binding, it is necessary for the one to be bled to rub his hands together until the veins swell and become perceptible.
Then let the bloodletter clean the bleeding site with a little old oil properly.
Then let him place the index finger of his left hand lightly on the vein below the spot where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and the blow is missed. For some veins are like a fleeing string at the time of bleeding; and there are those that are full of air; and when you place the incision on them, they contract under the blade and deceive the bloodletter, so that the incision does not open the vein; and if it opens it, it is tight; therefore, let the bloodletter be firm and attentive in all these things.
Then he will set down the bloodletting instrument. If, therefore, the vein is opened by one incision, then it is good. And if not, then try again with another incision in that place, or above it hastily, if the area does not become inflamed.
If the site becomes inflamed or the patient fears it, then leave him for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage. For perhaps a hot abscess may be drawn out. Nor should he enter the bath.
Then he should repeat the bloodletting if he wishes.
If the opening is small, or if the blood runs thinly and you fear that not enough will flow out as desired, then repeat the bloodletting in the same hole, along its length, adding a little to your procedure.
And do this quickly, before the site becomes inflamed, for an inflamed site is common in many people during a small operation.
Therefore, if you see that it is already inflamed, then do not repeat on the same spot at all, for it will not work for you in any case. And place some of the oil's dregs upon it, for this soothes the flow of blood. And this is better in this case than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And likewise administer the oil's dregs in every bloodletting of yours where you prevent the flow of blood, as do theriac and alfalfa when one of them is placed on the site.
For the blood becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick.
If a large abscess occurs at the site of bloodletting, for this often happens, especially to those who are not usually bled or if the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and place upon the site a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly; and bind it on for one hour, for this dissolves [the abscess]. >()
And you should do this after the blood has left that vein, either at its end or from another vein.
If some blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it does not matter. And if you wish, put something dissolved from aloe or myrrh on it; or something from the juice of peppermint, that is, pennyroyal, or something similar to it.
And indeed, swellings and prominences often occur with the bloodletting of the Basilic vein.
Therefore, place your hand on it; if you find softness under your pressure upon it, then that prominence is bad. Beware therefore to put anything on it from what we have said. For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
But make a plaster for it with that which has an astringent property, so that the place may be hardened. Then care for him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
And it is necessary to draw blood from every person according to their strength. And that which appears from the prevailing color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it cease to flow until it becomes red; and likewise, if you see it thick, then let it stop until it becomes thin; and likewise, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary that he who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the venesection of the vein be increased, and let the incision be wide; and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of this.
And it is necessary to draw from him in intervals, and that the opening be narrow; and better in venesection of the vein is that there be a transverse cut, not a prick.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from excessive bleeding and from cutting the nerve, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
And one who is accustomed to fainting during bloodletting should eat before the procedure a moderate amount of bread soaked in pomegranate juice or wine if it is heated; and you should draw out the blood from him in three or four stages.
And if he has a cold temperament, then before bloodletting let him eat bread soaked in syrup of myrobalan or sweetened with honey and spices, or in aromatic syrup.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting and the cause is much bleeding, then he should drink water from broth and a thin aromatic syrup; and let him use aromatics with almonds and anoint his chest with it; and let him use the other things that we mentioned in the division of the chapter on fainting after evacuation.
But one who wants to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time should do so gradually according to the strength of the bloodletting, day by day.
But if he who wants to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time has a strong body, then let him do this after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
But if one wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side than to which it inclines, then let him be bled on the second or third day.
In whose body the blood is already heated and sharpened, causing fever to arise, it is necessary for blood to come out in one go, and a large quantity should be drawn; and the opening should be widened until fainting occurs. Afterwards, observe all the conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of fainting. Often indeed this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and carelessness sets in.
And it is not fitting that when one wishes to release the arm and let out blood a second time, after the orifice of the vein has already been closed and exit of the blood becomes difficult, that pressure be applied over it with force, and that it be quickly stretched outwards. For that is very bad; indeed, leave it alone until it has been phlebotomized a second time.
Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomy that which has clotted from the blood at the vein's orifice, and place over it some salt dissolved in water. And place over it some theriac of alfaroqh or sajzeena, and apply a gentle pressure until the blood comes out.
But if the vein has already become swollen, then leave it alone and do not cover it until the swelling subsides.
But if necessity compels one to let out blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize over the same place or in another vein of another arm.
The cord of the arm is phlebotomized at the place called the Dark Vein and the Imperial Vein, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed from them.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the patient should put his hand into warm water until it reddens and the vein appears clearly.
Then let it be tied over it with a bandage of moderate tightness. Then let the phlebotomy be made transversely, little by little, not latitudinally, nor along its length; and let the opening be wide; and your phlebotomy should be such that you phlebotomize it over the wrist a little.  />
But if the exit of blood is hindered, then immerse your hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your need.
If however you are in the days of summer, then abstain from washing your hands in hot water. And indeed the course of blood is greatly increased in hot water in winter.
And venesection of this vein is safer than all other veins because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
However, venesection of the right hand of the Saluatella is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the quality of its venesection is that you should tie a band around the hand with a ligament, or your own hand, after you have inserted it into hot water until the vein swells and becomes very perceptible to touch. Then make an incision in it by cutting across. And if you cut it completely through, it will not harm him in any way.
And take care not to cut your hand with the lancet. For beneath it are the bare nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh. 》
Then dip your hand again in hot water and let the blood flow into it. For if you do not dip it in hot water, the blood will clot at the mouth of the vein and be prevented from flowing.
When you have drawn out as much blood as is necessary, then place on the vein oil and salt, so that it may not heal quickly. 》
And likewise it should be done with every tied-off branch. 》
However, the benefit of venesection from the left hand is that it is beneficial for spleen diseases. Do the same with its venesection as you did with the second one equally.
The benefit of saphenous vein venesection is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as uterine diseases, retention of menses, kidney illnesses, old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar conditions.
And the quality of its venesection is that the patient puts his foot into warm water and makes a rubbing until the veins swell; and bind above the ankle with a strap. And the place of the veins is at the heel, appearing towards the big toe; and many branches extend from it on the sole of the foot.
Therefore, let venesection be done in its wider branch or at the heel in its collection; because it is better and safer.
But if you venesect it on the sole of the foot, then be careful not to cut into the nerves that are beneath it on the sole of the foot.
And place your venesection so that you venesect it from the side, as if you wanted to cut across it; and let the venesector be Nasil.
But if the flow of blood is blocked, then dip his foot into warm water and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated.
But if the venesector errs in the first attempt, then repeat the venesection a little higher up; for it is a safe place and you need not fear harm when you avoid the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The place of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel on the side towards the little toe.
And the benefit of its venesection is for pain in the ankle when it is due to hot blood.  />
And the quality of its venesection is that the patient enters the bath and bathes quickly; and bind his leg from the side of the ankle up to above the heel with four fingers' width, using a thin, long bandage; for it does not appear except through that.
Therefore, when it appears, then venesect it in whatever way is possible for you; either by transverse venesection, which is better, or by making an incision or a section. The place of it is safer, and it is hidden greatly in many people.
The place of it is safer, and it is hidden greatly in many people. If you do not find it and it does not appear to the touch at all: then make an incision in some of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the sole of the foot and towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and let a quantity of blood flow from it as much as you wish.
Then release the constriction, and place a piece of skin over the place of the incision, and bind the place. For it heals quickly.
¶ On Cupping and its Usefulness.
Cups are made from horns, and from metal, and from glass.
And cupping is done in two ways. With scarification and bloodletting; the other way is without scarification.
And this cupping which is without scarification, is done in two ways. For it is either with fire. Or without fire.
And the cups which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are applied to fourteen places on the body. One of these is the cupping on Alnocrat, which is at the base of the skull; and Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck; and the cups called Alhagdahim, which are two, placed on either side of the neck together; and the cup for the chin, which is under the jaw on the lower part of the face; and the cups for the two shoulders; and the cup for the end of the tail; and the cups for the two groins, which are in the middle of the two thighs; and the cups for the two knees. />
And cupping does not draw blood from the small dispersed veins in the flesh, and because of this it does not cause weakness as happens with bloodletting. And it is not appropriate to administer cupping, either with fire or without fire, for any illnesses that arise from fullness until the entire body is evacuated.
If necessity compels one to cupping due to illness or habit, we administer it at any time of the month: at the beginning, the middle, and the end.
This is because there are men who, when their blood increases until they need its extraction through cupping, find heaviness and headache.
And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. And among them are those who find itching in their face and forehead, darkness and dullness in their eyes.  /> And there are some who, when blood increases in them to the point of needing extraction through cupping, experience pain in their kidneys and groin.
And among them are those who itch the site of their cupping. And among them is he whose laughter increases. And among them is he who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or his tongue swells and he spits blood. And among them is he whose sleep increases.  /> And there are those who, when their blood increases until they need its extraction through cupping, experience pain in various parts of their body. And among them is he who sees blood and redness, the dead, wounds, and similar things in his sleep.
Therefore, when we see any of these things and especially if it is in the third week of the month, we advise cupping to be done after two or three hours have passed.
The benefit of cupping the back of the neck is that it helps with heaviness in the head and what is released goes to the eyes. However, this should be done after the evacuation of the entire body.
And this cupping is the equivalent of cephalic bloodletting.
And it is not permitted for one of cold temperament, or who has a cold, to use it. For it causes great harm to him.
And because of this, it is not fitting that the elderly use it, or those whose heads are afflicted with cold illnesses.
But if one becomes habituated to it, memory loss occurs in him.
And because of this, it is necessary to instruct the cupping therapist to briefly lower his hand with the cup towards the lower parts, fearing the onset of memory loss.
Cupping or Alkehel is effective in place of dark bloodletting and basilica bloodletting, and for this reason it benefits asthma, chest tightness, breathlessness, broken ribs, cough, and congestion.
And it is necessary to briefly apply the cup of Alkehel, because if it is placed lower down, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
However, cupping of the alhagdahim is beneficial for headaches, eye diseases, migraines, sinus problems, and toothache; and it takes the place of basilica bloodletting.
And it is necessary to instruct the cupping therapist not to press too hard with the scarification: so that he does not cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.   Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.
Cupping under the chin is beneficial for mouth ulcers, gum disease, and similar oral conditions; it serves as a substitute for bloodletting on the lips.
Cupping with the spoon-shaped instrument is beneficial for acute fever, which arises from congestion and heat.
Cupping the inner parts of the two thighs is as beneficial as bloodletting from the three veins – basilica, dark, and cephalic; for it draws blood from all the small veins in the flesh, and those small veins draw from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three main veins.   Ventosatio autem alueoli, confert in egritudinibus pectoris: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae, et Fuscae: quoniam peruenit ad uenas interiores cardinis: et sunt ibi omnes uenae Basilicae, et Fuscae.
And you should instruct the Cupping Specialist not to proceed too much with scarification, because the place is bare of flesh and beneath it are nerves and blood vessels.
And cupping over the Alchausos [area] is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
And you should instruct the Cupping Specialist to use a large cupping glass and one made of metal, because this place needs strong suction, and perhaps delicate glasses may break; and it should be scarified with a deep incision.
But cupping of the legs reduces manifestly, because it draws blood from the entire body and is beneficial for old pains in the kidneys, womb, and bladder; it provokes menstruation, and is beneficial for bothrosis and adamantinum [conditions?]; and it takes the place of bleeding two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Nevertheless, they greatly weaken the body and cause fainting in many people.
And cupping of the alhorcobeni is almost as beneficial as cupping both legs.
The quality of the positioning of the cupping glasses is that you should first place the glass empty and draw with moderate suction; and do not prolong the positioning of the glasses, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors may come to the place equally; and do not cease to repeat and continue this, until you see the place already turning red and swelling, and the redness of blood appears; then scarify, and continue with gradual suction. Then consider in the disposition of bodies [i.e., of patients].
For a person who is delicate in flesh and has large pores, you should scarify him only once, not more, so that the place does not become ulcerated.
And instruct the Cupping Specialist to widen the scarification and make it shallow; and to regulate the suction with ease, speed, and gentle movement.
If there is a thickening of the blood, then it is necessary that you cauterize him twice. Indeed, the first cauterization opens the way to the thinning and moistening of the blood, and the second cauterization thoroughly searches out and extracts the thick blood.
However, if the blood is very foul, then let there be a third cauterization, so that it may come to an end.
And finally, when we want to draw out the blood little by little or temporarily, one cauterization is sufficient for us. If we wish to extract much blood, we cauterize with many cauterizations.
And if we judge that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to cauterize with a deep cauterization, and the equal limit of depth in the cauterization is the thickness of the skin.
¶ What is that which ought to be administered from the oils at the position of the kidneys, and what should the one performing cupping avoid?
In the case of a person whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are constricted, it is necessary to anoint the places where the cups will be applied with open, soothing, dissolving oils; if it is in summer, such as alkeiri oil, or violet oil, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seeds.
And if it is in winter, then use oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or oil of safflower, and similar oils.
However, if the excess is thick and cold, then let the oil be made from ammi, or balsam oil, or oil of sweet basil, or oil of dill, and similar oils. ●
If the person to be cupped has large pores and soft flesh, then it is necessary to prevent him from using oil, and it is necessary for these persons to wash the places of the cups with rose water or cold water or saltwater or pumpkin water or purslane water, and similar waters.
The person whose blood is very moist should rinse wind-related conditions with vinegar or myrtle water and sumac, and similar things.
The person whose discharges are thick should rinse their wind-related conditions with old wine or sumac water, or anise infusion, or chamomile, and similar things.
And it is necessary to avoid wind-related conditions in the bath or in the vicinity of the bath; indeed, it is necessary that a remedy be given after leaving the bath for an hour or two hours.
And it is not appropriate for someone to sleep after experiencing wind-related conditions.
¶ What should be used to treat the ventoses or the phlebotomized person before wind-related conditions?
And after that you should consider first whether the ventosed or phlebotomized person is choleric and whether sharpness and inflammation predominate over his blood; then it is necessary for him to receive cooling substances, such as pomegranate juice, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and chicory, and vetch; and similar things.
And let his food be moist, and let him eat lean mutton, and let his dishes be seasoned with sour (foods); and similar things.
And the person whose temperament is cold should drink syrup made of honey or almonds, or a decoction of seeds; and he should drink moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new; and it is recommended that he use a small amount of food. And let his food be moist, and let him eat quail and thrushes, that is, small birds; and he should eat the meat of young pigeons.
And it is necessary that on the day of ventosing and phlebotomy the drink should be more than the food; and it is necessary to give in some people's drink theriac or alfaroch in certain hours before ventosing, or before phlebotomy, or after, so that the main limbs are strengthened and the blood is made subtle. And it is not necessary for them to take it in hot drink.
On Venesection without Scarification Venesections without scarification are those placed on the liver, spleen, gout, abdomen, navel, and the kidney area; because these parts of the body do not tolerate scarification.
And through these [venesections], we do not seek anything other than the drawing of blood from one part to another, such as when we place a venesection on the breasts in the case of nosebleed. And we use them to dissolve the cold and unpleasant fullness from one part of the body into another, such as when we place a venesection on the abdomen and navel. For it rarefies the part of the body [and] heats it up and removes pain because it dissolves that fullness.
It is also placed on the kidneys when there occurs in them a stone or calculus. For perhaps by the power of its attractive nature it opens up the stone or extracts the stone from its place.
And similarly when it is placed on the liver and spleen for treating fullness in both organs.
And these venesections are administered empty, with only a cut. And sometimes they are administered with fire [cautery].
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in cases of pleurisy: and this is done by filling the venesection cup [with warm water] and making it large; with hot water alone or water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The shape of a venesection administered with fire.
Let the width of its opening be that of two extended fingers, as we have described; and let its depth be half a palm; and let there be on one side of it a small hole about the size of what will admit a needle, made from brass or tin, thick-rimmed, smooth, even, polished; so that it does not harm the part where it is placed upon it; and let there be in its center a crosswise rod of brass or iron on which the candle with fire is placed.  [Note: The translation above includes a small correction to the Latin text, changing "eius" to "suum."]
"And now it becomes this large wound, larger than we have described, and somewhat smaller, according to the illnesses and age of the person using it.
"For the windpipes of children and thin individuals are different from those of men and thick-bodied individuals.
"The method of placing this woundpipe with fire on a member is as follows: light linen wick or a small candle made from tallow, and place it on the middle of the crosspiece which is in the middle of the windpipe, so that the fire burns around the lower part of the windpipe, without burning the body of the patient.
"Then place it on the member; and let a finger be over the opening which I mentioned, while we are holding the windpipe. When needed, remove the finger, and the vapor will exit through that opening, and the windpipe will immediately become unblocked.
"Then light the linen wick in its usual manner, and use it again if you need to.
"However, in the windpipe used in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no crosspiece or opening, and it is not applied except when filled with water and placed on the member alone.
"And this is its shape.
"The larger this windpipe is, so that it may hold much water, the better it is.
"About the suspension of cupping glasses.
"Cupping glasses are not applied to many places except where the placement of windpipes is not possible due to their small size, such as the lip and gums, and similar areas. "Or on members that have been stripped of flesh, such as fingers, noses, and similar parts.
"And the way to use them is: come from cupping glasses that are in sweet and pure waters, free from decay." 》
Then they are let go day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and there is nothing left in their stomachs. Then the body is first evacuated with bloodletting and cupping. Then clean the afflicted part until it turns red. Afterwards they are placed on top of it.
When they are full and fall off, and it is possible to draw out the pus with cupping, then this is more beneficial in the end; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar. Then rinse thoroughly with water, rub it, and squeeze it out.
If the flow of blood is prolonged after the fall of leeches, and this is due to sweating, then pour a linen cloth into cold water and place it on top until the sweating ceases.
If the blood increases, then sprinkle powdered alum or oak galls and similar astringents on top until the bleeding stops.
Or place half-peeled broad beans on the spot and let them stay until they stick to the place, for then the bleeding will stop.
And if a repetition of leeches is necessary, when possible, change them.
If, however, the leeches are prevented from taking hold, then clean the place with fresh blood. Or prick with a needle until some blood comes out. Then place them on, for when they sense something from the blood, they immediately stick on.
When you want them to fall off, sprinkle some powdered aloe, salt, or ash on top of them, and they will fall off immediately.
This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine; it deals with the restoration of broken and dislocated bones.
Know, O Sons, that the foolish physicians and common people boast about this chapter, those who have never seen an ancient book nor read a single letter from it.
And for this reason, this method has become rare among the sciences in our land. And I have never encountered anything good in it at all, and I would not have gained from it what I have gained except through the long reading of ancient books and diligent study to understand them, until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Then, throughout my life, I persisted in experimentation and study.
And now I have described to you in this chapter all that my knowledge contains on the subject: and as for what is beyond my experimentation, after abbreviating it for you, I have freed it from the tedium of length, and abbreviated it to the point of abbreviation, and shown it at the point of conclusion. And I have formed in it many shapes from the shapes of instruments used in it, by adding a conclusion, as I did in the two preceding chapters. ➤
Chapter 2
In the preface of this chapter, it is appropriate to state the summaries and topics that are essential for understanding them in the first place: so that you and those who are ready may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
I say, therefore, that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or fall occurs to someone, you should hurry in the first place to bleed him and evacuate him, or both at once: unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength; or he is a child to whom one of those things happened; or he is an old decrepit man; or it is a time of very hot weather, or very cold. ➤
Then let him be content with his food, with cold vegetables and the meat of birds and kids. And forbid wine and heavy meats, and filling up from food and all foods that fill the veins with blood. Until you are secure from the hot swelling, and do not fear the discharge of matter to the member; then let the patient return to his original diet with which he was accustomed.
When the fractured bone begins to heal, then it is necessary that the patient be fed with foods that are very nourishing, thick, heavy, and viscous; such as bread made from cooked wheat with water, rice, heads, feet, and entrails of cows, eggs, and fresh fish: and heavy wine, and similar things. For this diet causes the fracture to heal faster and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in the early stages of old age and decrepit, cannot always be held together and healed according to their nature because of the dryness of their members; but those which are in the last stage of softness heal and come together like the bones of small children. 》
Nevertheless, nature attaches above the fractured bone from every side something similar to glue, which has thickness and by which it adheres and binds itself together until they cohere with one another and are bound together, until it reaches the end of strength and firmness as it was at first, so that nothing prevents it from its own operations. And for this reason, it is necessary that you place the patient's food in nourishments which have heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
And know that the kinds of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the members; for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone, and similarly all other members differ from one another. And I will come with a description of every kind of fracture set forth in its own chapter, distinct from another. And the types of bone fractures are also varied among themselves.
Because it happens that the fracture is curved, besides which stones fall into it. And sometimes the fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and its fractures are staggered, that is, stones, and protruding additions, as they are in a reed when adapted to writing with a knife. And not protruding: and the fracture is accompanied by a wound and rupture at the end: and the fracture is a small cleft.
And every type has its own skill or instrument for its restoration, as will be recalled later, distinguished by their places.
And by which a bone fracture is recognized is its twistedness and prominence; and its appearance to the touch; and the sound it makes when you press it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent twistedness in the place, nor a sound to the touch with movement, and the patient does not experience great pain; then there is no fracture there, but perhaps it is a twist or a small cleft. So you should not move it at all with your hand and pressing, but rather apply on it from the medicines whose reminder comes after the appropriate moment for that place: then let it be bound with a fine bandage.
And know that when the place is curved and split into two, besides which stones fall into it, nevertheless every part will be separated from its partner; then you should begin at the hour for its rectification, leveling it before a hot abscess forms on it.
But if a hot abscess has formed on it, then leave it for some days until the abscess calms down. Then level it by whatever means you can, with gentleness and skill.
And know that its restoration and its equalization is easier than that of bone, in which fractures occur.
Then bind it according to how you remember it.
But if there are fractures in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb from two sides, whether it is a hand or a foot: either with your hand, if it is a small member; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
And your position should be such that you place the member on an equal place, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended: then strive with all skill and in whatever way you can to bring those additions back to their places; and be careful not to cause pain or injury to the weak person due to your operation. And strive as much as you can to join one of the two bones with its mate, according to the best shapes.
And it is necessary at that time for you to test and touch it with your hand. So if you see something different there, correct it, and equalize that according to the quantity of your strength.
And beware of excessive extension and strong compression, as many fools do. For often through their operation they cause a hot abscess or contracture in the member, as we have already seen many times from their operations.
Then after equalization and proper operation and binding of that limb, and rest and peace, instruct the patient concerning it. And make him take care not to move it during his watchfulness and sleep and turning and movement, and in his discharge and all his last movements with all his strength. 》 And so that he may take care not to place the member in a position that causes pain. "For when he feels pain or injury in the position of a limb, then it is necessary that you change it to another position from which he does not feel pain.
"And be careful with him that his position is equal and straight so that there is no twisting in the limb when it is restored.
"The quality of the tightness of a broken limb is as I will describe.
"Know that broken limbs are distinguished by their smallness and size, and also by their shape.
"Therefore, from those that are small, such as the arm, finger, and knee, then it is necessary for there to be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth. "But from those that are thick, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary for there to be a wide, hard wrapping.
"Because the broad ligature joins together a large limb and holds it tightly from all sides with equal tightness, so that no swelling enters into it.
"Then begin to apply a suitable ointment after your equalization on soft cotton wool over the site of the break. "Then begin to wrap the bandage over the site of the break three or four times, according to what the limb deserves; and hold your hand for a moment with the bandage.
"Then go with it to the upper part from the site of the break and tighten less than your previous tightness where you bound the broken site. "Then extend yourself with the wrapping from the break for a short while and gradually lessen the tightness until you take something large from the healthy part.
"Then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken site with bindings. "Afterward, go with the wrapping to the lower part from the break. And let your operation be in the tightening of the swelling, and its softening, according to what we have said about the first upper swelling.
Then place between the swellings some soft tow or cloth, which matches the twist of the break, if there is any twist to it; and if not, do not put anything inside.
Then wrap another bandage over that same roll. Afterward, apply to these bandages some neatly-made plasters of equal size immediately, if there is no swelling or hot abscess at the site.
But if there is swelling or an abscess at the site, then place upon it something to ease that abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for some days. Then bind those plasters over it.
And let the plasters be made from half-reeds, scraped and cleverly shaped; or they may be made of wood from which strainers are made, which are made from pine, or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi; and let the size of every plaster correspond to this shape and this same form.
However, the plaster that is placed over the wound itself should be somewhat thicker and broader than the other plasters; and let the length of the plaster correspond to what is permitted by the member’s size or smallness.
Then bind the plasters with another bandage in the same manner as the first binding. Then tie it securely with neat stitches in the manner that we have described for the binding; and know that your binding should be greater over the site of the break; and as the distance from the break increases, let the binding become smaller.
And know that the thread should be of medium thickness and fineness, and it should be made of soft linen.
For if the thread is thick, as I have seen done by foolish people who use twisted linen cords for their threads, there is a great mistake; because the binding will fall outside the proper manner with them.
And fine threads are not suitable again: because you will not achieve through them what you want.
And it is not fitting for there to be less than a finger's width between the hooks.
But if the patient is injured by the tips of the hooks after the suturing in healthy places, then place soft wool or boiled wool under them until he is no longer harmed by it.
But when there is a fracture with a wound and a tearing of the skin occurs, I will make an exception for it in Chapter Two, one by one.
And know that not every broken bone should be sutured with hooks from the first day. This is because a large bone should not have hooks placed on it unless after five days or seven, or more, according to your assurance against the occurrence of a hot swelling.
And this is the method of plasters by which the ancients used to treat fractures and dislocations.
The method of a common abbreviated plaster for restoring fractures, suitable for most complexions, especially women and children, since it is made from that which neither heat nor cold can overcome.
And it is made by taking the flour dust from the mill, which is the innermost part of the flour that hangs on the walls of the mill during its operation. Prepare this just as it is, except that you should sift it with egg white. And make its preparation neither too thick nor too thin. Then use it.
Another method of plaster for restoring fracture, dislocation, and twisting. Take mastic, labdanum, acacia, henbane, and mustard; and the juice of all of them 10 parts, myrrh and both kinds of aloe 5 parts each, and aleth 20 parts. Grind all together, sift, and mix with aleth water or with egg white if the patient's complexion is hot. Then use this plaster. For it is of good composition, it quickly restores broken bones and helps many people.
Another method for the plaster, which also benefits fractures and dislocations. Take mugwort and mesquite and white althea, all in equal parts, one dram of each; also take myrrh and both kinds of aloe, half a dram of each; and Armenian bole six drams; grind all these together finely, sift them, and prepare with water or egg white.
Another method for the plaster, to be used for dislocations and separated bones from their place; it also eases the pain that occurs in them, bone fissure, and fracture. Take greasy wool, soak it in vinegar and boiled oil, and place it on the site.
And indeed this plaster has no power of restoration, but it is good for the soothing of hot inflammation and properly expels pain.
Another method for the plaster that restores a broken bone. ️ Take leaves of the deaf fig and wild poppy leaves; grind all together and make a plaster from both.
Another method for an abbreviated plaster to be used in the restoration of a bone fracture and when you wish to resolve any remaining inflammation. Take the root of althea, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and cudweed flour, all in equal parts; grind all together and prepare with wine if the limb is not hot.
If it is hot, then prepare it with water of fresh coriander or with water and use that.
Another method for a stronger plaster for the resolution of inflammation than this first one, when a hard inflammation occurs during the restoration of a limb. Recipe of alteae root, flax seed, balaustia, melliloti, samsuci, violet flower, and chamomile, all in equal parts; grind them all together and prepare with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine. All of it should be prepared according to the warmth of the member and the state of its heat.
Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a fractured member at the time of its restoration except for an unguent made from wax and oil—nothing else—and he reported that it is a medium between thickness and thinness.
Galen, however, considered it beneficial to place on a fractured member at the time of its restoration substances that dry out heat, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, and similar things from those we have mentioned.
§ The method of the plaster which is beneficial for injury and pain. Take equal parts of mugwort, chickpea, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, altea, and salt; grind them, sift them, and make a plaster from it.
The quantity in which it should remain until the ligature is dissolved, and then be removed, is that you should consider then if no pain occurs to the patient, nor itching, nor does the broken bone move from its place; then do not remove it for many days. But if intense itching occurs there, or disturbing pain, or swelling, then hasten and remove it at that hour, and take away the plaster from him; and take a soft cloth or a soft marine sponge, wet it; and dip it in warm water and cleanse the place with it until the itching calms and the pain subsides. ¶
But if intense itching occurs there, or disturbing pain, or swelling, then hasten and remove it at that hour, and take away the plaster from him; and take a soft cloth or a soft marine sponge, wet it; and dip it in warm water and cleanse the place with it until the itching calms and the pain subsides. ¶ Then let the part rest for one hour. Then place on it wool that has been cut and soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it on overnight, until you are sure there is no hot swelling, and the inflammation of the part subsides, and its pain is relieved.
Then repeat with a fine binding and a small plaster: and do not bind it too tightly at first, but use gentle bindings with it, until it heals.
If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and all other symptoms have been completely removed, and you no longer need plaster or binding, then repeat as you did at first, equally.
But if none of those things happen to the part, then do not loosen it until after three, four, five, or seven days. And when it is released after twenty days, the whole thing, according to how the part looks upon loosening, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the flesh coagulates over it: then add more to the binding than your first complete binding; and also add to the swelling of the soft food, according to what was done before.
But if you see the place of the fracture already drying out and becoming too thin: then know that the nourishment is prevented from reaching it. Therefore moisten it with warm water whenever you loosen it, and let it be so for all three days, and lighten the binding slightly.
By this method, nourishment reaches the part, and it heals quickly.
What foolish restorers do instead of the above method when a fracture is not restored properly at first, and it is set crookedly, is an error on their part, and a great fear: and if it were right, the ancients would have said so in their books, and they would have done it likewise.
And I did not see anywhere their trace in it at all, and it is better that it should not be done.
On the formation of a wound in the head.
The species of fracture are various and its figures many, and its causes are distinct.
For a fracture occurs which is made by striking with a sword; and the strike removes the bone entirely until it reaches the sphenoid bone, which is under the bone, just as an ax does in wood; and because of this, this species of fracture is called axial.
Or the sword cuts something of the bone and cuts its surface, but the cut does not penetrate to its end; and this species of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, an absolutely smooth incision. ›
And there are two kinds of wounds, either large or small.
And from a fracture is what is called crushing or grinding; and its cause is striking with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar things.
And this fracture can also be either penetrating, which reaches close to the membrane beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone; and there are wounds of these two kinds of fractures, either small or large. › ️
And there is a fracture that is hidden within the bone, as fine as a hair; and it is a small crack, and because of this, this species of fracture is called capillary. › ️ ️
And among these is the fracture that occurs from a fall or striking with a stone and similar things, which cause a fragment of bone to enter into the depths; and in its place there is a hollowing out, just as happens with copper vessels when they are struck, and part of them enters inside. ›
And this occurs most often in the heads of bones that are still soft, such as the heads of children.
And for all these kinds of fractures, splints are separated, and I will come back with a reminder of the whole thing in its proper place.
And we know all these types of fractures by examining them, and probing them with needles, and removing the corrupted flesh that is on them.
But the hair-like species is recognized by this, that it is exposed on the bone and cleaned, and anointed with cautery wax on it, for the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the condition of the patient: then if you see from the signs that it indicates something clear and alarming, such as vomiting bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, hoarseness, fainting, fever, bulging eyes, redness of them, and similar signs in various conditions, there is no doubt that they will not be healed. And if you see signs that do not frighten you, and you hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
That is, if the wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded, and that is in the winter days, then it is necessary for you to strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every condition.
And if it is in the summer days, then you must hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest what is under the bone from the membrane be corrupted and those signs that we have mentioned occur.
But if the bone fracture has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and it is with fragments and attraction, then you must cut away the crushed and attracted part, as I will tell you.  ///
And this is how you shave the head of the wounded person and expose the bone in whatever way possible for you according to the shape of the wound and what is lightest on the patient.
If it happens to you during bone detection that there is bleeding or a hot abscess, then use what is necessary against it. And it is as if you fill the place with cloth soaked in wine and rose oil, and make the wound rest until the abscess subsides, and be secure from bleeding. Then begin the treatment of the bone and its removal.
And this is done according to one of two methods.
One method is to cut the bone with a scalpel of narrow blade, and this is its form.
Then administer another scalpel after the narrower one, slightly wider; and this is its form.
Then also administer a third scalpel wider than the second.
And the second method is that you have a number of different scalpels, some broader than others and some shorter than others; and they should be sharp at their ends and made of Indian steel or forged iron; and use skill in striking over the scalpel so that it does not shake your hand and injure you.  />
But if the bone is hard and strong, then it is necessary that you bore around its circumference before you administer scalpels with drills called non-penetrating drills; and they are not so named except because they do not penetrate through the thickness of the fleshy part to what is behind it, on account of the fact that the extremity of the drill above that which is under its sharp head is like a small circle, similar to a rim, and it prevents sinking and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
And it is appropriate for you to take from these drills a great number whose every one suits the thickness of the bone until you have for every skull a drill; and its sharp extremity's length and breadth should be according to the thickness of that skull.
And this is the form of three types of Terebrae, or Trephines.
The quality of perforation around the broken bone is such that you place the Trephine on the bone and roll it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been penetrated. Then change the Trephine to another place and put it between all the holes a quantity equal to the thickness of the radius or about that.
Then cut with the Chisels what is between all the holes from the bone; and make it thinner than you can on that to the limit of thinness, as we said, until you extract the bone, either by hand or with some other of the various instruments which you have prepared for this purpose, such as tweezers and fine forceps.
And it is necessary that you be very careful that the Trephine or Chisel does not touch anything of the brain.
Therefore, when you surround the bone by perforating and have separated it from the brain, if it was continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and smooth the end of what remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the Chisel. However, it must be thin and more delicate than the other Chisels.
But if there remains anything from the small bones and splinters; then take it easily with one of the instruments that you have with you. Then treat the wound afterwards with the linen bandages and ointments which we have mentioned.
And another method of the operation is very easy and far from fear, which Galen spoke of and praised greatly; and this is his statement. First of all, it is necessary for you to begin to uncover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is more severe and evident; until when you have uncovered that part and placed under it the end of this lenticular Chisel, which has this form.
And the lentiform part does not cut anything; and its sharp part on both sides of it goes along the length, as you see: so that the lentiform part is pressed against the sphenoid bone, with its sharp part cutting into the bone.
Then strike the incisor from one side with a small hammer until you cut through the entire bone easily, as it is turned: and you should be confident from the cloth that no accident will happen to you which you fear completely.
And if the doctor were not more foolish or ignorant of this, and were not asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it away with the end of the lenticular part of the incisor itself, and would free it easily. For it is freed from it without harm and without fear.
And if the bone fracture does not penetrate to the cloth, and that which is cut away from the bone is its surface, and there remain in it roughness and fine splinters: then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness, and to remove those splinters with fine rasps, of which you have prepared a number of various sizes, so that it may be possible for you to apply from them what is most suitable and straightest according to the operation being performed and the broken bone itself and its shape. And you should apply [the rasps] in order, first with the wider rasp, then with the narrower ones. Then use a finer one after that.
And you should apply [the rasps] in order, first with the wider rasp, then with the narrower ones. Then use a finer one after that. And do not stop doing this continuously until you reach using the thinnest and finest of all.
But in every small crack or fine fracture that remains, care should be taken according to what leads to its correction.  />
And it is a thing that is not hidden from everyone who has any interest in this art, and it stands on what we have written and demonstrated in major fractures.
But if the flap remains attached when you remove the bone: then it is necessary to take a linen cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil, and place it on the wound's opening. Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth; and make that as easy to do as possible, so that the siphac is not too heavy.
Then apply a broad bandage over it; and do not tighten it except to the extent that holds only the wound; and leave it with this care for one day or two days, until you are sure from hot suppuration. Then loosen it and apply afterwards the medicines with which there is excessive dryness, such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar ones: and it is that you make from these medicines a powder, which powders on the wound like dry things.  />
And generally apply to it every medicine of which the property is that it cleanses and does not sting. And be careful, according to your skill, that the wound in your care is clean: and there is no grease of the ointment, nor any filthiness.
And be careful, according to your skill, that the wound in your care is clean: and there is no grease of the ointment, nor any filthiness. Nor allow any pus to gather on it at all; for when pus gathers on the brain flap, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and a great mischief befalls the patient afterwards: and this happens with the siphac of the head, especially when its care is neglected, with blackness on its surface.
Consider then if these accidents befall the sick person; know that it is undoubtedly fatal.
And if the blackening does not occur except from the medicine placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to produce that blackening; then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and anoint a cloth with them. Then place it on the wound; afterwards care for it with suitable treatments until it heals.
¶ On the Restoration of the Nose when Broken
Know that the nose is not broken except in its two upper parts together or one of them; for this reason, because it consists of two bones: since its lower part is cartilage, it does not break, and nothing happens to it except abrasion, twisting, and flattening.
If one of its two parts is broken, then you should insert a small finger into the nostril and straighten that fracture with your index finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape; and this should be done skillfully and easily. And take care that pain does not occur to the patient due to your procedure.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger does not reach it; then you should straighten it with a rod's end that has a small thickness.
If however the fracture is in both parts, then do likewise with it; and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible. And if not, then after seven or ten days during the quiet of a warm hematoma.
Then insert a wick of linen cloth into the nostril if the fracture is in one part; or insert two wicks if the fracture is in both parts; and let there be in the wick a thickness that fills the nostril's opening.
And some of the ancient surgeons said that liniments should be mixed with butter and changed every day. But this seems not to be the case, rather one should mix the liniment with the membrane of an egg and prepare it with flour dust. Then let the liniment sit until the bone hardens and the cartilage becomes firm.
And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of the liniment, after a soft cloth has been wrapped around it: and this holds the broken nose more firmly in place, allowing the patient to breathe without obstruction.
And this is not necessary. If you wish, do that; and if you wish, make liniments.
But if a hot abscess occurs again while you are treating the nose, apply plasters to the nose with ketone or cotton soaked in rose oil or a small amount of aquiline.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then one should apply plasters made with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg membrane. Then place a soft rag on top of it, and do not bind the nose at all.
But if the bones of a small broken or shattered nose are fractured, it is necessary to cut and remove them with instruments suitable for that purpose.  () Then suture the wound and treat it with that which promotes healing and consolidation using suitable plasters or ointments for that purpose.  ()  ()
But if a wound occurs between the nostrils, it should be treated with liniments, and a lead tube should be administered until it heals.
§ On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: first observe whether the fracture is only on the outside and does not break into two parts, bending towards the inside; then its recognition is easy.  ()
It is therefore necessary that if there is a break in the right side, you should insert the left index finger into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the break is on the left side, then you should insert the right index finger: and push with it the swelling of the break from within easily towards the outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone properly, and make it even with that.
If the jaw is already broken into two parts, then it is necessary to administer traction from both parts according to the straight line until equalization becomes possible.
However, if there has already been displacement or breakage of the teeth, then you should tie those that you hope will remain in place with a thread of gold, silver, or silk. Then place a bandage on the broken jaw. Then place on it a doubled cloth and on the cloth a large neatly made pad or an equal piece of sole skin, along the length of the jaw.
Then bind it securely above, according to the way its ligature is prepared and its application agrees, until it does not become undone. And instruct the patient to be at rest and in peace, and give him soft foods to eat.
However, if you think that something is changing the shape in any way, then hurry and release it on the third day. Then correct what has been altered from that, and apply a plaster of powdered chalk with the membrane of an egg or with sesame flour, after you have removed the bandage: and place on the plaster soft wool.
While that attached plaster remains on it and the arrangement of the bone is not altered, leave it unbound, do not release it, until it heals; or bind the break. For often this break is bound in three weeks.
If a hot abscess happens to occur, then administer that which we have often mentioned for its soothing, until the abscess is removed.
And if there is a break with a wound, take note. For if already a fragment has separated from the bone, either of itself or by your effort: then take care to remove those fragments with what is suitable for you among the instruments used for their removal.
But if the wound's opening is narrow, then enlarge it with a fleam according to your need.
Then, after you have removed those fragments and none of them remain, whether the wound's opening is large or not: apply to it one of the plasters that are suitable for it, and let it heal until it is cured.
¶ On the restoration of the collarbone when it is broken.
The collarbone is most often broken from the front part towards the arm, and its break occurs in one of three ways. 》
Either it breaks and separates into two parts, besides any fragments that may occur within it: and this is easier to restore.
Or such that fragments occur within the bone: and this is more difficult to restore. 》 》 》 》
Or such that there is a break with a wound.
And the operation for it, when the break is without a wound, is as follows: make two assistants present, so that one holds support against the broken collarbone, and the other stretches the neck towards that side. 》 》 》 》
Then straighten the break with your fingers until its shape is correct as it should be: and let there not be any prominence or depression in it. 》 》 》 》
If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place under the patient's neck a pad of cloth or wool: and let its size be according to your need: and extend and raise the collarbone, and squeeze the pad with your hand until you straighten the break as it should be. 》 》 》 》 》 》
If you cannot pull the end of the collarbone to the outside because it has reached deep inside, then the sick person must be laid on their back with a medium-sized pillow under their shoulder, and an assistant should press down on the shoulder until the end of the collarbone that is deep inside rises up. Then straighten the fracture and make it even with your fingers.
If, however, you feel a splinter from the collarbone and it moves, then you should probe for it and remove that splinter easily.
If it is retained in the bone, then you should make an incision over it with one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this purpose. After placing under the collarbone the tool that preserves the splinter, and this tool is made of wood or iron. And this is its form.
It resembles a spoon without a bowl.
And let its width be according to what you need for the size and thinness of the bone. Its length should also be as much as is possible for the procedure.
And it should have two ends, as you see: one end should be wide and the other narrow.
If the tear of the wound that you cut when you removed the bone splinter is wide and free from pus: then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches.
And if the tear is small or you fear hot pus: then fill the wound with cloths and little cushions according to the size of the tear in the wound.
If hot pus occurs, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on the wound.
A narrowing of the bone that is without a wound and without a cut: you should place on the bone an emplaster made from flour and egg white. And place soft wool over it. Then put a ball under its clitoris if you need to. Then take a piece of linen, that is, the one that the Saracens use, which should be very long, and its width should be one palm or about that. Then place two layers of soft wool over the wool and plaster. Then take a small board from a thin tablet, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.  /> Then wrap it in cloth. Then wrap that cloth with the board in the place of the bandage that falls over the break and place.  /> Then place the bandage over the break as it is rolled up, and wrap it around its neck, and under its healthy clitoris, and under its broken clitoris; and bring it back over all parts, so that you see that the tightness holds the break tightly: and this is not hidden from you, so that the board does not move away from the mouth of the break.  />  />  />  /> And for this reason it is necessary to examine the patient every day. Therefore, whenever the bandage softens and you see that the board has already moved away, then straighten it and tighten the bandage.  />  />  />  />  />  />
Then place the patient's pillow on his back, and place under his clitoris near his pillow a small bolster at night, so that it will lift his support from his side. Thus the break of the collarbone is healed by lifting the arm.
Or tie his arm to his neck; and do not untie the bandage unless an accident occurs in that place from itching or from a boil, up to twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if you see its face turned towards it. And for the narrowing, and let it go until it is restored and clotted.
And indeed the break of the collarbone is bound and strengthened most especially on the twenty-eighth day, and sometimes it happens in some men on a lesser one.
About the restoration of the fracture of the scapula.
The scapula is rarely broken and only in its broad part; from it nothing breaks except its edges.
When therefore a place is broken from it, and it breaks in its middle, and it is not known except by touch, then according to what is the figure of the fracture attempt its preparation. And reduce it into its natural form in every way possible for you.
Then put on the place powder of pounding with egg white, and soft tow, and put a little bit of doubled cloth on top. Then put on it a wide splint made from thin board according to the size of the entire scapula or somewhat larger than that.
If however there is any hollow under the splint in some place of the scapula, then even out that hollow with soft tow until the splint descends according to equality.
Then bandage it on top with a long binding of decent tightness and the firmness of the splint, until it is not removed from its place. >()
And examine the bandage every day. Whenever therefore the bandage is softened, bind it again and even out the splint if it has moved from its place; and let the patient lie on his sound side.
And indeed the scapula is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five days.
When therefore this number is completed, then loosen the bandage; and you should be secure. For it is of bones whose comminution is not to be feared nor their dissolution.
If, however, it comes from a piece of bone and pierces under the skin, then cut open above it, and remove it. And do as we said in the case of a broken collarbone from an inflamed abscess, if anything happens from it.
¶ On the restoration of a rib fracture.
The chest sometimes breaks in the middle and this happens rarely. Its extremities are more often broken and crushed by its accidents.
When its middle is broken and it leans toward the lower part, a severe pain occurs and difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps it vomits blood, and a depression is indicated on the broken bone, which does not escape notice. The restoration of it is to place the patient on his back and put pillows under his shoulder blades.
Then press his shoulders and gather the ribs together from both sides with your hands: and straighten it in its place, as much as possible and is suitable, until the shape of the bone returns as needed. 》
Then place a plaster and wool on it, and put a board made of thin willow or poplar wood, or similar light woods, on top after you wrap it in cloth. Then secure it by tying it on the broken bone so that it does not move: and go around with the bandage following the curvature of the back several times and bind it firmly. 》 》
Then examine the bandage every hour and whenever it loosens, tighten it: and if its necessity requires its removal due to itching, or corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess, then hasten and remove it, and take off the plaster, and correct what has happened with the method of its treatment. 》 》 》 》
Then apply a poultice, if you see a swelling there; and attach a bandage to it until it heals.
¶ On the Restoration of Ribs When They Are Broken
Know that the fracture of ribs occurs only in thick places which follow the spine and from their extremities toward the front part. And wear does not occur to them except because they are cartilaginous. And its detection is not hidden from the touch by investigation with fingers. ➤
And its restoration is performed by making the fracture even with fingers to the greatest extent possible until it matches the shape as required. Then apply a poultice and bind the broken bone with a splint if it needs that.
And if the fracture of ribs is slanted toward the interior, then a severe pain and sharpness occurs to the patient, similar to that which occurs to one who has pleurisy; because the bone pierces the membrane, and there also occurs difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood: and this is difficult to cure. ➤
And the ancients have already invented many ways for this; and among them are those who say that one should give food to the patient which causes inflammation and flatulence so that the stomach is inflamed, and extended, and the fracture is pushed toward the exterior. ➤ ➤ ⟩
But we disapprove of this lest a quick cause be made for creating a hot abscess if it does not occur. If however it has already occurred, then it increases it. ➤ ⟩ ⟩
And some of them have said: a poultice should be placed on the place, then sucked out with strength, and this is similar to reason. However, one must fear that the poultice draws superfluities to the place because of the weakness of the patient. ➤ ⟩ ⟩
"And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool that has already been soaked in hot oil; and small pieces of cloth are placed between the ribs, until it is filled, so that when the bandage is wrapped around it according to its roundness, the bandage will be even.
"Then let the patient be treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
"But if a strong force constricts the patient and he cannot bear it, and his breath is pierced by a sharp sting, and we fear for the patient, then we must cut open the site and expose the broken rib. "Then we place upon it an instrument which preserves the sutures, whose description has already been given; and we cut the opening easily, and make the incision.
"Then we unite the two lips of the wound with a stitch if it is large; and we treat it with plasters until it heals.
"But if a hot abscess forms in the meantime, then hasten and soak small pieces of cloth in rose oil, and place them on the site; and let the patient be treated with what is suitable for the abscess.
"Meanwhile, he should also lie on his side where it hurts until it heals.
"Chapter: On the restoration of a fracture of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
"A fracture of the bones of the neck sometimes happens, but attrition rarely occurs to them; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back. "So when this happens to someone, and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then consider carefully. "For if you see his hands already paralyzed, numb, and lifeless; and he cannot move them or extend them or contract them; and when you try to contract them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it and does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in many cases it is fatal.
If it moves them and feels constriction with the fingers and pricking sensation: then know that the back of the bone is sound, and that the patient will heal with treatment.
If it occurs similar to the spondylitis of the back and you wish to know if it will heal or not, then consider the feet. If you see that they have become soft and what happened in the hands has occurred in them as well; and when he lies on his back, flatulence and defecation occur without volition; and when he turns over onto his stomach, defecation occurs without volition; and if, when lying on his back, he wishes to urinate but cannot, then know that it is mortal. Therefore, do not labor over his treatment.
But if nothing of that occurs to him, the condition is less severe.
And the treatment for what happens to him is that you should try to reduce the swelling of the warm inflammation: so that you place on the vertebra finely ground rose oil alone, or with softened egg yolks.
Place that on it several times a day until the warm swelling is reduced; then place one of the strengthening and drying plasters over it and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to use rest and tranquility. And let him not sleep on the side where he finds pain until he is healed.
But if it occurs at the bone fracture or anything else that has already separated from it; then you must cut into the skin and remove it. Then join together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitches. Then treat him with some healing ointment until he is healed.
But if the last bone of the tail is broken: then you must insert your left thumb into the anus and straighten the fractured bone with your other hand as best you can, and follow with a second straightening.
Then place it on top of the wound and remove it; and treat the wound with the previous treatment until it heals.
The restoration of the ankle.
Chapter Eleven.
The bones of the ankles are rarely broken. If they are broken, then the break is not complete but rather a comminution at their extremities; and they split along their length, inclining towards the interior; and it happens that there is pain in the spot, with a puncture; and the leg that breaks becomes numb.
And its restoration is to place your hand upon it, until you stand over the break, so that you may observe its shape.
If the break is only at its extremities, then make it equal, according to what has been prepared for you from the equation, until it resembles its natural shape.
But if the break is along its length or already inclining towards the interior, then make the patient lie on his back until you are prepared to restore that break. When you have made it equal, place a plaster on it; then place on it a splint of wood or leather; and bind it with a binding that does not allow the displacement of the break nor the dislodgement of the splint.
And fill the concavity of the bones with something that will fill it, until the bandage takes hold of it according to its equality; and instruct the patient to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
But if he has a hot abscess, then cease from extending it and its restoration until the hot abscess settles; and place upon it that which will settle it, according to what precedes; then return to his restoration; and bind it as is necessary.
But if it happens in the bone of a joint, or if it is comminuted, remove it.
On the restoration of a broken rib.
The adiutorium is that which is between the elbow and the head of the spatula.
If it should break, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
One of which is that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness in the following shape.
And two bands are fastened at both ends.
Then it is suspended from a high place, and the patient sits on a seat. Then he throws his broken arm over the wood until it reaches the sensitive part of the break where the middle curve of the wood is attached.
Then something heavy is hung from above so that the assistant pulls downwards.  := The physician then straightens the break with his hands at the same time until it returns to its proper place.
The second method is that the patient lies on his back with his head hanging down, and his arm is suspended from his neck by a bandage. Then you instruct two assistants to hold one above the break with his hands and the other below it, each pulling towards himself.
If you wish for a stronger extension, then bind below the break with one bandage and above it with another; and each of the two assistants pulls towards himself.  :=
If the break is near the end of the arm, then a bandage should be placed below the sensitive part and another below the break towards the elbow.  := >:
Similarly, if the break is near the elbow, then a bandage should be placed on that spot and another on the elbow itself.
Then straighten the break with ease and without effort until it is set as needed and has been treated properly; then bind it if there is no hot swelling.
If a hot abscess occurs, then release the stricture until the seventh day. And place on it wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the abscess quiets down; then bind it. And the way to bind it is that you should place a poultice on the fracture.
Then put a bandage of new cloth over the poultice. Then bind the arm to itself, and let him place his open hand on his shoulder.
And place a cloth and bind it over the bandaged arm, so that the arm stands in place of crutches; if nothing prevents you from doing this, then nothing will be displaced in the broken bone.
But if you fear that something may be displaced in the broken bone, then use crutches; and it is, as you should place on the break itself a crutch which is wider and stronger than the other crutches. And place between every crutch a width of one finger; and let the length of the crutches be according to the break with an addition of three fingers on each side.  />
Then bind over the crutches the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is that your bandage should be tighter on the place of the break. And the more the break extends, let the bandage be smaller.  /> cdot Quia si erit longa, pertimebis ne quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid: sed si erit brevis et tenera, non timere debes ne quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid.
Therefore, if you see the position of the crutches and the bandage as we have said, at the hour in which you restore the limb immediately, then do this; and if you fear a hot abscess, then release the bandage and the crutches until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then consider the bandage for three days, so that itching, swelling, or food being prevented from reaching the limb because of the accumulation of the bandage does not happen in the place. Correct that whole thing as we said.
But if it is on the basis of trust, so that nothing happens from it: then do not release the bandage until after three days, or more.
And let the patient sleep on his back, and let his hand be on his belly; and put under him a bed filled with wool evenly.
And watch every hour of the night or day so that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or the bandage becomes soft. Correct that whole thing with your strength.
And give the patient food according to the order we mentioned first, so that the food be fine at first until his mouth begins to tighten; then you must thicken his food.
For it is the custom of the bandage and the leg to tighten within forty days; therefore, it is necessary that it be released then and a bath administered, and treated with ointments that correct that.
But if the fracture is ugly and crushed; then do not remove from it the bandage and splints until fifty days, or even two months.
¶ About the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two humeri.
Of these, one is small and it follows the thumb. And the other is large, and that is the one placed under the small bone on the lower side.
Therefore, perhaps only the larger humerus breaks, or perhaps the smaller; and perhaps they break together. ›
When therefore the smaller humerus breaks higher up, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when it breaks lower down, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult. › ›
And it is worse when two bones are broken simultaneously.
If therefore the bone that is broken is slightly higher than usual, it is suitable for the physician, when restoring it, to place a slight extension with ease, until it becomes level.
But if the bone that is broken is large; then it is necessary that he place a very strong bandage.
And it is necessary that he place the hand mold during its restoration, and the extended extension on top of the cushion. And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint be lower than all the fingers or the rest; and let the patient sit erect on himself, and let the cushion be before him or directly opposite, at a height so that the patient does not undergo labor.  />  />
Then let the assistant extend the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage. And another assistant should extend it similarly from above.  />  />  />
Then let the physician make the bone level until he returns it to the best shape that he can.
If there are splinters in the bone fracture, then strive to reduce every fragment to its place with your skill.  />  />  />  />  />  />
But if there appears a separate splinter that pricks the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it; then find it, and remove it according to the method that we have said concerning those things which are premised.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a special chapter on that, therefore receive its treatment from there.
But if a hot abscess happens at the beginning of your restoration, then line a cloth with an ointment made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be of medium thickness between thick and thin; and bind the cloth over it with a fine bandage, until the abscess subsides; then remove the ointment, and apply a prepared plaster made from millstone powder with egg white.  />  />  />  />  />  /> Then place splints, and let the splint that is placed over the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in various arrangements: whether the fracture is in one joint or in two joints at once.
Then place your bandage over the fracture site more strongly and firmly, and somewhat more so with the bandage above or below the fracture: or place a softer bandage than the bandage itself for a little while, according to how its preceding mention began at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wound over the fracture be soft, moist; and not hard or rough. And let the thread by which it is bound be made of linen, medium between fine and coarse, as we have said.
And consider the limb and its ligaments after days. If something happens for which a correction is necessary, such as an itch that occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to soak the limb in warm water until that itching ceases, and leave the limb unbound until it ceases; then repeat the bandaging.
But if the bandage has already been softened and the bone has already set and similar things: then correct that whole thing with your strength, and examine it again.
For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to an excess of bandaging, then it is necessary that you soften it a little and leave it alone for several days until nourishment reaches it; then bind it again.
But if none of the things that I have mentioned happen to the patient, then it is not necessary to loosen the bandage unless after twenty days or around this time.
Then let the hand of the patient be suspended from his neck. And its neck should be even and it should be protected by its strength from disturbing movements. And make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days. All of this depends on the complexions and dispositions of strength.
¶ On the restoration of hand fractures
Know that in the bones of the hand and in the knuckles of the fingers, a fracture occurs rarely. 》 And it does not happen to them except from much rubbing. 》
When therefore a fracture or attrition of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the sick person sit firmly; and before him let there be a seat according to his equality. 》 》 》 》 Then place his hand on top of it, stretched out.
Then let the attendant straighten the broken bones, and may the physician make them even until they join together with a good union. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Then it is necessary that he place a plaster and wool, if a hot abscess does not occur. 》 Then place a splint on top according to the size of the place; and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth. 》 》
But if the fracture is below towards the sole of the foot, then make something similar to a sphere from cloth; and instruct the sick person to press on top of it with his broken sole; then let it be bound with a long cloth.
And let the splint be made of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather adheres to the body of the sole; and bind it as is necessary.
But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary that you place a splint on top and another splint from below at the sole; and let the hand be open and straight. 》 Then place the bandage as if turning a hand: and stretch it between the fingers with a ligature.
If there is a break in any of the finger joints, then if it is the thumb, it should be set right as necessary. Then bind it with a bandage: and if you wish, place on it a small straight splint so that the break may be lifted up and not moved.
But if the break is in any of the other fingers, such as the middle finger, or index, ring or little finger, then it should be set and bound with the healthy finger which follows it; or they can all be bound together according to their sequence: and this is better. Or place on it a small splint, as we said for the thumb.
And consider in your restoration and after the arrangement of a hot poultice: and apply with it what is necessary when something happens from that, according to the account of its occurrence.
¶ On the Restoration of a Hip Fracture
The hipbone is often broken and this becomes obvious to the senses because it turns inward and toward the rear.
And its restoration is done like this: a bandage is placed above the break, and another bandage below the break. And the patient is laid on his face.
Then let the assistant stretch each bandage to its part equally; and this is done when the break is in the middle of the bone.
But if the break is near the hip joint, then let one bandage be to the pubic region so that its extension goes upward; and another bandage below the break.
And similarly if the break is near the knee, then let one bandage be near the knee so that its extension goes downward. ›
Then the physician should set the bone with both his hands until he brings it back into the likeness of its natural shape; and joins the bone in a good union. › ›
Then you should apply a plaster and bandage if there is no abscess in the limb. If an abscess occurs in it, then leave it for a few days until the hot abscess settles, and then return to your treatment.
And its bandage should be like this. You should wrap over the fracture a thick bandage, that is, a bind; and fold it two or three times, so that there remains some extra length from it. Then wrap the leg until it reaches the heel at the base of the big toe.
And introduce a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee on the inner side, so that the ends of the thread come out from the upper parts of both sides. Then wrap over the leg and hip what remains extra from the bandage.
Then place on the hip at the site of the fracture itself two sticks, and place from them one stick over the end of the leg.  \\
Then fill the spaces between the leg and the hip with soft cloths so that the bandage is even.
Then begin with strong bandaging from the middle over the site of the fracture with three or four turns. And the more you extend with the bandage from the site of the fracture, let your bandaging be less and softer, and gentler.
Then attend to the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the hip and leg. Therefore tie three sticks with both ends above.  \\ Then go with the two ends of the thread to the lower part until you reach the heel of the foot. And with both tie also the ends of the sticks from the other side, so that the bandage is not displaced from its place.
Then leave the bandage on it while it remains in place, so that there is no corruption of the limb, nor abscess, nor swelling, and similar things. "If something happens from it. "Therefore hasten to dissolve it and correct the whole of what happened from it, as we have said many times.
"But if there is a fragment of bone that is causing pain: then it must be evened out, if possible. "And if not, smoothen over it and remove it; and take care of the preceding as mentioned until it heals.
"And sometimes this hip fracture is set, besides which splints are added to it, as we have said in the case of the thigh and arm.
"However, when this type of fracture is reset, lameness does not occur to the weakened individual. "And if it is reset alone, without being attached to the other leg, then it is necessary that he who has it will always limp.
"And know that the hip is set in fifty days, or too little or too much is added; all of this depends on the diversity of constitutions and other dispositions.
"About the resetting of a broken kneecap.
"Know that the kneecap is rarely broken, but it is often subject to attrition.
"If a break does occur, then only either a crack or a hole in its parts. "And this occurs with and without a wound. "And it heals completely with sensitivity.
"Its resetting is thus: that which has been broken from its parts is made even with the fingers, until it comes together and joins as possible by making even and facilitating the construction."  />
"Then place a poultice of sesame flour or milled grain with egg white on it; and if needed, place a round splint on top and bind it tightly above with a suitable bandage.
Then consider all the conditions that we have described for other fractures, such as a hot abscess and similar things. Use what is appropriate to counter each incident until it heals.
On the restoration of a thigh fracture.
Know that the thigh has two bones; one is thick and is called the femur, and the other is thin and is called the patella.
And it happens to both types of fracture that happen to the two bones of the arm; and because of this, its restoration is done equally and the procedure is the same as for the arm.
If both bones are broken at the same time, the thigh will turn in all directions.
And if the thin bone is broken, the thigh will turn towards the front.
And if the thick bone is broken, you will find it lower down; and this is one of those things that are not hidden from you. ・
Then apply traction, realignment, and ligament tying according to the same method as described earlier.
However, if the thigh fracture is a foul break with many bone fragments, the traction should be less and more gently applied than in other cases. ・ ・
And in the case of the thigh, there is something additional in the procedure compared to the arm. When you have realigned the bone ends and completed all your work, then take two splints made from pine wood used for constructing sunshades that are placed under tiles, and they come from the palms of leaves; choose those with a small thickness and not too thin, and let their length be according to the length of the thigh from the knee downwards. ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・
Then wrap each splint with two layers of cloth along its length. And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other part on the opposite side: and they should be from the knee down to below the foot.
Then bind two bands in three places from both ends and the middle. For when constriction is prevented, the leg deviates to the right and left, and stands firmly in place.
And now let a cradle be prepared from wood according to the length of the leg, and the leg should be placed in it so that it may preserve the leg from movement.
And indeed, it is most important that you do this in a fracture when there is also a proper wound with it.
Then examine the leg every day, and be diligent to avoid any swelling, inflammation, or other problems. If, therefore, any of these things occur, then apply what is necessary until it heals, if God wills it.
On the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes. ">
Indeed, a fracture does not happen to the heel at all.
However, a fracture sometimes happens to the bones of the foot and toes, but it does not occur except by attrition in many ways. ">  />
If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see those bones raised above each other, then let the patient place his foot on prepared earth as if he were walking.
Then stand and place your foot on that which is raised among those bones; afterwards press or step on it: and make it level until it returns to its proper place.  />
Then apply a poultice and wool on top; and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two flat ends.
Then bind it with the foot with a decent bandage after you have wrapped it with cloth and other things it may need.
When three days or four have passed for him, then loosen the bandage. For you will find that the bones are equalized, whether they be broken or dislocated. The procedure is thus as you see.
But if some fingers are broken, then set them right and equalize them according to what I have told you regarding the setting of the hand's fingers. Then place the splint according to the length of the finger, and make it slightly wider. After that, place this board under the foot which I have told you about, and bind it with a fitting bandage.
But if the bones that are broken are two or three or more, then place a splint of its size on each finger, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board to the lower foot: and let it stand on one end of the board outside the stomach of the foot, so that it may hold well. 》
And it is fitting for you not to forget that you consider everything which I have said to you regarding other breaks from the accidents which we have mentioned, and apply all of this to every accident as necessary.
¶ On the break of a woman's vulva, and the pubic bone, and a man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is broken, then make her sit with her thighs spread apart. Then incline her slightly towards her back, and let her be held from behind.
Then the midwife should fill her vulva with cotton until it is full; and let this be done in the vulva as if making a sphere.
Then let the woman be shaken, and gradually raise up her back. For that cotton will exit, until it comes out at the entrance of the vulva like a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Then place a little wool on its back. And when it wishes to urinate, let it remove the catheter with ease, then urinate; and put it back according to the way you first inserted it; then return to its first wool.
Let him do that for seven days, or about that time, because the urethra is healed.
And if you wish, take the bladder of a sheep, and tie a reed over its opening, and insert the whole bladder into his vulva. Then blow into the reed with force, until the bladder is inflated inside the vulva, for the fracture returns to its place.
Then it will be filled with a catheter, and let it remain for several days, as we have said, until it is healed.
And when the urethra of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and equilibrium that which we have said concerning the bone of an Anchorite.
And in these nearby fractures that touch only a little, especially for one who has some interest or use, the anus is not hidden.  />
And understand this book of mine well, because the fracture itself shows you in many cases the correct way for its own restoration and tightening; therefore, understand it.
But when a man's penis is broken, take the throat of a goose and insert the penis into it.  />  /> Then wrap a bandage of cloth around it and let it remain for three days, or about that time, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ Concerning the restoration of a bone fracture when there is a wound.
It is appropriate for someone who has experienced a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone or thigh bone, or something similar to them, that you hasten and bleed him immediately: if the conditions of bloodletting are shown to you, as we have said before.  />  />  />  />  />
If the wound bleeds, you should hasten to cut it, and powdered zegi should be applied onto it; if no other remedy is available to you.
Then begin restoring the fracture on that same day, and do not delay it unless an abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess settles. And do not approach it on the third and fourth days, for you would cause bad things to happen to him.
But if the broken bone is prominent and visible on the skin, then you should try to reduce it and equalize it with your hands, with little force and extension.
But if its extension and equalization by hand are not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument. And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is seven or eight fingerbreadths, and its width is according to the size of the wound. And for this reason it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them according to what is needed for that treatment in every kind of fracture.  />
And let it be round; and let there be a slight thickness in it, so that it does not bend during the operation, and let it have a sharp point at its end, with an edge on its ends. And let its upper part be thick from half of it to its lower part.
And this is its shape.
It is necessary in this operation that the sharp curved end of it be placed on the prominent end of the bone, and push it with one stroke until the bone returns and is equalized by some equality.  />  />
Therefore try to equalize the ends of the fracture together.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grasp it well, then you should cut the end of that bone until the instrument can hold it.
If you cannot reduce them with what we have described, then cut him with the appropriate scalpel from those which we have mentioned, or saw him with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
Then scrape away any roughness and small bone fragments remaining on the bone.
When the bone is reduced and the patient experiences severe pain after its reduction, you should know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Do this then. For you confer a great benefit on the patient when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Then soak the cloth in strong, black wine.  /> And properly, if it is summer. Do not place a greasy cloth, or anything with oil, on the wound, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption therein.
Then give astels at the end of your restoration of the bone. And leave the wound open; do this by cutting a hole with scissors in the bandages according to the size of the wound.
And take care not to bind the wound with the fracture. For many times have foolish doctors done this and caused either death or corruption or pus, that is, purulent discharge, to befall their patients.  />  And let your bandage be soft and gentle, different from the binding of other fractures.
But if the wound is bad or large and you fear that some of the harmful outcomes we have mentioned may happen, and you find pain in the area, then it is not proper to place astels on it.  /> And make bandages from hard cloths in the place of astels and bind the wound with them.  
But when it is the first or second day and you see that the wound begins to generate pus, then remove from it the cloth which you placed on it with wine. Then administer liniments and ointments which we commonly use to treat wounds, such as the tetrapharmacum ointment, and similar ones.
And it is suitable for you to loosen the bandage. And examine the wound each morning and evening until it heals and consolidates.
And it is necessary that the member be prepared in such a way that the pus runs downwards easily from it.
If many days pass and the wound does not heal nor does the pus burst from it, then know that there are small fragments of bone within it. Therefore, it is necessary to probe the wound with a probe. However many of those fragments are separated, remove them and extract them. And those which are not separated and pierce the member, causing pain, endeavor to cut them out and remove them by any means possible for you.
If the wound becomes inflamed or forms a carbuncle, that is, an estiomenos, or another sign of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary to apply to each of these what is suitable for them from the treatment, whose preceding description is in its own chapter.
And from this, it is necessary that my speech stands and to which you direct your attention when a bone is broken and protrudes over the member, such as the hip bone or thigh bone, and similar ones among the large members, it is that you should not attempt to reduce it, for death often results from this; rather, leave it alone until it becomes putrid.  />
For perhaps it will fall by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if it seems necessary to you; otherwise, leave it alone.
About the treatment of swelling at the site of a fracture.
This swelling often occurs as a result of healing a broken bone. Especially if it is near the joints, and the limb becomes deformed because of this shape. And perhaps it prevents the limb from functioning naturally.
Therefore, if the swelling is recent, apply to it remedies that have an astringent effect, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, dragon's blood, and acacia, and similar ones.
In this way, take some or all of these and prepare them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and place them on the swelling in wool, and bind them tightly over it with a good bandage.
And leave the bandage in place, and do not remove it for many days. Then remove it, and apply another one, until the swelling is removed. xspace
Or bind a lead sheet over it securely. For lead has the property of removing anything that is feared from the limbs.
But if the swelling has already turned into a hard lump, and is tightly bound and pressing urgently to be removed, then make an incision over it from above, and cut off the protruding excess; or shave it with some razors, until it is removed; and care for it until it heals.
¶ On the treatment when the limb is restored but remains thin and not in accordance with its natural state.
When a bone fracture is restored but the limb remains thin and weak afterwards, this happens only for many reasons. One of these reasons is the frequent loosening and re-tying of the bandage, not as it should be; or because of excessive tightness of the bandages, so that the nourishment cannot reach the limb; or because of an excess of ointments applied at the wrong time; or because of a lack of blood in the infirm body and its weakness.  />
And the treatment is to feed the patient and make their body soft until blood increases in them. And apply a poultice. And pour joy and happiness over him.
Then place pitch on the member, so that it draws much nourishment to it. And continually use an infusion of warm water on it, until the nourishment runs, and it returns to its natural form.
¶ On the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly.
When a member that has already been restored after its healing is crooked or protruding from the fractured bone or knotted, and its form is disfigured, yet the member does not prevent its natural operation, then you should not accept the advice of one who thinks that the member should be broken again.
And indeed there have been many foolish physicians and restorers who have done this in our land.
And this operation is very blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, as if it were fatal.
However, if the limping and knottedness are recent, then it is necessary that an infusion be made with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as mullein leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar herbs. And for him make a poultice with softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon.
Or let the mucilage of the root of mullein be taken and shaken with chicken fat or sesame oil, and he should be poulticed with it.
Or let figs be taken, ground with pigeon dung and similar substances that are called in the medicine books as "consolidation reducers".
And sometimes the knottedness is dissolved with constant, old, and gentle friction, which is done with wet hands. And let motion be given to the limb towards every part at all hours.
But if the twisted part has already preceded and has become hardened and turned into a bone, and the necessity for its treatment with iron has arisen; then it is necessary to cut above it, and free the continuity of the bone, and cut off what is in excess from the knotting or the bone with fine incisions: and let facility be given in that with care and diligence.
About speech in dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper place. Therefore, it is prevented from its own motion and the shape of the limb is marred. And it causes severe pains and injuries to come upon the weakened area.
Therefore, when someone experiences a dislocation, it is necessary to hasten towards its restoration; do not delay it at all.
For if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation as well.
Because of this, it is not necessary to move it or extend it during the hour of its inflammation. › Since it often causes spasms and piercing pains to occur.
But when this happens, then it is necessary to hasten towards the bloodletting of the sick person. Then let it be released until the inflammation subsides.
Then the limb should be rubbed with warm water and oil. Then it should be reduced with ease.
And all of the limb should be scraped along with it when it returns to its proper place.
I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, even following as it preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body to its lower parts.
About the care of the dislocation of the lower jaw. › › › ›
**The two jaws are rarely dislocated.**
**And the dislocation of both happens in one of two ways.** **For either they are moved from their places by a small removal and soften slightly** **Or they are dislocated completely until they soften at the chest, so that the sick person's saliva runs and cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue rolls with speech.**
**But when the dislocation is slight, then it returns on its own in most cases.**
**But if the dislocation is complete, then it is necessary to administer its reduction quickly and not at all delay: and it is that the attendant holds the head of the sick person, and the physician introduces the thumb of one hand between his teeth if the dislocation is on one side.** **Or he introduces both thumbs at once if the dislocation is from both sides.** **And the other fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he balances.**
**And tell the patient to clean his jaws and return them to their original state of biting.** **And the physician balances the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.**
**If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are affected together, then apply a fomentation with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy; do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.**
**When they return and are balanced, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place small pieces of cloth soaked in wax and rose oil on them.**
**Then it should be bound gently with soft bandages.** xspace
And let the patient's sleep be on his back: and his head should be supported between two pillows, so that he does not move to the right or left; neither should he attempt or be forced to chew anything; rather, let his food be given as a gentle drink until the pains are removed, and then the jaw should be tied. Then he may eat whatever he wants, and it should be administered easily.
He shall not strain himself with the movement of his mouth for eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is tied and healed.
But if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some point and do not return to their proper places, then fevers and persistent swelling often occur from this, and perhaps the patient's bowels are loosened, and perhaps pure bile is vomited.
Therefore, when you see this happen, know that it is fatal, and the patient often dies within ten days.
¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the end of the upper arm.
The collarbone indeed does not dislocate from within the ribs because of its connection with the chest. And it sometimes dislocates to the outside and is evident by sensation.
The treatment for this is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. Then firmly grasp the place with your hand, for it will return on its own.
Then apply a plaster and pillows to it, and bind it.
However, the ends of the bone that follow the elbow and are continuous with it do not dislocate, except rarely. But if it does dislocate on some day, then it must be reduced and set as we have said and as you have been prepared for.
Then place upon it a plaster, and small pills, and a bandage. And instruct the patient to remain calm and still until healed.
And with this same treatment the dislocation of the shoulder is reduced when it has also been separated from its place.
§ On the reduction of shoulder dislocation.
Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways.
One of which is that it may be dislocated downwards to the armpit. The second way is that it may be dislocated towards the chest. 》 And perhaps it may be dislocated to the upper part of the shoulder; and this occurs rarely.
And it does not dislocate towards the back, due to the blade (of the scapula). And it does not dislocate forwards, because of the nerves.
Most often it dislocates and exits downwards towards the armpit; especially in those whose flesh is scant. Because it exits quickly in them and re-enters quickly. 》 ⟩ ⟩
But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of this, that is, because it exits with difficulty and re-enters with difficulty. 》 ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
And it happens to some people that a blow or fall occurs and the shoulder swells up with a hot swelling, and it is thought because of this that it has already been dislocated. 》 ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
Therefore, you should examine it until you stand on certainty about it, and then proceed with its treatment. 》 ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
And a dislocation is recognized when it is downwards towards the armpit; and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one. For you will find between them a clear difference, and you will find in the head of the shoulder a hollow, and beneath the armpit where you feel the head of the shoulder it is as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all its motions. 》 ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you will find a clear touch, and it will not be hidden.
And in fact, this dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent, or if the child is weak.
And its reduction is that the assistant should lift his hand upward. Then place your thumbs under the joint, and lift the joint with strength upward to its place: and the assistant should lift his hand, and extend it upwards. Then he should place it below, for it quickly returns by itself.
But if it does not return through that which we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation first occurred: then it is necessary that the sick person should bathe in hot water, and a poultice should be administered which softens and soothes, such as when hollyhock roots, fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and this is applied.
Then the sick person should be placed on their back: and under the joint there should be placed a ball and wool, which should be of equal measure between softness and tightness.
Then the physician should place his heel on the ball, and lift the head of the humerus with strength, and draw the patient's hand downward.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is that you should have present a man who is taller than the patient, and he should stand at the side of the patient, and insert his humerus under the joint of the patient; and he should lift the joint upward until the patient hangs in the air. And another assistant should draw the patient's hand downward to his belly. But if the patient is light; then it is necessary that something else should be suspended with him, so that he becomes heavy; for the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is also reduced in another manner: and that is, as if a long stick is fixed in the ground, with its head being round like the handle of a mortar, which should not be too thick nor too thin. Then let soft cloths be placed under the patient after he has been positioned on top of the stick's head, and the patient should stand along the length of the stick.
Then his hand is extended downward on one side, and his body is extended strongly on the other side, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
But if his reduction is difficult by all the means mentioned above, then use this method: and that is, take a stick whose length is equal to the size of two arms, and its width the size of four fingers, and its thickness the size of two fingers. Its head should be round, so that it can easily enter deep into the armpit, in this manner.
Then let soft cloths be tied over the round head, so that the stick does not hurt the patient.
Then let it be placed under the patient's armpit, so that his hand or arm may be extended over the stick down to the bottom; and let the stick be tied to a support, and the arm and the tip of the hand.
Then let the arm be placed on the step of a ladder by its width, and the hand be extended downward, and let the rest of the body hang freely on the other side. For the joint will go back immediately.
Therefore, when its entry is completed in whatever manner possible, it is necessary to place under the armpit a sphere of equal size made from wool. Then place a prepared plaster made from powdered flour with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder as it is wrapped around.
Then tie a decent bandage under the armpit, and let the band be rolled over the plaster on top; and let his hand be bound to his neck, and do not move his hand for seven days.
And it is necessary that food be given sparingly to the sick person until the wound heals, because it heals more quickly.
Then let a larger amount of food be given after seven or five days, and let it be taken with movement. If it becomes firm and does not soften, then it is already healed.
If, however, the joint is frequently dislocated, either because of the moisture that affects it or for another reason, then it is necessary to administer a cautery with three holes in it, as was mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery.
But if all this is done and the ligament is dissolved after seven days and the joint does not become firm and the plaster and bandage are removed from it several times and it does not become firm but falls and cannot be raised again, then know that the nerves connected to the head of the shoulder have already been cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never remain in its place.
But dislocation that occurs towards the chest and breast or towards the back is reduced with pushing and stretching by hand until it returns; then let the remaining plaster and care be administered to it until it heals.
But if heaviness and slowness of movement occur in the limb after healing, then let the patient use the bath frequently until that heaviness is alleviated and returns to its original condition.
¶ On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty, and it can be dislocated in all directions, especially towards the front or back.
And its dislocation will not be hidden from you, because it is obvious to sight and touch in whatever form it may be dislocated. And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clearly shown to you. For the junction will be noticeable and the arm cannot be bent double nor can it touch its own shoulder.
And you must hasten to reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot swelling occurs.
For if a hot swelling occurs, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is towards the back. For this is the worst of all types of dislocations and causes them the most intense pain; and death often follows it.
And its restoration when it is possible to reduce it is that the patient's hand should be stretched out with two hands; and his arm should be extended, and the physician's hands should be above the elbow and below it, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of both his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place. 》
Or if the dislocation is towards the front, then it returns thus: that he bends his hand with his own hand until he strikes the dislocated elbow with the root of his palm.
But if the dislocation does not obey reduction, then apply strong and very violent extension; and it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and two other assistants should hold him also, so that he may not move during the extension.
Then the arm should be turned to every side after a long folded cloth or broad bandage has been wound around his hand.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil; so that this may be one of those things which aid the lubricity of the joint with ease. Then he should push the joint with a violent thrust until it returns.
And after its reduction, a plaster should be placed on it, containing styptic and drying properties with egg white, and bound with a decent bandage. And let the arm be suspended from the neck of the patient; and leave it for some days.
Then let it be released. If then the joint is firmly established in its place, release the bandage from it and leave it alone.
And if you see that the joint is not well fastened, then repeat the application of the poultice and the bandage, and leave it alone for some days, until it is fastened. Then release it.
But if after the reduction of the joint it becomes heavy and is in motion; then administer a moistening bath, a subtle friction, and a compression until it is straightened, or place on the joint iliati, that is, the fatty tail of a ram. Then let it be bound, and leave it on night and day. Then remove it, and have the patient enter a bath. When he sweats, then gently rub the joint with a moderate friction. Then repeat the application of iliati three times: when entering the bath the first time, and the second, and the third, until it is relieved.
And if you wish, place on it warm, moist cow dung mixed with butter, and bandage over it.
Do this several times. For it is soothed, and returns to its proper condition.
§ On the treatment of dislocation according to Albucasis.
The wrist is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
And its reduction is easy. Unlike other joints. However, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of this dislocation within the hour it occurs, before swelling sets in; or a hot inflammation arises in it.
And the reduction of this dislocation is accomplished by placing the affected hand on a table, with an assistant stretching out the patient's hand; and the physician places his palm over the protruding joint, and pushes until it returns to its place. ➤
Indeed, it is necessary to consider whether the palm has already receded to the belly of the hand: then the sick person should place the back of his hand on the board for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is proceeding toward the back of the hand, then let his hand be placed intrinsically on the board, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the board, so that the hand of the physician may fall onto the very prominence of the joint.
Therefore, if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster to reduce the swelling, and leave it alone, do not irritate it.
For if he does not tolerate it, and you cannot reduce it after the days have passed, although the joint remains in its twisted state, and it causes no harm to the patient except that the hand becomes soft and cannot grasp anything, then know that the nerves are severed or damaged.
Therefore, there is no skill in it except to cauterize it near its site. And perhaps it does not help at all.
When the Almahassem does not return, then apply to it the plaster that I have described. Then let it be bound and left for five days; afterward, let it be unbound and left, and the hand should be exercised.
However, if its movement is impaired and something heavy happens to it, then soothe it with warm water and frequent rubbing until it is soothed.
¶ On the Treatment of Dislocated Fingers.
When a finger is dislocated in any direction, whether the finger is dislocated toward the back of the palm or its belly, then extend the finger and press on the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger and hang it toward the side to which it is dislocated for two days.
Then suspend him and stretch him until he is straight on that day.
When it is night, bind him according to the aforementioned account: and do not cease to release him during the day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him at night.
Do that for several days until it is tightened.
And do likewise with him if his hand is dislocated towards the abdomen: and bind it to that part, and perform your first treatment on him until he is healed.
And do likewise with him when he is dislocated in other parts.
¶ On the treatment of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae.
When the vertebrae of the back or neck are completely dislocated or many vertebrae are displaced from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death hastens to the invalid.
And the sign of it is that the invalid's bowels come out involuntarily and he cannot hold them in, and often some of his limbs become paralyzed, or both of his legs, or both of his arms, or one of them, or a single vertebra is displaced from its place. 
For often it happens that their removal occurs in four parts.
Therefore, that which is removed to the back is called "humpbackedness.
Its cure is that you should consider then, if the humpbackedness occurred from childhood: then there is no cure for it, and there is absolutely no healing from it.   
But in that which occurs from an accident or blow, or similar things, the ancients have already spoken at length about methods of cure. Of which very little is accomplished with benefit.
But I have already abbreviated from that, and pardon me for saying this about the multitude of it from its propinquity to my intention and explanation which I have explained and formed an instrument in a different way than they showed and demonstrated it.
I say therefore that in the case of a hump which occurs from the front, there is no skill and no cure from it.
And similarly in those which occur on both sides as well.
And they are not cured by this, except for those which occur on the back itself, as I describe: and it is that the patient is laid down on his face on a level platform near the wall; and under him wet straw is spread out, so that his chest is not harmed.
Then a straight stick is fixed in a hole in the ground at the end of the platform near his head; and another stick near his feet at the other end of the platform; and an assistant holds the stick, not firmly fixed in the hole.  /> And another assistant holds the other one.  />
Then roll up above the patient's head and under his chin a soft but strong bandage; and extend the end of the bandage to the stick that is by his head; and tie it there.
Then bind another bandage above his ankles, and above his knees, and around his calves. Then gather all the bandages together and tie them to the other stick that is by his feet.  />  />
Then let each assistant extend their bandage towards the stick, and do not move the two sticks from their places where they are fixed; however, they should not be firmly attached, as we have said.
And the physician places his hands on the vertebrae with strength, until it returns; or he places a board on top of it. Then he connects his feet to the board until it returns.
But if it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arm's lengths.  /> And make an opening in the wall near which we said the patient is located, into which the end of the board can enter. Then place the midpoint of the board over the vertebra. And let the physician place his feet on the other end. And he should pull firmly until the vertebra is compressed, and then return to his position.
Then, if you wish, work with a lathe that can be turned by hand: and there is, as you should fix into the ground at the head of the patient, on the last step of the platform, two pieces of wood, each of them the length of one arm; and at his head, on the last step of the platform, two more pieces of wood.  />
And let the distance between each piece of wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in every place where the lathe runs; and let all the pieces of wood be firmly fixed in the ground, so that they do not move at all.
And a round piece of wood is inserted; and this is the lathe on which the band is turned in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its end is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is one palm with what is being turned; and on the two other pieces of wood it is likewise.
Then tighten the bands that you have tightened on the patient's chest with the lathe that is at his head; and the bands that you have tightened on his legs with the lathe that is at his feet.
Then let an assistant stand by each lathe, who turns the handle with which the lathe is turned; and the physician should adjust the vertebra as we have said.  />  />
This is the form of the lathe that follows.
Then, after the vertebra has returned to its place and the position is adjusted, it is necessary to place a drying plaster with egg white. Then wool. Afterwards, place on the plaster a board of three fingers' width, or about that. And its length should be sufficient to cover the swelling and extend onto the healthy part of the spleen.
Then it is tied with the ligament we mentioned. And the patient should use a fine diet until healed.
If any swelling remains at the end of the healing process, then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medications along with the tablet we mentioned for a long time. And now a lead sheet is applied there.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the last vertebra of the spine; it is believed to be a dislocation, and the bone that has already emerged is called an exostosis. Therefore, it should not be assumed to be treated with this medication; perhaps it will cause death.
§ On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the shoulder do not undergo anything but dislocation; nothing happens to them as it does to other joints due to a slight separation and shallowness.
The ankle joint is dislocated in four parts. That is, because it is dislocated forward and backward.  /> In the case of a forward dislocation, you should bind the foot to the leg with one bandage in such a way that the ankle joint is pulled back by its edge and stays there.  /> Then place two splints on either side, binding them together with another bandage.
And it is dislocated most often to the inside; less frequently to the front and back.
And the treatment for its dislocation to the inside is this: when you join the healthy leg of the patient with the unhealthy one, the unhealthy one is longer; and its knee protrudes more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot double his foot at the groin; and the place following the groin is swollen with a warm swelling because the head of the thigh bone has already arrived there.  /> You should bind the healthy leg to the unhealthy one in such a way that you pull the unhealthy one back until it matches the healthy one in length; then apply splints on both sides and bind them together with another bandage, so that neither can move from its place.  /> Then take some lead plates or other metal and make two small discs from them. Place these discs between the swollen place and the groin, binding them together with a fourth bandage.  /> Afterwards, apply the plaster we mentioned earlier; and have the patient use a fine diet until healed.
And the sign of that which has been dislocated outward is that its accidents are contrary to these accidents.
And the sign of that which has been dislocated forward is that it stretches the healthy leg fully: however, without pain in the knee; and if it tries to walk, it cannot step onto its toe; and its urine retention occurs, and a swelling appears in its groin, and during walking there is pressure on its heel.
And the sign of that which has been dislocated backward is that it does not extend the knee, nor can it double itself before doubling the groin; and its leg is even shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and there is a protuberance at the site of the hip bone.
The reduction, however, of these types of dislocations is such that you should consider, at that time, if the dislocation is old, which has already become chronic in the patient. Then, if you administer its reduction and it remains in its original state, then there is no cure for it at all. Therefore, one should not make a presumption about it at all.
However, in the case where the dislocation is recent and is from one of the four types of dislocations, then hasten to do this: roll the joint, extend it toward the inside and outside, and move it right and left; for perhaps it will return, and no other treatment will be needed.
If it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong helper; and let him stretch the leg from below: either with his hands or with a ligament, which is tied above the knee on the leg; and another helper should extend his hand from above, so that he introduces his hands under its armpits. Then let him bind it with a soft ligament over the base of the hip, and let him hold the end of the other ligament.
And let its extension be either from the front part of the groin to the collarbone or from the back part to the spine.
And let all these be done at once so that the patient is lifted with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
And this type of extension is one of four common types.
Therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then for each type I will say something about its specific treatment.
For the proper reduction of it when the dislocation is toward the inside, it is necessary that the patient be rolled over onto his healthy side. Then he should place a bandage on the hip joint, between the head of the thigh bone and the place under the groin. Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the collarbone.  />
Then another strong assistant should take his arms and reduce the prominent part of the dislocated hip with a vigorous outward extension. Now it has returned to its place.  />  />  />
And this type is easier than the other types of treatment for reducing this limb.
But if it is pushed outward and does not obey you at all with this type of treatment, then it is necessary to bind both feet of the patient together with a strong, soft bandage over the two heels and the two knees, and let each bandage be four finger-widths in length from its fellow. And let the infirm leg be extended by more than half of two finger-widths.  />
Then let the patient be suspended over the top of a beam in the house, and let its length from the ground be that of two arms.  />  />  />  />  />  />
Then command a strong youth to hold the head of the thigh bone, and let another youth be suspended with the patient; and let another youth push, holding the thigh bone strongly, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
When there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary for the patient to lie on a bench, as we have described for those with a hump. And let the bandage be tied around his leg and chest.
Then let two wooden sticks be placed: one at his feet, and the other at his head. Then let an additional stick be placed in the middle of the bench, securely fastened. Let it be wrapped with damp cloths so that it does not harm the patient, and let it be between his thighs so that he is not drawn downwards when extended.
Then let each assistant pull on their respective part, and the physician should balance the reduction with his hand.
If it then submits to being returned (to its place), it will be good.
And if not, place a board on top of it and press it down evenly, as we said for a hump. However, the patient should lie on his sound side.
And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary for the patient's leg to be extended quickly; and this account applies similarly on a bench; and the physician should place his right hand over the patient's groin. Then let him squeeze with the other hand, and with that squeezing place the (leg) extended downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is to the back, then it should not be necessary for the patient to be extended downwards; rather, he should be raised up off the ground. Indeed, it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, as is also appropriate if his ankle is dislocated outwards, according to what we said about lying on two ankles: and it is face-up with the bandages extended, as we recently stated. (){0}
And a bandage with a board should also be applied to the place from which the joint is dislocated when the reduction is completed as necessary.
And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: It is that you extend the two legs of the patient and when you see them equal, and the patient draws up his leg and extends it without hesitation, then know that the limb has already returned as it should; then join the two hips and place a bandage, and bind with emplastrum, that is, a wheel, so that the ankle does not move towards any part; and let the patient rest quietly for three or four days.
Then loose the binding and bandage, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in position, know that the dislocation is now healed; therefore release the patient to walk.
And if you see any swelling, then return and bandage it again, and bind it according to your first binding; and leave it also for three days.
Then loose it and let the patient walk slowly on both legs for some days until it heals well.
About dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways. It is dislocated to the outer side, to the inner side, and to the lower side, that is, to the back.
And it is not dislocated to the front.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to apply his leg to his hip.  /// If it does not stick to the hip, then know that the knee is dislocated.
And the reduction of all kinds of its dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright so that he extends his leg over it if he can, and let your back stick to his face; and put his foot between your feet.
Then make the knee stick with your palms, and place them straight between your fingers on the knee.  ///  ///  /// Then apply both sides of his knee with your palm strongly. And another assistant should extend the foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of reduction is that the leg adheres gently to the hip, not forcefully.
Then bandage it, and make the leg adhere to the hip. Then bind them together with a band for three days or four. Then release them.
And the patient should not walk for some days until he is cured.
But if the reduction is refused, then apply strong traction with bands as described earlier for the treatment of ankylosis until it returns.
§ On the treatment of dislocation of the heel.
The heel is sometimes displaced by a slight separation and sometimes completely dislocated. And its dislocation occurs either towards the inside or the outside. ›
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and protruding towards the side to which it has dislocated.
The treatment of its slight separation is easy reduction: and that is to stretch it gently with the hands until it returns to its place.
But the treatment of its complete dislocation is as follows: make the patient sit upright, and have a strong assistant hold him firmly from behind his back, in the middle of it. › › › › › › ›
Then hold the foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below in the place of the heel.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › "Then with the left hand two times.
"Then extend with the left hand and press the top of the foot with the right hand towards the leg without difficulty.
"Do that twice, as we have described.
"Then press the top of the foot towards the leg a third time, and you draw out the thread.
"If then it returns once or twice according to this method, and you see the foot even, it is good; and if not, then repeat the procedure on him, for he will return.
"However, if its reduction is prevented from you according to what we have described, then make the sick person lie on their back on the ground, and drive a peg into the ground firmly so that it falls between his thighs; and now you wrap a cloth around him so that the sick person is not harmed.
"Then let the assistant take his thigh; afterwards the assistant should stretch out the other foot, either with his own hands or with a band that binds around the ankle of the foot. "Then let every assistant stretch in the opposite direction to their counterpart; and a peg should stand between the two thighs of the sick person, holding him so that his body is not drawn downward during the stretching.
"Then let the doctor equalize the dislocation with his hands, and the other assistant should hold the healthy leg downward. "For the dislocation returns quickly.
"When the dislocation returns and its soundness is clear to you, then place a poultice and wool on it, and bind it securely with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
"And it is necessary that you be cautious or afraid of the nerves that are above the posterior heel, so that there is not a bandage over them that is too strong and injures them.
"Then let him go for two days, or three. If the ligament is softened, tie it; then untie it on the third or fourth day, and prevent the patient from walking for forty days. If however he tries to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not dissolve over him and become corrupted, and that it will not afterwards receive healing.
If a hot abscess occurs to him, then you should administer for its relief that which we have previously described in another place for treatment, and an embrocation, until it is removed.
Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment.
It is necessary that what is dislocated among them be set right with only a little extension and without difficulty; indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
If however the dislocation is in certain nodes of the back of the foot, then it is necessary that the patient sit with his foot on a level surface or on a board, and stand as if walking.
Then you should stand and place your foot over that which protrudes from those joints. 》 Then press it firmly with your foot until it returns and you see that it is already set right, and no prominence appears in the place.
Then place under his foot a board that fits the entire foot, which has two handles. Then bind it with a decent bandage for three days. 》 》 》 Then unbind it and make him rest from walking many days until he is bound and secured from relapse.
Concerning the kinds of dislocations with a wound or a fracture.
When such a thing happens and you seek to treat it and restore it, death often occurs; and for this reason one should not presume to undertake the treatment of such a case unless he is skilled in the art, long-practiced, merciful, pious, slow, not rash or presumptuous; and he should use at the beginning only those medicines that quiet hot abscesses, and leave the patient to divine judgment. 》 》 》 》 》 If you see or hope for health to be saved from ruin with gentleness of illness, and in which some hope appears. Therefore, strive immediately at the beginning of the matter for its reduction before a hot abscess occurs.
If therefore the limb returns as we wish, then administer a remedy that settles the abscess, and treat the wound with an appropriate drying ointment.
But if the dislocation is with fracture, and separate pieces of bone occur, then strive for their removal, and do as we said earlier in simple illnesses about what should be done in those places.
And beware according to your strength, and guard yourself from entering the way of fear, as my earlier preaching to you said.
For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and safer for your body among them in your time.
