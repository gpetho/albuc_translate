Chapter Twenty.
On cauterizing teeth and loose gums.
If the gums are loose because of moisture, and the teeth are loose, and you have treated them with medications and they have not been effective, then place the patient's head in your lap. Then heat the cautery, whose image comes after this, after placing the tube on the tooth.
And insert the heated cautery quickly, and hold your hand for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth. Then lift your hand. Then repeat the cautery as many times as you want. Then the patient should fill his mouth with salt water.
And he should hold it for a while and then spit it out. The loose teeth will become firm, and the loose gums will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry.
