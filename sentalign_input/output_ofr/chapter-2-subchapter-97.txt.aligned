Leeches are not used with fire except on limbs where one cannot place cups because of their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and other similar; and the way to use them is that when you find leeches that are in clear fresh water without impurity, take them; and put them for a night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and have nothing in their bellies; and then be bled by vein or by cup, then rub the limb until it is red, and place the leeches on; and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where one can put a cup, put it there, for it is very beneficial afterwards. If not, wash the place with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then squeeze it; and if the place bleeds too much after the leeches' bodies, wet a linen cloth in cold water, and put it on, until the blood is stanched; and if the blood is profuse, apply ground vitriol, or gallnuts, and similar things, until it is stanched; or you put on the place halves of peeled beans, and leave them until they stick to the place, it will stop immediately; and if you need more, take other leeches.	Then you leave them in fresh water for a day and a night until they are hungry and nothing is left in their bellies; then you purge the patient's body, either by venesection or by the application of cupping vessels; then you scrub the afflicted part until it is flushed; and then place the leeches on it. When they are full they will fall off. If it is possible to make suction with a cupping vessel, the effect will be greater. But if not, wash the part with vinegar followed by much water; then rub and put pressure on it.	0.8213274
And if the leeches do not want to attach, rub the place with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until the blood comes out, and then put them on, and as soon as they smell the blood, they will attach; and when you see that they are about to fall off, sprinkle on a little aloe and crushed salt, or ash, they will fall off immediately.	If the leeches fail to stick on, the place should be wiped over with fresh blood or pricked with a needle to bring out a little blood; then apply them, for if they smell any blood they will immediately adhere. When you wish to remove them, sprinkle over them a little powdered aloes or salt or ashes, then they will at once fall away.	0.89430964
