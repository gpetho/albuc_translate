Of the fractured thigh
The thigh bone is often fractured, and it is easily seen when it turns forward and backward; and the restoration is such that a bandage is tied above the fracture, and another below.
And the patient lies on their back, then each assistant stretches their part evenly; and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is near the root of the thigh, then one of the bandages should be near the groin, and the other below the fracture. And similarly, if it is near the knee, then the bandage should be near the knee, and the extension below; then the physician sets the bone evenly with his two hands, until it is in its natural shape, and then applies the poultice, and binds it, if no hot abscess forms.
And if there is a hot abscess, then let it settle, then return to your work and care; the binding is done in this way.
You should wrap over the fracture a hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the root of the buttock, and put a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and the ends of the thread come above; then turn the bandage over the leg and the thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the bone of the leg; then fill the space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloth to make the binding even, then start binding firmly three or four times over the fracture; and the further you go from the fracture, the less you bind; then address the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and the thigh, and tie three splints above, then go down to the end of the thread, until you reach the foot; and bind it, so that it does not move from its place, then leave it so, provided that no abscess or swelling or anything similar occurs.
And if it does occur, then unbind it, and adjust what occurs, as we have said many times; and if there are pieces of bone that pierce, they should be removed, if possible; and if it is not possible, then the area should be cut, and the pieces extracted; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is fractured so that splints are placed, as in the shoulder and arm; however, with the restoration done this way, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, depending on the diversity of complexions.
