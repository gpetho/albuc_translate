About the fat of the eyes
Exinach is a fat that forms in the tissues of the upper eyelids, and this happens more in children than in adults, and it greatly troubles their eyes, and they get catarrh in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because the tears rush to their eyes; and because of this they lie on their faces often, and sleep on their faces, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist and the swelling and appearance are covered with exinach that appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the exinach in between.
And the manner of the procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap; then take a small linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the amount that the exinach contains from each part, then place it on it; and press with your fingers from one side to another, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle; then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a cut of the width, and it should not be larger than the wound made for bleeding a vein; and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in many cases, exinach comes out from the cut, in the form of a piece of white fat.
Then extract it with a piece of cloth placed between your fingers on the outside, and turn your hand to the right and left until it is expelled; and be careful not to press in the cut, so that you do not come with the spatula to the eye, and injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the cut, then increase the cut slightly until it appears; then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind with bandages.
And there are such men who grind salt and place it on to corrupt that moisture that remains. Then treat it until it is healed. And if a hot abscess comes to the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
