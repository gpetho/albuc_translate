Any that are dislocated must be straightened by means of gentle extension, without violence; that is not hard but positively easy.	The dislocated toe must be aligned with gentle extension without strain, which is not difficult but rather easy.	0.80466527
If the dislocation be in one of the joints of the dorsum of the foot, the patient must set his foot on level ground or upon a board, standing as though walking.	If the dislocation is in one of the joints of the top of the foot, have the patient place his foot on a flat surface, such as the ground or a board, as though he were standing.	0.8820381
Then you must stand and put your foot on what protrudes of those joints, and put strong pressure upon it with your foot until it goes back and you see that it is evened out and there is no prominence at the place.	Then, stand and place your foot over the protruding part of the joint. Press down with strength until the joint returns to place, and you see it aligned, without protrusion.	0.83889174
Then put under the sole of his foot a flat splint with two heads to take the whole foot, and bind it on with a tight and secure bandage for three days; then loosen it; but keep him from walking for a good many days until it binds and you are sure it will not revert, God willing.	Then place a board beneath his foot that covers the entire sole, with two ends. Then bind it with a moderate binding for three days. Then release it and have him refrain from walking for several days until it strengthens and stabilizes to prevent re-dislocation.	0.88424456
