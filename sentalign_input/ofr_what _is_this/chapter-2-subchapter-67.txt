Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the place opens; and none of the intestines descend into the testicles, and if any descend, it is little, and returns all the time; and yet if it stays too long in this state, the wound or membrane grows, so that the intestines descend; and this happens by the stretching of the membrane which is in the groin, as we have said, for it is stretched, then the place is softened and swollen and opens; and the treatment is by cautery, as we have said before; and sometimes it is treated with an iron instrument in this way: the patient lies on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture widely to the extent of three fingers; and then extract the membrane which is under the skin that perspires, then take the thread and place it over the visible place of the membrane; and press it deep into the belly, then sew the two visible places of the membrane over the end of the thread, and sew both; then pull out the end of the thread, and do not cut the membrane or spread the egg or anything else, as I have told you in the treatment of intestinal hernia; then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
And when you cut the threads, clean it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The membrane is constricted, and has no appearance in the rupture, and the cautery is more moderate in this place, and closer to healing.
