Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed to you, my son, this book, which is the last of medicine's science with its supplement, and having finished in it from its explanations and declarations, it has seemed good to me that I should complete it to you with this treatise, which is part of surgery, namely, with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Because surgery with the hand is laid out in our region and in our time entirely private: until perhaps science of it has died out, and its track has been lost: and there remain from it only a few descriptions in ancient books, which have been changed by hands: and it happened to them error and hesitation, until their intentions were closed, and its vision was extended: It has seemed good to me that I should bring it forth with the order of this treatise in second place according to the order of its position and declaration and abbreviation: and that I should bring it out with shapes of instruments cautery, and the rest of the work's tools: for the sake of adding a declaration, and of specifying what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	Because the cause by which a good artist does not find with his hand in our time: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to exercise himself before it in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the joints of the limbs, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and ligaments, and their numbers, and their emission, and their pulsing, and quietness, and their exit:
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because Hippocrates said, 'The name is much, but the work is little, especially in the art of the hand.'
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Because who does not know that we have spoken about anatomy, he will not be satisfied until he falls into error, in which human beings are formed: as I saw many of them who form themselves from this science and throw themselves on it without knowledge or experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That is, for I saw a dull-witted doctor cut an apoplexy scrofulous in the neck of a woman, and wound some blood vessels in her throat; why the woman's blood flowed until she died between her hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor, who thought to extract a stone from the man's penis, which had been causing him pain for some time; but the stone was great.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he came to him and took it out with a tweezers.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Why the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I too had been called to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the care of the nurse that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor take a fee from our Duke's land for medicine; and there was a black eunuch by him, who was hurt in his thigh near the heel: and the doctor treated it with ignorance, and bound the wound closely to the shin with strong plasters, and did not cease from the pain.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he discharged him according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then after a few days he discharged him, and ordered him not to loosen the bandages; but he stood thus until his leg was withered away, and he himself came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	So I was called to him; and I made an end of loosing the bandages: and there followed peace, and he was free from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	Nevertheless the corruption was now confirmed in the member; and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So the corruption ceased not to walk in the member, until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another doctor who pierced an apoplexy cancerous; and it was sore after days, until the malice of it came out with the lord thereof.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, for when the cancer is pure from the melancholy humour, then it should not be touched with iron at all, unless it be in a member that will bear it, lest it be cut away entirely.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of this, you must know, my sons, that surgery is divided into two parts: namely, the operation which is associated with health and the operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already excited (you) in all places of this book, where surgery comes into existence, in which there is fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Why it is necessary for you to beware of this, and to decline it: so that they may not find a stupid ear to speak and dishonor.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Take then a measure with care and protection, and bring the sick of you with ease and firmness, and to use the better way, leading by the grace of God to salvation and a worthy succession: and take away from you those terrible illnesses which make you afraid, so that they may come upon you a hesitation in your faith and your comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it remains more remaining to our glory, and sublime in the world, and finally to the quantities of you.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Because Galenus has already said in some of his instructions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat disease with medicine: do not call yourself a doctor of ill-health.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	But I have already divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter one: Of the nature and cause of surgery.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On the pre-caution with fire, and caution with sharp medicine, a dressing, and an order from the head to the feet, and forms of instruments, and tools for cauterizing: and everything that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two: Of the order of operations, beginning from the head and going down
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On sectioning and perforating, phlebotomy and venesection, and wounds: and extracting arrows, and similar things: and all the chapter, ordered by forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three: Of cauterization with fire, and sharp medicine, and dressing
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, displacement, and cure of twists, and similar things: chapter ordered from the head to the feet, and forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	I. Of the instruments and implements necessary for surgery
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the use of cauterization and the types of skin layers that should be used, and when to use them, as well as with iron or gold.
Caput I.	I. On the Head:
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But first, let me speak of the qualities of the instruments and implements of surgery, and when they should or should not be used, and what kind of skin to display them on.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I therefore say that the speech about the quality of cauterization is a long, subtle, scientific, and secret speech.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	A multitude of wise men also spoke in it, and they disagreed with each other, and for my part I am satisfied with a little of their speech, fearing to go into detail.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I therefore say that cauterization is universal for all skin types, whether with substance or without it: excepting two skin types, which are a warm and dry skin without substance, and a dry and cold skin without substance.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In a warm and dry skin with substance, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some said that cauterization is useful for such a skin.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	But others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for such a disease, which is caused by heat and dryness, because fire's nature is heat, and it is inappropriate to heal a disease caused by heat and dryness with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite said: "By cauterization, all warm and dry diseases that occur in human bodies are healed, because when you compare a human body to its moisture, it is like fire, and a cold body is not like fire.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself say through his speech, because I have also discovered that through experience.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not necessary to go into detail about that, unless one has already been proven and exercised in the last chapter of the exercise of cauterization, and knows the difference between human skin types, and the nature of diseases within them, and their causes, and the accidents of those diseases, and the time they occur.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Do not fear the remains of cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all the physicians have come together on them; and they do not disagree with Celsus on their treatment.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know ye, O sons, that the secret cure by fire and the goodness of fire on fire is a simple action which does not reach, unless it reaches the member which is cauterized; and it does not harm another member joined with it, except with a slight damage.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	But the fire which is used for the cure reaches that which is drawn out from the members; and it may happen that it produces a difficult cure of sickness in a member, and perhaps it kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire because of its fineness and goodness of its substance does not do that, unless it flows over.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	But now this has become known to us by experimentation because of the length of habit and study with art and station on verity of things; and for the length of speech I excuse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it is not, because it is not allowed for my book, I would give you the secret and hidden thing in fire, and the quality of its action on bodies with its expulsion, which expels sickness by philosophical demonstration, which is gained from the minds of your children; let me say.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know ye, O sons, that they disagree at the time when fire is to be made, and they put forward a better time of year for the wound.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that fire is to be made at any time; because the damage which happens through the time is hidden in the cure, which is attracted with fire.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if fire is made because of the pains from necessary pains, strong pains, feasts which do not bear tardiness; for they fear these things, that evil which is greater than a small damage which does not happen through time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not throw this out of your minds, O sons, that they do not measure it, unless the common and stupid physicians; for that sickness which is cured by fire does not always return: and they put forward its consequence, and it is not like what they say; because fire is not, except in place of medicine, which changes complexion, and dries up humidities which are causes, why pains happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Indeed, the cautery is superfluous above the medicine because of its velocity, the strength of its action, and the power of its effect: and it is possible that the disease may be restored at some time later, following the recovery of the patient's health, and the removal of his illness, and the strength of his body; and that it was prepared in his body from an accumulation of superfluous material within him; and that it reached him in the acquisition of its power from food, and similar causes, unless disease occurred, in which case cautery would be administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Indeed, a slight disease in a small member is superfluous, and moisture, such as the pain of a tooth, because of the pain, and similar things; for it is possible that this pain should not remain in him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that is true of a few things.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the word of the doctor again, that the cautery is last of all medicine, is a straight word: it is not meant for that which they intend in him; for they believe that there is no cure that brings with it when medicine does, nor anything like that after the occasion of the cauterium.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the opposite is true of the doctor; and his intention, that the cautery is last of all medicine, is not so intended: unless when we administer to some disease ways of cure, and those do not confer those medicines: then we shall administer at the end of things a cauterium, and it confers; then it falls that the cautery is last of all medicine, is not intended according to what the common people and many medical men understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But the ancient ones said, "When the cautery is with gold it is better than when it is with iron": and they did not say that unless for the equality of gold, and the limitation of its substance: and they said, "It does not make a place for the cauterium.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely true; for I have tried it, and found that it does not do so in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they have said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	Indeed, when you use fire cautery on gold, it is not declared to you, when lit according to the quantity that you use, due to the redness of gold: and when it comes to the coldness, and if you add ignition on top of it, it melts in the fire and turns into leaves.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Why does the craftsman fall from that in practice: and because of this, cautery with iron is faster and closer to us, straight to the point of operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I myself have already ordered this chapter on cautery, according to the chapters: and I ordered them from the head down to the feet: that you may find what you want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	On the way of cauterizing the tooth in the crown of the mouth.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Here confirm cauterization to the domination of humidity and coldness on the brain: which are two causes of sweat, and a multitude of flux of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and pain of teeth, and pain of throat: and universally all sickness that happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and swelling, epileptic fits, and strokes, and similar things from those illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The way of cauterization is, so that you instruct the sick: that they are discharged in the first place with a solutable medicine and purifying the head after three nights, or four, according to what the power of the disease, and his age, and his custom require.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then order that he make his head radiance with a red-hot iron.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands square, so that he has already put his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your hand on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	So whichever way your middle finger moves, mark that spot with fire.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then the fire cautery: which this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then put the piece of flesh on the marked spot with the caustice, descent, so that your hand constricts it little by little, and you rotate it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then move your hand quickly, and inspect the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	That if you see already extracted from the bone quantity of salt, or quantity of thyme, then move your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat the hand with the iron, or with another from him if it is cold: until you see the bones, which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some of the salt and dissolve it in water, and dip it in the poultice, and place it on the spot: and release it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put over the spot poulticed in butter, and release it on the spot, until the fire scar is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with the ointment four-fold, until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said, that since the splinter remains open longer, it will emit pus: why is it better and more beneficial to the patient.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And said one of them, so that it may be cauterized on the skin until the bone: and hold the fire, until some of the bone's spiciness is burned up.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then burn after that which is burnt out from the bone, then cauterize it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it should be with the fire to reach the last place, until it impresses on the bone an impression of a letter, so that it falls: or instrument which women put into an infusion of alphabet: and they extract, because from this place vapor of head comes out, and the splinter remains open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then cauterize, until it hardens.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But I do not know these two kinds of fire at all unless they are in certain people due to fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to dismiss him, it is better for me with his health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified in the other members; and especially when the head is weak from nature: and, moreover, when the species of the Cautery is first more healthy and better with me, and I use it: so let us work on him while he is healthy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On the mode of cauterizing the head in pain throughout the whole head.
Caput III.	The Head, Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs throughout the whole head, and it is prolonged in one who is sick, and he uses ointments, and poultices, and hot baths, and oils, and employment.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And above all if the cauterization has already been done with one cautery, which we have described, and does not give him anything of those things: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is strong of nature's creation, and is not weak, and there is a cold sensation: then cauterize under it with another cautery a little bit.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize him on all the horns of his head with his own cautery, and don't let the skin be broken, and a quantity of bone be disclosed, which we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize him with one cautery at the back of his head, in the place which is called the spot: and it is a place where there is a breeze; and wipe your hand well in this place, and do not disclose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the weak one has the painful pain due to this spot, and is far from the pain of the other parts of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this cautery in its place; and it must be that which is used to cauterize the horns of the head, and the back of his head with a thinner cautery, so that it cauterizes the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the mode of cauterizing in a headache, as with medicine adjusted, as with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occurs in the skull, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is washed with medicines that clear it, and the remaining treatment is administered as I have described in the division of illnesses, and does not provide all of it: then cauterization should be done in two ways: either cauterization with an acute medicine burning: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But if cauterization is done with an acute medicine burning, it should be as follows: take one of the teeth of a donkey, and scrape off its flesh, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut out the area of pain at the time with a phlebotome's blade, until a place is made under the skin, where the tooth enters.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it into that place under the skin, until it is hidden: then tighten it over that with a constricting bandage and remove it after fifteen times, then wash it out again after two days or three: then put a soaked cloth on that place, until a pus forms: then treat the pus with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to make it with certain medicines that burn, which I have written about in the 12th book, On Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	But cauterization with iron is according to this method:
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Fire Cauterization, whose form is as follows:
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a 'clauis': because the shape of the head is like the shape of a clauis, in which there is a little prominence, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place that on the spot, and hold your hand: and slowly turn the iron with speed: and the amount that burns is determined by the thickness of the skin, such as half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand so that it does not burn the artery that is lower down, and so that no blood flows.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the wound in salt water, and put it on the place, and leave it for three days: then put the wound with butter: afterwards treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if there is a headache, cauterize this headache with extreme care with a scalpel in the second cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And do not cause an incision of the artery in this headache, but it is old and its own.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	The mode of cauterizing in an old headache.
Caput V.	Head.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a headache, in addition to what we have said before in the treatment preceding and because we have said that the division of diseases is not effective, and you see from the disease that it does not suffice to it that we have said from cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire; then it is necessary to put the fire of cauterization until it turns white after the signs on the place of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or almost like that: and then put your hand out one way, and squeeze it until you touch the artery, and reach all the way to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you, so that you cauterize the continuation of the jaw, which moves during chewing, so that it does not burn on one side or the nerve which moves it, from which accident a spasm occurs.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard and take care of the flow of blood of the artery that has been cut off.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For there is a danger in cutting off that part, and especially to him who does not know what he is doing, and is not studious or expert: and he dismisses the operation with it at first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a reminder of the treatment of the flow of blood of an accident from an artery in its own place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	That if you see from the disease that this cauterization does not suffice, and you see the body suffering from the cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have told, treat the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see, apply cauterium, which we said in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two scissors.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better and more effective in this way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	§ On the method of cauterizing with fire in pain in the ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain happens in the ear from cold, and is cured with poultices, and the remaining cure as we said in the division, and the pain does not cease, then apply fire cauterization: and that is what is called a punctum, whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the punctum with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it heals: or around either, if the pain is simultaneous in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And lengthen it with the cautery from the root of the ear slightly, after you have marked the places with encaustic: and let the quantity of cautery be ten points all over the ear, and almost the same.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the place, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	§ On the method of cauterizing with fire in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture which is cured with cauterization, is not unless from the species which happen from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of ailments.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And removed cauterization of the species which happens from drying, and spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with hips, and caputpuruns, and gargarisms, and your cure does not bring about improvement, then you should cauterize the sick with three cauters: one near the root of the ear, and the second a little lower than its place, and the third at the connection of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery from the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not happen unless in the part which appears to be healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is, so that it cauterizes itself with the cautery in the direct extremity of the upper ear near the apex of the head a little bit: and the other in the time: whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And deposit your hand with the cautery, until half-a-handspan of the skin's thickness has been burned away.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the shape of the cautery, and it is made from a scalpel, whose form is mentioned above: verily, however, it is not less sharp by much, as you can see; and the scalpel should be a little less thick than that.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then heal the wound with the cautery which preceded it: until it has healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	The way of cauterizing in ancient apoplexia.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexia is antedated, and care for it has been given with that which we have said, and your treatment does not bring about a cure, and the patient is without fever, then cauterize him four times on every corner of his head, and once in the middle of his head, as we have said, and once at the back of his head, according to what has preceded: and the way of the cautery should be according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also cauterize with the cautery over the mouth of the stomach: and it is more final.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then heal with that which has preceded.

Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that he should drink a great deal of wine in the first illness, and pills which clean the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the whole head, and place over its back an ointment described in the treatise on ointments: and sometimes put it on himself.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is the way of the cautery: and do it according to the order which we have said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If then he is healed by it, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then do to him three cauteries on the back of his head, which descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cautery a thickness of finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then heal the cautery with that which preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If he does not want to wait, and is eager: then make him a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	That if you do not want to add anything: then cauterize him above two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for the wound, until it heals: and anoint the cautery according to the form, which has been said before.

Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you should proceed in the purification of the head with hygeine, and with that which I have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head with a razor: then cauterize it with cautery in the middle of the head, and with cautery over all the horns of the head, and with cautery over the posterior part of it, and with three cauteries over the joints of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if you are not able in health to soften the body with many of these things, and the sick person can tolerate it, and the sickness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries over the joints of the back, and the last one with cautery, until it is burned through the skin very much, and wash your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for the wound, until it heals: and so anoint the cautery.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Then let the purifications of his brain be first with hygeine, and with the rest of the cure which I have said in a division: but if the sick person is very weak, or can tolerate medicinal things.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if he is a boy who cannot tolerate medicines, then let him have gargling, and teeth-cleaning for purifying the brain, before those many days with good alimentation.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of his head, and according to that which has preceded in mode: and with another cautery on the back of his head, and over all the horns of his head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If he is infirm but strong and able to tolerate, then cauterize him with the cauterizations I mentioned in having a paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck, and the vertebrae of the back: and let there be cauterization with olive oil according to the method that preceded.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of secretions that lead to melancholy, and his body is wet and unhealthy, then give him in a drink what will purify his brain, according to what preceded in division: and then shave his head, and afterwards make a tortuous strip made of linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head: and the infirm one, sitting down, should hold himself upright on all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present the liniment.

When you see the first signs of water in the eye, as I have described in the division, then begin to drink, and use an ointment, while he washes his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him away from all moisture, and let him sit in a bath, on a few days' fast.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his scalp.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him over the two temples with two cauterizations, if the first signs of water appear in both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if the first sign appears in only one eye: and cut away all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauterization be long in length through the temples: and let it stop the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and in their cutting off, and in the caution against the flow of blood.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are ancient, constant: and are over the veins, and the arteries that are on the outside of the head, it is proven that it is from the cold excesses, phlegmatic: then cauterize with the same cauterization in the beginning of the descent of water, with a cauterization in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations over the two temples, and two cauterizations in the scalp under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if it does not bear the addition, then cauterize him in all sides, with careful eye, at the end of the eyebrow, with a small cauterization.

Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat this, with the medicine we spoke of in our division, and there is no benefit from the treatment: then approach it and give it three nights of soup for sick-fleshes: then shave its head, and cauterize it with medium cautery, with oil cautery.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if it is red, cauterize it above the two eyebrows with two cauteries all over: and let them be stretched by the two times: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not put your hand on it with the cautery, but second by second according to how much it burns the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of cauterization according to this method of lunar cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	The mode of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are turning into the eye by stinging it.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery is in two ways, with fire or with the medicine burning.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	But in the cautery with fire, prescribe to the sick person beforehand so that he lets go of his hairs, if he is of those who clean them out, until they are lengthened and made even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, it stings him near its origin: then squeeze the eyes with a wet cloth so that they do not move, until they are asleep.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When, however, they have become asleep and even: then place the head of the patient in your lap: then mark on the eyelids of his eyes with encaustrum, a mark that is according to the figure of the leaf of myrrh: and let the beginning of the mark be next to the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then put on the bandage wet with albumen, or with slippery mucus over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then the fire-cauterization whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize on the figure, which you have marked little by little in many places, until it is burnt to the surface of the skin, which is like the figure of a holly leaf, all apparently proper.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of health of your operation is this: that if you squeeze the eyelids of the eye and make the hair disappear at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So then put your hand away: and dismiss these tribes after a few days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then put on the bandage with butter, until the eschar is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any of the hair returns after an hour and softens the eyelid: then again apply the cauterization to that place, as you did before.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	But if the hair is on the lower side: then cauterize that, until it returns to its own place: and equalize so that the hair of the eye does not sting.

Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While he was persevering in this that he found the mordication, then leave medicine, and move it himself with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the mordication has ceased, then remove medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider, if you see the eyelid rise up, as it were, during contraction with fire or during incision, is well: and if not, then repeat over him from medicine on the place where the medicine does not print, and does not disfigure, until your operation has made it even, and closes.

When you care for the fistula, with what regards we have said concerning divisions of illnesses, and your cure does not bring about: then it should be cauterized according to this mode.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Prescribe to the sick person that he puts his head in your lap, and holds it between his hands so that it does not move or shake with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then put on cotton wadding, or musk-sap, over his eye: then apply the cautery, whose shape is thus.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Then cut the wadding, like the shape of a feather from one end, so that it forms the cautery; and if you cut the thread, going through to the other end, and if you stretch it thus.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this wadded string is better for your purpose.

And hold your hand slightly near the cautery from his eye, towards the nose, so that your hand does not move, or shake: and put on the cautery, with the fat of the eye, and soften it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If then you cut the skin at the beginning of your cautery to the mouth, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you can bear it: and dismiss it after three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then put on cotton wadding with butter, and treat the wound with an drying ointment, until it heals.

If, however, he is not healed after forty days, then put on the wound an acute corrosive medicine, until you see the mouth: and read it again according to what comes out in his book.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another way of applying the cautery, which some said first.

Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	Lead, however, burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a wonderful cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	What if the fistula is healed, as we have said from the cautery and cure, is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.

When it has happened that a blister occurs on the root of the gingival tooth, or in the palate, or on the roots of the teeth: then pus is produced, and bursts: afterwards it dries up, and pus flows out, and a fistula forms: then care for it, and the cure is not successful, then you should set fire to the cauldron according to the quantity, which it takes in the fistula.

Then take a cane-like object, whose shape comes after these things, so that you put it over the tooth: and insert the burning caustic quickly into it; and hold your hand there slightly, until the sick one feels the heat of the fire having reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And wash your hand: then repeat the caustic a few times, according to your will.

Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23: Head.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When the toothache is due to coldness, or has coldness within it, or is sore, and does not benefit from remedies: then the caustic is to be applied within it according to two methods: either with butter-caustic: or with fire-caustic.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	But the caustic within it is to be made with butter, so that you take buttermilk and heat it, and boil it inside the ear-piercer or the needle.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cotton swab, and wet it with the fat, and hold it on the tip of the tongue.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then submerge the affected area in the butter that has been heated: and place the area on the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it becomes cold: then repeat the application a few times, until the power of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, immerse the thread, or wrap it in cold butter, and place it on the hurting tooth; and place over it a hot iron, until the fire penetrates deeply into the tooth cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But cauterization with fire is so that you go towards the air pipe or the iron pipe.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And sit in his body some gruel so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the throat.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then hold the cautery, whose shape you have made; and place it on that tooth; and hold your hand, until the cautery cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this sometimes, for the pain is alleviated, or at the same time, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it should be impressed with the cautery so that the sick mouth is filled with good butter and holds it for an hour: then he should spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.

When the Strophulae are inflamed with phlegm, and from cold humidities, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and wish to digest them quickly: then hold a small, hot cautery, whose shape is thus made.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Has two open ends so that the smoke from the cautery's other end is emitted: and place the hot one on the sore once, and again if you tolerate it, until it penetrates deeply into the abcess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	That if the abcess is small: then place the cautery according to the quantity of the abcess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then let it be left for three days, and place over it a hot cloth wrapped in butter, so that the fire which was lit is extinguished.

When there is moisture on the lungs and especially when this is accompanied by a cold complexion, then it is important to remove the sick person's fluids at the outset with dissolved medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize the throat itself with fire at the root of the gum and, if it should happen that you go too deep with the cautery so as to hurt the gums or skin, do not move the cautery there again unless something is present.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize the throat with another cautery at the joint of the neck at the base of the spine and, if it should happen that you go too deep with the cautery so as to hurt the gums or skin, do not move the cautery there again unless something is present.

When a cough and lung disease are caused by cold humidities, and the sick person is not feverish or suffering from phthisis, and the illness is old: then cauterize the throat with two cauteries above the jaw in depressed places, lightly, and gently.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be the same length as that which was before used.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish to mark your cauterization by puncturing with the cautery, which is called a 'point', and which corresponds to the form of that which was before used in puncturing pain in the ears: and let there be points from twenty to almost thirty.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the person who was before treated, until he is well again.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let there be three branches of cautery: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Why the allaying of pain with this cauterization is greater when you make the three branches of cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	The way to cauterize a titillation and dislocation of the shoulder:
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the assistant's head is dislocated due to moisture, and it does not return to its original position at the time of its dislocation until it has become accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a slight movement, which has happened as we have already testified, then you should reduce the dislocation in the first instance.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the sick person should be laid down on his back or on his side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then, with your left hand's index finger, gently press the small bone at the top of the wrist, which is inside and towards the thumb: and if it is dislocated inwardly.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then take two sharp surgical instruments.
Cuius forma est haec.	The shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the flesh until it penetrates to another side, and make the figure of the cauterization with four cauterizations.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And when the cauterization is made with a instrument having three sharp edges, then the figure of the cauterization becomes six smaller cauterizations: and the sharp edges are second only in their fineness to the needle.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	This is the shape of the instrument having three sharp edges.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And when a single addition to this method is made, then there are eight cauterizations.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place over the cauterization crushed herbs with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then do not allow the sick person to move any part of his body for a certain time, until he is comforted.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upward and it rarely happens, then cauterize him on his shoulder with a single sharp instrument, or cauterize him by puncturing with many sharp instruments.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint will be firmated and the moisture will disappear: and the sick person will recover.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	The method for cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and great moisture occur in the stomach, until they have taken the person out from his skin, and multiply to him catarrh until he is cured, and do not make any effort: then the sick person should be laid down on his back, and extend his legs, and stretch his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauterizations, cauterization under the cochlea of the chest in the quantity of one digit with cauterization of the claw, and two cauterizations below the two sides of a cauterization, until the figure of the cauterings becomes tri-angular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen between each other so that they do not join together, when they make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be the quantity of two thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the figure of the cauterization be according to this form without addition: and if you want a large cauterization in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cauterization with which this cauterization is made be one according to the form of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And let the stomach be cauterized by piercing it at the point where it trembles because of this cauterization: and it is, so that you mark a point on the stomach according to the quantity, which you have with the caustics: then cauterize the same with the cautery-pierce: then cure the same with the cure that preceded it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	The way of cauterizing with fire.
Caput XXIX.	Head 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When it happens in the Abdomen that there is pain from cold and humidity, or from thick winds, until it emerges from his natural skin by means of excess discharge, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then let the sick person lie on his back on the chest of the dead, and let three cauterizations be made according to this form, and this quantity be the same over the spar below the hypocondria, where the bed of man reaches: and let there be a space that is between each cautery according to the thickness of the finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body straight: and do not squeeze your hand with the cautery very much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, the half of which is not added: and let the sick person stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If, however, he is not standing, then let him lie down, for he has already stretched out his legs, and lifted up his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the operation.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And you too can do this operation with a knife blade when there is skill and prudence in the art with you.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself that you do not proceed too far in the cauterization, and let the skin be burnt all over, for it is burnt all over the body, and reaches the intestines: since the skin is there thin, so know that one thing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	§ On the method of cauterizing the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens that the apostema [blister] is in the liver, or in its lining: then if it is in the liver, you will see a pain that is gentle and without acute pain, and if it is in the lining of the liver, with a sharp pain: and you will see that the treatment of doctors fatigues it.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary therefore that the sick person should lie down on his back on his own bed.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then form the shape of the blister with encaustic [hot wax], and then light the fire of the cautery so that it is absorbed by the radiation.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with that one cautery until the whole skin is burnt, and reaches the siphac, until it comes out completely: then take care of the cure of the cured things, until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary that this cautery should be used, unless the study of medicine is prolonged in someone: and because sometimes some illnesses come with experience: then let him dare to carry out such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But, however, to dismiss it, with me it is better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	§ On the method of cauterizing in the pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients say that the cautery with roots of arista [aristolochia] is applied to pleurisy in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, to take from the roots of dry aristolochia long, a root which is found in her, and let it be as the thickness of the finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery in him that is between the extension of the fork with the neck, and two small cauteries under the goatee slightly inclined on the side, which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two cauteries also in him, which is between the fifth and sixth ribs slightly inclined towards the back: and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from behind: one in him that is between two spoons: and two cauteries from the sides of the breast, lower cautery which is between two spoons.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary that you should compress your hand with the cautery, but let it be in the open skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient said that out of men who use a cautery of similar iron wire: and light it on fire, and insert it into him that is between the ribs until it reaches with it to its aposteme, and comes out serum: as we have said in the aposteme of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with the cautery there is fear, that either the sickly one dies immediately, or happens to the place of a fistula, which has no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	§ On the way of cauterizing the spleen - Head III.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you cure the sickness of the spleen, when with him that we have said about the division of diseases, and your cure does not benefit him, then cauterize it in her according to three ways, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of which one is, that you make three cauteries, or four lined up according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauterize of the liver, whose predecessor was the figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between every cautery quantity of the thickness of the finger, or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let there be a mode of the incision, which we said in the incision of the liver equal.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the incision: and let the sick man lie on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another mode of incision is: that which has two sides of the fire of the incision, which we said in the chapter of shoulder dislocation: and raise the skin, which is in the straight spleen, where it reaches the bed of the sick on the left side: and let your raise go up according to the breadth of the body, so that the incisions fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two sides of fire strongly, until you penetrate through the skin with them from the other side: then pull out the incision: so there are four incisions.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cut with an incision that has three sides.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care of the incision after you have let it emit pus for many days: because it is more healing as much as remains from the cure has προηγεσθαι.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	The mode of incision in Hydropsis.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The incision does not fall in Hydropsis, unless it is properly raised.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you cure Hydropsis with the methods of treatment which we have said in the division, and there is no cure, then it is necessary that the incision should be made four incisions around the navel, and one incision above the stomach, and one incision above the spleen, and two incisions behind the back between the vertebrae, and one incision in the middle of the chest, and one incision in the middle of the stomach: and let the depth of the incision approach the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then let go of the incision open, so that it emits pus after a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not wet the sick with cure after the incision, for it is necessary that there be two intentions: and will hasten to him the healing with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the incision which is cut with the cutting of the belly, let it be a fold: according to which it preceded in form: and its form which is cut with the cutting of the back, let it be a lip, according to which it preceded in form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	To cauterize the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they have been put out [of the fire] and filled with yellow water: you should cauterize across the back of the foot in the web between the auricular and the annular: and wash your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then wash your hand: and do not touch it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water shall restore it, and the cautery shall remain in this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteriums on the two legs, and let the cautery be made with the tip of a scalpel: and make a cautery according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other lower down by it, about in the middle of the leg: and make two cauteriums on all the hip: and do not close the cauterium for a long time: so that it shall be healed from it some water: then cure yourself with the rest as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	The way to cauterize in solution of the belly.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the belly has been relaxed from cold and moisture, until it weakens the retaining virtues and the digestive ones, which are in the stomach and intestines: and cure it with the methods of curing, and does not heal: and you shall see a weakened one bearing the keen virtue of the cautery, then cauterize him with a large cautery across his belly, following what has gone before in the cauterization of the stomach with a small circle-shaped cautery, and four small cauteriums around the navel, with a small scalpel: and a large cautery above the loins, or two cauteriums.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see abundant moisture, and a weakened one of these things, then cauterize him with a cautery across the chest, and a cautery across all the hips: and perhaps you shall add two small cauteriums on the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	This is indeed a successful cure, whose promise does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	To cauterize hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are of a gross humor, cold, or corrupted humors, and are treated with the same thing that we have said in the division, and does not benefit: then cauterize three cauterizations on the lower spine of the back under an egg-shaped triangle, and a cauterization under the navel almost like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you consider that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see that his face has palor, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what came before: and a cautery on his spleen, and another on his liver, with a clove: and leave the cautery open for some time: and then take care of him, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	The way to cauterize the thrush after cutting it off.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut off the thrush, then light a cautery that is radiated.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the lit one into the thrush that has been cut off: and with your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the anus, from which blood runs: do it once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If then there are many thrushes, then cauterize each one with a second cautery according to what we have said.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them, using the ointment on them until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on his back, it is more painful in the curing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	The way to cauterize the fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.De modo autem quod et in ure
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick one does not obey the section and the work that we have described in its place, and shudders at it, perhaps he will be healed with a cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	For when a fistula has occurred in someone and it is old, pus runs out of it, and there are corrupted wetnesses.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is worthy that you should probe it with subtle attempts when it has occurred.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the quantity of its depth with tentative tests.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply a cauterizing fire, which is like heat.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself with the fire itself into the fistula and measure the quantity in which it enters by its closure.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly apply the fire to it until all the corrupt bodies are burned out; once, or twice, or three times, according to the need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from any burning of the skin, if there is any, or large blisters; or if the fistula opens into the stomach or intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place; and be aware that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the seal remains there and no material is lost from it, and it remains like this for a long time: then know that it has been completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if no material is lost from it, then know that it has broken open, or its opening is in a deep place, or almost like those things: whose memory will remain in its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	As for the method of cauterizing the Renes.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it has occurred in the kidneys a pain from cold, or from gross wind, and they are midnight because of that, then you should cauterize the same above the loin over the kidneys, cauterizing each kidney with a cautery, preceded by a memory.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we have cauterized it again within the same loins.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why do three stripes come?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Thus they will be more in the test.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	As for the method of cauterizing the Vesica (bladder).
Caput XL.	Chapter X.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When there occurs in the bladder weakness, and softening from cold and moisture, until he does not retain urine, then cauterize him on the lower part of the scrotum over the bladder, where the hairs begin to grow together, and cautery from the right side supplied, and another from his left: and let the length of his cauterization be according to the length of the finger-knuckle: and cauterize him with two cauteries if you can bear it. And let it follow, according to what preceded cauterization nail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	As for the method of cauterizing the womb...
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When there occurs in the womb cold and moisture, and it is prevented by that from conception, and her menstrual fluid corrupts, and there is a delay in the coming of her courses, and pain occurs with her when she approaches her time, then it is necessary that he be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder, and cautery on the lower back, or two cauteries: and let it follow, according to what preceded cauterization nail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	As for the method of cauterizing the hymen in a case of its being torn...
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLI.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous membrane flows with moisture to the vagina, and there is a cause of her exit from its place: and its sign is that his leg remains long on one side when they stand face to face: and the site of the tear is found in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Then let it be that the weakened one be cauterized on his own hymen with a similar circle of cautery: after you have marked the signs with the caustic substance around the hymen, as it returns: and let it fall into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the length of his cauterized part follow what preceded cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present with you, then cauterize him with three cauteries, with a large olive oil cautery: and let the depth of cautery follow according to the thickness of the skin of all.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then he cares for himself until he recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	The method of cauterizing in sciatic pain:
Caput XLIII.	Head XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the sciatic bone, and there is a cause for it, causing cold and humidity: the sick person should be cared for with the treatment mentioned in the division, and if it does not help, it should become old: then it should be necessary to separate the sick person from thick humors with foety pills, or with artificial pills, and others.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization in it is according to two ways: either with cauterizing with burning medications, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	With fire, there are many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	Of which one is that he cauterizes over the sciatic bone himself with three triangular cautery wicks, according to this form:
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good depth or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there should be space between each cautery of the amount of grease: and the cautery should be with oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When, however, the cauterization is in the middle on the top of the sciatic bone itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cautery wicks?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, which has the form preceding the dislocation of the sciatic bone, one: so that the circle contains all the sciatic bone.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin of the whole body.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in sciatic pain: when pain clings to the sciatic bone itself and does not extend all the way up to the pelvis and legs.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If, however, it extends up to the pelvis and legs, then he cauterizes himself with two wicks over the hip, over the spot where the pain is located, and with his own wick over the top of the leg slightly: and let the cautery be with a chisel.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And make the depth of the cauterization according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the sick person complains that the pain extends to near the toes, then cauterize him at that place with a single, double, triple or multiple punctures, as needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	If he complains of pain under the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize him at that place with a single knife cut.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And let your cauterization in everything be so that you do not burn the nerve ends or a large artery, and do not attract it towards an evil disease or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have indeed seen one and the other, from those who cauterized above the knee, and finished in cauterization, and the thigh was inflated until the tumor was attached to the foot, and it was pierced all over, and corrupted all over: then the solution of the wind happened, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men said about the cauterization of ancæ, whose cautery is this method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar mark on the iron, whose diameter is half the palm: and place it at the opening according to the thickness of the nail, or less than more: and inside that mark is a third mark.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And there is a space that is between any mark by the quantity of the thumb's knot: and let there be open marks on two sides: and let their height be almost like a knot, or two knots: and let them make handles from iron out of place in the marks.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be lit in the fire, until it reddens, and let it throw sparks: then let it be placed on the pillow of the sick person who is lying on a healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Then cauterize him with three round cuts in one line.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let go of him after three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then bind it with butter: and let go of the wound that has been opened for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then the care of the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasius says, with this kind of cauterization of the son, we are a little afraid, because of the appearance of it: and therefore, because we have few who wait over him.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	But it is true that he who suffers from good cauterization, and finds with him the place of his wound.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But the cauterization is with the physicians who attend it, so that you make two holes in the arm of it, in which descends a pin of its door from iron or brass, the length of its walls: whose two knots are, or almost the same as themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be space that is between each of the two amounts of thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let there be what contains itself adinučem, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then put it on the patient lying on his back over a dry place.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand strongly over the dry place.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles of hot water, which is warmed with fire a little, and hold it for a time of time: and let the patient tolerate the bite of it, and his burn, because he finds the bite as fire, until he is quiet from the bite.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then wipe your hand with an instrument, and wash away hot water from all of it with sweet water: then let go of it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	Then put on it butter, until it is removed by the burn's blackness: and let go of it for a few days, and wash away the pus from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed last in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then the care of that with ointment, until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or the leg: let him have a resting place in it which holds water, according to what you did in the wide one.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the mode of hot water: and I have already written about it in the book of medicine's correction.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Grind the alkali and the unbaked calcine of both in a part, and separate them; make two balls out of them, and put each into a new pot with a small hole at the bottom for the quantity that is to be added; then place one ball under the other; throw over the alkali and the calcine water from a sweet spring, so that they are completely submerged; then squeeze them well in your hand; and leave the pots until the sharp water has dropped out of the lower part of the pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all the water, and throw it over the other; and let it rest until it has dried up.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For this will then be very sharp, which is used for many surgical operations and to cauterize the remaining parts of the body.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it achieves the purpose of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from the medicines are those that cauterize with broad, as well as thesis, and honey of the acorn, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And the doctor Galen himself reported that a certain man from ancient times was cured of pain in his anke and sciatic; and he praised it as being very effective.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that he did not like any other treatment, and that he was cured from one joint until he reported that perhaps he had entered a hot bath, and came out already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, to be taken from the patient's own urine; and if the urine is not found, it is taken thus: well mixed with a little fat, and placed on the anke where the pain is, or in the hip, or wrapped around the hip; and bound up, and left for a certain amount of hours, three hours, or more as the sick person feels the pain of tiredness.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce it into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When then his body becomes hot with the sweat, introduce him into the sun.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	The wound healed, and he was cured.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not necessary to use any medicine with these medicines unless after the body has been drained.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that when it is applied to the skin with sheep dung, it benefits those who have sciatica: and it becomes a second-degree burn.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	The wool is to be soaked in old oil and applied over the deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take sheep dung as it is, and set fire to it in the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then put the charcoal over the wool and leave it on until it goes out.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	So do not stop doing that until the sensation has subsided to the middle of the leg, and let the pain rest.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	This method of burning is called the Vaccine cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	For the pain of the back.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When the pain occurs on the back for various causes, or from a fall, or from being hit, or from excess evacuation, and similar things, by the infusion of cold and moist matter: and the burn does not fall except in this alone, which is made by infusing cold and dry matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary that after the draining of the nurse with foetid pills, and those similar to them, in order to make them on the back where there is pain, three lines are marked on the skin according to the width of the arm, after which five cauterizations or more are made according to the quantity that comes from the tolerance of the nurse's power: and let the burn be made with the cauterize.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, make three burns or four burns with a small needle according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the method of burning in the gibbus.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 54.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	These diseases frequently occur in young infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of this disease in children is that it occurs: which comes to him constriction in panting during elevation and movement, and inflammation at the last vertebrae of the spine and its joints, which has already begun to rise above the remaining vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	So when you see this, and do that, then burn him with fire according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And he should take the fire on all parts of the spine equally: and if you want to burn with fire two or three points around the spine: and there are points opposite each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place, until it is healed with him that we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And do not apply fire to the hunchback, which occurs due to a spasm of a nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of burning for gout and pains of joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter LXVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of joints are from cold moisture that is spread to any member of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of doctors to call this Podagra by name.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	So when Podagra of cold cause is cured with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then fire should remove those pains.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is as if he were burned around the joint of the foot with many burns: and let the fire be olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you can tolerate to touch points on the foot's surface, then do it with fire.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	That if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this disease frequently occurs: then burn him on all sides of the knee with three burns or four from all parts, with this same fire of cloves.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If however you need many of these fires, then burn him.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with fire, but let there be a certain thickness of skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If, however, the pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we have said from the cautery in its own chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	That if the pains are only in the hands, then points around the fire, as the two lines resolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If, however, the pain remains in the fingers, then points them, over every knot a point, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both sides entirely.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not leave the sick person in bad condition from good regime, from the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if the regime is made good, and the phlegm is expelled, it will be healed with this aid of God.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	§ On the mode of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture has occurred in the groin, and has descended into the intestine, or to the testicle, and it is beginning to be close by: then you should order the sick person to leave his food on the day of his sickness.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And he should use laxatives, so that the dung comes out from his own belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back, and order him to hold his breath until he goes out, or appears the testicle, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then let him reduce himself with your fingers, and mark him with the caustice under the rupture over the edge of the pear-bone, with the mark whose extreme is equal to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then let him hold the caustic fire in this shape, until it is white, and let him spit out the small pieces.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then let him reduce the intestine, or the testicle to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the minister put his hand on the place so that he does not lose the intestine: and you have already opened between the thighs of the sick person, and placed below it a towel, and one serving as another leans over the thighs of him, and one lies on the chest of him who holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then deposit the caustic on the wound, with your hand holding the caustic in a straight position.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him, until you are satisfied with his condition: or else repeat the force with him a second time, if you are not satisfied with him in the first instance to the throat.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine at the time of your cauterization, so that you do not burn him, and let it pass through it into the disease or death, or a great ill.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know, that when you do not succeed with the caustic to the throat, your operation is of no effect.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the caustic be subtle for infants, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care with the rest of the ointment, until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let him lie prone on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed up.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you place nutrition for the length of time of his cure, which softens his belly: so that he does not evacuate the intestine by straining and by feces.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he is ready to rise after forty days, then administer a loosely made ligature, and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him abstain from work, and from filling himself with food and drink, and from noisy speech.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regime, he is healed by whole cure.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the cure of ruptures with an incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are incipient, and do not enter, then cauterize his rupture with round caustic according to its quantity: and let it be as he is burned from then on like the third part.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for him, with him that we have said: and do not add to him.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some first said that the rupture should be cauterized with round caustic, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After the wound has been closed with caustic, and a line has been drawn across the lower part of the upper rupture, and another line has been drawn downward.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the caustic ointment.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the caustic is easier and better to begin with.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	As for the way of applying the caustic, in pain due to injury, or because of pounding.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in some member due to injury or because of pounding, and that pain persistes for a long time and there is no benefit from medicine: then it should be treated with the caustic ointment of punctum.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the caustic be of the same size as the member, and its condition, and its weakness, and its strength, and its twist, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	But if he is healed by the first caustic, then it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat the application of the caustic.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because from the custom of these kinds of pains is that they change from one member to that which approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Why should those who follow be treated with the caustic, until the sick are healed?
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	As for the way of applying the caustic, in leprosy:
Caput XLIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But lepers should be treated with the greatest care.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of leprosy that is due to the putrefaction of phlegmon and melancholy: so consider carefully how you treat it with the caustic.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If, however, leprosy is incurable, and if you have treated it with that which we mentioned in the division, and if it has not fallen off, nor stayed on: and if the corruption comprehends the whole of its skin: then treat it with five caustics on the head: one in the middle of the scalp between the ears, and a second lower down towards the front at the end of the hair, and two above the two temples, and one behind the ear.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And lastly, with your hand slightly pressed down by the cauldron, until it impresses a puffy impression on the mouth, and the membranes are dislocated from it; so that the exhale of great vapors is alleviated from it, and also the cautery is cauterized over the same spleen, according to which it has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread on the sick person, and appears clearly; then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauteries which we have said in the head, and cautery over the extreme end of the nose, and two cauteries over two cheeks, and two cauteries over the two sides of the neck, and six over the spine of the back, and one great one over the alhahoso at the ends of the tail and one above it, in which are wrapped: and two over the shoulders: that is, one over all the shoulder with one, and two over the knees: that is, one over each knee, and two over the shoulders, and two over the tender parts of the chest of his own: and cautery over all the joints, from the joints of the fingers of his hands, and his feet: and cautery over all the heel of his feet, and the nails of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And let you be careful of the nerves which are above the last heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when one is cauterized with a cauldron over the ossa pectiris, and another over the ossa stomachi, and another over the spar.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And you should know that the more you add cautery, the greater the benefit is, and the more it confers.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you should know that the sick person does not find pain in cautery, as he finds it in a healthy body: therefore, because his body is already stupified.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries be of a good size, and varied according to the limbs and joints: because they precede according to the tools of the instrument.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the cauteries with flour of herb with honey, and with other cures, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	To cauterize while in a stupor.
Caput L.	Head.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a member is stuporized and treated with medicines, oils, plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize the said stupored member with cauterizations, according to which the magnitude of the member increases or the size of it decreases.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery sit in the thickness of the skin a little.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the said member with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes cauterized at some stupor that happened to the hand, and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of nerves that move that member: and the stupor is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But do not hesitate about it, unless you are wise in the anatomy of members, and the exit of nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	The way to cauterize while in a stupor.
Caput LI.	Head.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras is burned and does not bring anything from the arts of medicine: then cauterize a little above that deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the skin changes color and turns.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for the said member with wheatgrass, and rose oil, and leaves of arglochea, and pigeon blood, and duck blood: let one part be mixed, and be laid on a cloth, and adhere to the place until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	The way to cauterize while in a stupor.
Caput LII.	Head.Si qui in Cancro cum cauterio profundiorem non
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning, and the eye must be put on it: then cauterize the said eye with a circular cautery, as it turns around.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But wise people have said, "Let the last cautery be used in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But I do not see that: because I fear that it will ulcerate: and I have already seen it a few times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize it on the circumference of it with a circle, as we have said: or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	To cauterize in adubelah.
Caput LIII.	De modo cauterizandi in adubelati.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When anyone has adubelah and is delayed in maturing, or because it is unnecessary to make it, or because of old age, so that it is a few blood, or because of time, and the sight of it is rushing into maturation, then cauterize around it with small blisters with points by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let go of it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten in its maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you pierce its sight with a cautery, then take this fire cautery, which has this shape.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And put it in the middle of adubelah, until it penetrates the skin: and place the cautery from it that follows behind, so that it eases the course of the blood.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	The way to cauterize in a bad rotten place.
Caput LIIII.	De modo cauterizandi in adubelati.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A rotten thing is not but decay in a member that walks, and it rots its own self: as fire dries up dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	But if you see a rotten thing in a place that accepts a cautery with fire, then take many cautery-fire, small claws and big ones, according to what suits it in the place where the rotten thing is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize the person from all parts until you root out all the corruption, and there does not remain any of it within.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let go of the person for three days, and place sulfur-ash over the cauterized places with oil, until it eradicates all the scars, and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then take care of the person with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	But if you see that, after three days, the flesh is born with a healthy birth, where there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cautery on that which remained of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	He heals a corroding wound when it is sometimes treated with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	But she herself rises at the place of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, the cauterization is faster with fire: and indeed I have already said that cauterization with acute medicine is to be done gradually: so take it there when you are ready for it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	§ On the way of cauterizing in Clefts and Warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This sickness often occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a gross disease, filtered, which hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed there are two ways of cauterizing them: cauterizing with fire, and cauterizing with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	How much, then, is it with fire, so that the flames of the cautery are similar to the feathers of a branding iron: which is to be made of iron, according to the quantity that it contains at the joint from all parts: and let it be sharp at the edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the burned one on the claw.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn the claw with the cautery around it, until the cautery reaches the depth of the claw: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then bind the wound with coarse silken threads, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on the wound at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will itself be根除根除根除
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a generous ointment of meat, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	But if they are not turned into scabs, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then administer to them hot water cauterization: and it is as though you receive a claw, made of iron, or a branding iron: place it on the claw, or a toothpick.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then drop a small amount of hot water into the pipe: hold your hand, and turn it slightly with your thumb, so that the edge of the pipe is imprinted in the root of the claw, and find hot water to the depth, to the root of the claw: and let the sick person wait for a while on the prickling of the hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let go of him, for the claw is removed with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Then do this to them one by one, until you have come to all that are in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they have been removed, with that which generates flesh from the stump.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	The way to cauterize in tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to anyone that there is tremor from cold in a nerve, or from fever quartan, or some other: then it is necessary that one should cauterize him four times, or five on the spine at the back, and between all the spine a cauterization, and in his chest a cauterization, and above the stomach a cauterization.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor is calmed by an olive oil cauterization, and quickened is the health of sickness of cold.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	The way to cauterize according to Al-Bahir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When the Al-Bahir foul substances, that is, pustules which are made from gross corrupted materials, are discharged from the body.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is necessary then, at first when they appear, that they should be cauterized over the whole head of the pustule with a fine cautery made of myrrh, whose end is incensed with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long Aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cauterizer.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized with blood, at first their discharge according to this mode: and they do not increase: and they break off the excess, healing from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that that be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	The way to cauterize in a flow of blood from an artery in the arm.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.De modo autem illud faciendi est
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	However, this way of doing it is made: often a flow of blood comes from an artery cut in the arm, which has happened externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or at cauterization of a limb, and such: and it is difficult to remove him.For the blood does not come out easily, because it has congealed with the fat; and, if you try to press it, pain and a beating will result.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	So if it happens to anyone of you, then hold the end of the artery with your hand and place the index finger on top of it: and squeeze it very much, until the blood stops flowing under your finger, and nothing comes out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put a few small olive oil wicks on fire, and many more: and blow on them until they are very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or small, or big, according to the size and location of the broken artery, and place the wick on it, then remove your finger quickly: and hold the wick, until the blood comes out.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	That if you expel it with your finger away from the opening of the artery, and put out the wick, then take another wick quickly from the wicks that are prepared on fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So you shall not stop doing this with one after another, until the blood stops coming out.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful, so that you do not burn the wick that is there, and does not happen to another evil malice.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when the blood flows out of an artery, then it is not possible to remove it: especially if the artery is large, unless with four measurements.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a wick, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends contract, and the blood comes out.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is bound with a strong yarn.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or are placed on top of the flesh for its property, whose blood should be stopped, and is squeezed with a feather-like compression.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever performs this incision with a knot, and tightening with cloth, or positioning of burning things and others, does not give it a complete wound, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if it happens to anyone of you, and the doctor is not present with him, nor medicine: then begin with the positioning of the index finger on top of the opening of the wound as we have said, and its compression very much, until the blood stops flowing from the upper part of the wound, and is placed on the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And do not move the finger, above it with cold water always moving the frosty, until the blood is congealed, and thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And while considering, what does he need from the poultice or the medicine?

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On incision, perforation, and phlebotomy on wounds and similar cases.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the First Chapter about all sicknesses that are treated with fire and medicine combined, their occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of poultices.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed there from the apex to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: that he may find relief for his inquiry.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, you should know that this book is of fear as it was said in the First Chapter about the cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for that, a greater caution is needed, since in the operation described in this chapter, often comes an effluxion of blood, with which the life goes out at the opening of the bowel, or incision on a blister, or opening of an exitula, or cure of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision on a stone, and similar cases: from all of which tremor and fear associate, and death often comes in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, so that it does not come to you that is of hesitation, for sometimes what comes to you in this art of men with the ways of sicknesses can also come to you.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from them is one who is angered with his sickness, and is easily dead: because of the severity that he finds from his sickness and the length of his illness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when sickness is of fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from them is one who gives you his money and promises you with it, hoping for health, but his sickness is pernicious.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it is not necessary that you should agree with him who comes to you from them, whose mode is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And be your caution greater than your greed and your avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume about anything from him, unless after knowing for certain that which comes to you by way of his achievement deserves praise.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And that you use all your skills in the care of all your sick patients, in prognosis and in indicating what is suitable for their cure.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	In him indeed is your help in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O son, with his understanding, and may he not remove from you his guidance and inspiration: for it is in his hands.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I myself have arranged this chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, following the order that preceded in the Chapter of Cautery from the nape to the feet: so as to alleviate what you want from him and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Of the Care of Water Which is Added to the Heads of Young Boys.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this illness often occurs in boys at the time of birth: or when the midwife grips the boy's head without gentle handling.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it also happens for an unknown reason which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I myself have not seen this illness in others but in boys; and I consider all of them worthy of death: because of which, therefore, I have abandoned the practice of performing operations on them.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I myself have seen from among them a boy whose head was swollen with water, and his head became great every day until he could not sit on himself of his own volition because of its size; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, or it is added between the skin and the jaw: or it is added under the bone over the jaw.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the abcess is small, then you should find a crack in the middle of the head's length: and let the length of the crack be almost two knots, until the moisture runs.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a scalpel.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	But if the moisture is increased and the abcess is larger, then place them two cracks, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and there is a sign of it, which you see as the comissures of the head are open from all sides: and when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide from you: then you should find in the middle of the head three cracks, according to this way.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after cutting remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tighten the cracks with rags and powder.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then dip it in wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then dissolve the ligaments, and take care of the tendon with bandages and ointment.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not cease to tighten the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick with dry food that is deficient in moisture until their member is healed and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	Another way of cutting is to consider where the abcess appears large, and where the collection of water is.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because when it is larger at the back or the front or on the right or left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So ascendi with the cut where you see the abcess and the filling of water, and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe that you do not hit an artery, and let blood flow, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Regarding the arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When it happens to anyone that there is a cataract on the eyes or on the chest and it is old, and does not respond to treatment with medicine: then the last treatment in that is cutting these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	One should therefore when one wishes to incise them, so that the sick man may not shake his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then he will cover the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick man should tie his neck with any of his own cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the new pulse is beating.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places on either side are those which are behind the ears: and seldom except in some men do they hide themselves.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with the caustic on each side: and cut each with a sharp knife, while aiming for the mouth: and let it go through the thickness of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish to cut the artery, introduce the blade beneath it, and cut it from above with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And make the length of the incision almost like two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the new pulse is incised, blood flows out with a pulsating movement, which rises to the inside at frequent intervals.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If the artery does not appear to the touch, then you should measure the distance from the ear by three fingers' length.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with the caustic and find until it reaches the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what needs to be done is to let out six drops of blood, and perhaps you let out a little more or a little less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All this depends on the quantity which appears to you from the nerve when it is stretched, and on the filling of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider towards the spine.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	If there remains anything at the mouth, cut it so as not to cause a blister, then tie the spine with linen thread.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the patient with ointment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Regarding the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man that he has an old headache, or acute catarrah from acrid and irritating humidities, and heat in the temples, or old soda, bitter, and similar things: and he is treated with the methods of medical science, and does not provide this: then we have been experienced in these diseases in extracting the arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in their extraction is, that a wounded hair which is in the temporal region is removed, and directed toward the apparent artery in the temporal region.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	And it is shown to you from its own pulsation, and rarely concealed unless in a few people, or if it trembles sharply from cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then the injured man should wrap his head with any cloth: and then he should find a dry place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or he should warm the spot with hot water until a clear vision appears to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a knife which is slightly sharpened.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the skin together with ease until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw into it a hook, and pull it upward, until you have pulled it out of the skin, and let it flow from the tunics which are under it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is thin: then wrap it up with the hook's end.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from it on one side in proportion to how long its ends are extended, and bind them together so that no blood flows out.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not separated, the blood will not go deep.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then let flow out of its blood half a drachm until three drachms.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it should be bound in two places with double thread, strong, and silk; or with horsehair so that it does not properly adhere to it before the wound has healed, and blood flows out.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess which is between the two bindings.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, burn it with a caustic until it reaches the mouth, with a surgical scalpel: so that its ends will be cut off, and it will stay in place of its own accord.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And this work is better if the sick person has a fever, or if he has a heated complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cautery is from those that remain to complete the moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to bandage.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries, so that the place may be filled with old heat: and let be placed over it downy woolen cloth made loose.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after solution with dry medicines, which make the flesh grow, and with liniments, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if, while you are operating, a flow of blood comes from an artery, then proceed to cut it off with the cautery, or to fill the place with blood: and tighten your hand, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	That if you have nothing present for this, then place your finger on the spot, until the blood congeals.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And dip the place in water of cold wetness, until the pain subsides, and tighten it according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from that which is softer and easier to extract the artery, it is, as if the knife with this cautery having two blades: and the sharpness of the two blades is like an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than the two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Since if they are acute, as the two knives, it is fitting that both have coldness: and do not strike the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	So that if there is a little roughness in them, heat of fire is held in them, and the flesh is cut off quickly: so that with this, it is better for every work, and softer, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And set a space that is the quantity of the roughness of the finger between the two knives after you have marked the two places with the caustic: and put both burning vigorously, until they come to the tip, and strike exactly in the two places: so that it extends what is between its extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	Since they are not solidified by this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of acute and chronic eye tears.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are persistent and the course of the tear channels is clear, they extend from the outer part of the skull to the front of the head; nor do they require any medicine with physicians, for the eyes begin to turn red and feel a stinging sensation in the forehead, like that of ants walking on it: the eyelids become hot due to the acuteness of the tears; then the ancient people used to treat them with this operation, and called this treatment "Ensa.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And is it not as you command the sick person to shave the hair on his forehead?
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions in the forehead equidistant from each other according to the length of the forehead; and let the length of the incision be almost two fingers, and let one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second, according to the length of a little more than half a finger, from the first by the movement of the scalpel; and the third, from one side to the other: and take care not to cut the arteries that are in the two sides: and extend your hand from the junction of the two jaws, and let the space between each incision be the length of three joined fingers: and have you a sponge prepared or dry cloth with which to dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the spatula at both ends of the acute incisions, whose following shape is:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is on the temporal side up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions with sifac, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then also do this from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then take this spatula out and insert into the first incision again another tool called an acute chisel, smooth on one side, not acute on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape:
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place his acute side away from the flesh attached with skin, and his soft side opposite the bone: and push him forward until he reaches the middle crevice; and cut off with him all tools that come down from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues until it appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then place him in the middle crevice until he reaches another crevice.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after the quantity of blood has run out equally, express the places from the clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every crevice the ash of old bread, and place on top of them wet rags soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And be careful not to cause a swelling that is hot.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the ligaments and administer a strong infusion with lukewarm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with basilicum ointment, and with the rest of the ointments used to treat wounds: until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	On the care of acute tears and cataracts on the eyes from inside the head.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When any acute cataract, bitter, persistent, and the eyes seem exhausted, pale, and their appearance is already weakened: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls out from them, and there is a sharp pain in the depths of the head, and subsequent sneezing: then remove these accidents, because those materials do not come until they have been removed by many.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And a better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is as if you were to shave the person's forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut in one fissure in the middle of the forehead, or a little more around the width, and begin with the crevice from the left time to the right side: and make the incision all the way down to the bone: and extend your hand from the jaw bones that move during mastication: until it is closed completely: and you will dry out all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the wound with a hot cloth, or with liniments from linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind above it with wool: and dip the wool in wine and oil, so that hot swelling does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have loosened it, and you see that hot swelling is about to break out: then it is necessary that you cut off the nose, until it begins to grow there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for him with the drying treatment which causes flesh to grow: as if you had taken two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare an ointment from it, and administer it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	As for the care of him who falls into Golden Death.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls into Gold is of four kinds: either stone-like substance, or similar to stone, such as iron and lead; or from plants, such as chickpeas and beans; or fluid substance, such as water and vinegar, and like substances; or some kind of creature.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone falls into Gold, or of a kind of stone that does not contribute to the growth of Gold, and does not grow in it, expose Gold to the sun: if then you see a stone, then distill in Gold some of oil inflected, or of mustard seed.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make it snort with ointment, and anoint his nostrils when he is approaching from the wind, after you have put on him, around the ear, cloths or wool, and raise up the ear towards the sky.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For this treatment has often gone astray.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not go astray, then administer the extraction of it with a subtle hand: whose shape is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	But if it goes astray with the hand, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a small, soft hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If then he does not go out by that [method], then make a tube of brass, and insert the extreme end of the tube into the hole of the ear much, and the dust which is in the circumference of the tube with the brass softened with oil, so that there is no passage for the wind except through the tube: then draw it out with your breath strongly.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For very often he went out with it when we were describing [it].
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if not in this way then take it from the skullcap, or from water, that is to say, gluten prepared with which they pluck feathers, and put the same on the end of the radius after you have dried up the ear from the moisture. Then insert it into the hole of the ear easily, after you have placed it askew: then insert it into the ear hole with ease, after you have placed it askew: then insert it into the ear hole with ease, after you have placed it askew:
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	But if not with all that we have described, then approach to cut off, before the hot apoplexy or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the way of the incision is so that the phlebotomy cuts into the head first: and draw out the blood from it according to the measure of its virtue.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear towards the top, and find a small hole in the base of its ear next to its fat in a depressed place: and let the hole be lunar shape, until you reach the stone: then remove it with that, which is possible for you from instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then close the hole at once with your breath, and be careful of it, until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If then what falls into the ear is from one grain, which grows, and swells up: then administer the extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you to come out, then take a thin straw, fine, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the cutting out of that piece from the grain which falls into the ear, and do not put it off when you think that that grain has already become moist by the ear's vapor, until you have laid many straws on it: then draw it out with a hook, or with a soft gesture, or with a suction, as we said, for the extraction of it is pleasant.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water, however, that is put into the ear, it should be used by the sick with Sternutation, when it is first put on; and he has already filled his ear with some boiled water: and he lies down on that ear, where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If then he comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many small stones, according to the length of a finger, soft, and warm them a little with fire, and put one of them into the hole of his ear; and let him spit on one of his feet from that part, and hit it with another stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	So therefore do not cease to do this with stones and rocks, until he comes out all water.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now he comes out water so that you take from the stump, or from the branch of a tree, and put the end on one ear; and light the end with fire, until it is burned well.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the branch again and often do this until he comes out all water; and take it out with a tube according to what has been said before in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	But in the extraction of an animal that enters into it, if it is a small body, like a flea, and such, take care of it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body, which seems to the sense: then administer the extraction of it with gestures and hooks; and its nature is easier for all those who hold it in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	But in the extraction of white animals that are in the ear, when you have to take care of it with what we said in division, and in the book of distillation, and your treatment does not benefit it: then you should look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If so then appears there something of white animals, then extract it with gestures, or with a thin hook.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if there is nothing of white animals there, then take the tube, whose this form is, narrow below, wide above: and put the end into the ear, according to the quantity that the sick person can bear it: and then suck with it a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	And so often, until all the blood comes out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to go out, then put the cane around them with the cauldron, as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	That if they do not go out with him that we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancient ones know in the infection of the wounds: and you will find that in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And may your flow be as if you pour oil and medicine into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it of silver, or of brass, lower down tight, in which sits a small hole, wide at the top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	So that he is set as if he pushes out what is in the constriction of the cane, he is made of brass slightly off-center.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take the ray, and rub it at the end of its cotton with a gentle rubbing: then pour oil, or juice, or what you wish from these medicines into the cane: and let it sit in brass: then put in the ray with the cotton, which has been slightly heated, and squeeze it out by hand, until it pushes out the oil in the constriction of the ear, and feels it inside as weak: and that which is dropped into the ear, let it be already warmed a little with fire: and do not allow to be what is distilled into it when it is cold; for these medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of the infection of gold.
Caput VII.	Head VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When certain children come out of their mothers' wombs not pierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some men that there is opilation in the ear from a cut or meat born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this opilation sometimes happens in the deep foramen of the ear, which does not respond to heat: and when it occurs on the outside of the foramen a little, it responds to heat.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which happens then in the deep foramen of the ear, and what does not respond to sight, is difficult to treat in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And when you see the resulting swelling, you should place a gold plaster on the sun and look at it; then, if you see an apparent operation, open it with a thin spatula, whose shape is this that follows, let the end of it be in some small width, some of whose parts are acute: and let the remaining spatula be soft on both sides: so that it does not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If then the operation is born of flesh on the ear-lobe: then hold it with a small hook, and cut it with ease in moving, until all the flesh is taken away.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	That if the operation is in the deep part of the ear: then take a small rayon, soft, and heat it slightly with fire: then put it on the ear-lobe.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If then you feel an operation with it that causes a problem with hearing with weight: try to operate on it with ease: and carefully, so as not to hurt the ear nerves.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put in the ear a little silver according to the quantity of width of the hole that you have made with Egyptian ointment: let it be for several days, until you are safe from the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a little silver, and pour it into rose water, and powder it on top, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	That if you see the ear already blistered: then it is necessary that you take out silver, and let it be with other silver, which you have made in green oil with rose water, until it cools down the blister with heat: and then look after the ear until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If however there is a flow of blood: then dip a sponge or a cloth in cold water and put it on the ear: and use the remaining cure that stops the predicted flow of blood in the book of distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Of the care of the eyelids of Althea.
Caput VIII.	Head 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the problems that occur in the eyelids of Althea when they are wet and dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	You should therefore keep them with the tenales: or with the hook, and strike them with the spatumيلي from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place over the places of the wound the third.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a subtle lenticular cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterize them, it is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many times they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Regarding the care of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	This often happens in the eyelids that a certain substance is absorbed by Grandin in its strength and hardness, and because of it is called Grado: and is an aggregation of moistness of gross matter in the upper eyelid, and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Operation then on them is, that you consider when, if the Grado proceeds in it, which appears from the eyelid, and moves to all parts, and the thing of it is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Then find over it a slit through its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape off the skin from all parts with ease, until it bleeds.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if you are not prepared to cut off its flesh, unless after you have made a slight incision in the eyelid, then it will hurt the sick in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Which if the slit is wide: then aggregate it with a stitch: and care for it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, will not come to you any harm from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	The patch will restore that skin and make it flesh again.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the Grado is falling towards the inner part of the ear towards the inside surface, then upside down the eyelid, and hang up the Grado with a hook: except that you cut off an incision, and press it from all parts.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is lengthened by an incision, that does not hurt in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision with cold water, and care for the place where it has become inflamed, until the injury heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	The Care of the Eyebrows.
Caput X.	Chapter Ten: The Care of the Eyes.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a grease that is generated in the eyelids of young men; and it often happens to boys; and it grates their eyes, and makes them have cataracts in the morning, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because the tears flow towards them, and therefore they always rest on their cheeks, and sleep upon them, and their eyelids are wet and swollen, and you can feel Axirnath between your fingers when you press the place.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And its mode of action is that the injured person puts his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen cloth, and prepare it with a fold, and make from it a circle according to the amount that contains Axirnath from all parts.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put it on top of it, and press it with your fingers from all parts so that Axirnath is pressed in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find, in the middle of it, a wet place with a cotton swab that is incident on a crack across its width, and there is no greater crack than that which is made in phlebotomy in the depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or you should find the whole skin, until you reach Axirnath, for in many dispositions Axirnath proceeds from a crack, according to the form of the white patch.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Then remove it with the cloth that you have soaked between your fingers towards the outside: and you should shake your hand to and fro, until it is scattered; and carefully, so that you do not add to the crack, so that you do not press with a cotton swab on the eye, and let it go.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If, however, you do not see the axillary nerve at the beginning of the incision, you should insert it into the incision with some ease until the axillary nerve comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then, remove it from outside, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then, dip the cloth in vinegar and water, and place it on the spot, and tightly with flour.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are people who grind salt, and put it in the incision, so that what remains of the moisture melts.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of yourself, until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If, however, a blister occurs at the site, then take care of the blister with dry plasters, until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	As for the modi of attakmir eyes, that is, when the eyelids become soft to the eye, since it can cause it to turn red as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow in the eyelids besides their natural course, and run under them: then they hurt the eye, and cause diseases such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and cloudiness, until they destroy the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And attakmir eyes are treated according to four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicine, as outlined in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or is treated by incision and suturing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with needles, as I call it.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It should be placed on the head of the nurse in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then, with your left hand, close the eye with your finger.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is closed, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert a needle into it, where there is a filament from the lower part of the eyelid, and let it penetrate with the thread from above, and let it sit next to the hairs themselves, that is, next to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and draw the thread upward with the lid, and close it with a loop.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find the inner part of the eyelids under the lashes with the spatula incident from the greater lacrimal to the smaller lacrimal.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the filament and place a fine downy hair under the eyelid from bread or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with encaustic, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid; for this varies very much in man.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From these it is, that which needs to be made so that it incident from the eyelid quantity great, according to the quantity which softens by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then find with the spatula over two lines which you marked, and begin from the greater lacrimal to the smaller lacrimal, and let there be one gap near the natural hair, as is the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce the hook into one of two angles of skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape it all.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather with a suture two lips, with an acorn and a thin wool thread: and wipe away the blood, and let what is superfluous adhere from the hairs on the two eyelids, with some things that are invisible to you, if you wish to do so: and if not, it does not matter.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then remove the suture and thread until three or four days: then take care of that.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, remove the hook without a stitch, and take care of it with it, that it dries up and shrinks.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised at the seal of the wound and aggregation thereof; but a better one will come later.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This way of treating Ataxmir taught the ancients.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is a worry about the sick, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in that.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another way is also for Ataxmir: and it is, as you mark a figure on the eyelid which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have reported.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then with three separate hooks, or gathered together, wipe the eyelids, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, and with equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if you cannot hold the hook and it does not fit [the wound]: then take a needle where the thread is, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread next to the larger tear, and a second thread next to the smaller tear: and gather the threads between your fingers with equal tension.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then wash your hand with equal washing: and wash the skin above where the seam is marked, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a stitch: and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if a pimple should occur near your incision, or a crack: but let that pimple and those similar ones sit on oil-based ointment.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelids also turn inward because of his hair.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is therefore necessary that you use on it what we have said in the incision: but the stitch on both sides is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Of the care of Ataxmir with scissors.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And is it not that you turn inward the eyelids and split the crack which is inside, according to what we have said?
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then with art make two scissors, or two thin sticks: whose length is according to the length of the eyelids, and their width is less than the width of a hairpin: and you have already cut at the ends of each side where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather together each one with delicacy on what is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and firmly tighten the two scissors on both sides with a strong tightening, and let go after a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin is tight and will die, and will rot, and will decay until it falls away by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	But if it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it, until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When then it is hardened, the lid is lifted off: and I do not prick the hair.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two cannas, which you shall make according to this figure, and the quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	§ On pricking the hairs in the eye with an aiguille.
Caput XII.	Head XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in that is, that you should take an aiguille fine, and insert it into the eye with a thread fine.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then tu dost bunch the ends of it, and knotted each knot with a fine thread: and let the length of the hairs be a palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then you shall take another fine thread under the eye, and compose it with the first, and knot the ends of it if thou wilt.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then you shall put the sick head in your lap, and set it nigh the sun, that the operation may be declared: for it is an subtle operation, or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then you shall insert the aiguille with the alinxotated in the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate into the eyelid quickly, until you take it out above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the hair up till above the alinxotated: and insert it into the alinxotated hair: if it be one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw thy hand with it, until the hair that is with the alinxotated comes out of the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If then the alinxotated is drawn out, and the hair does not come with it: draw the alinxotated down, with the thread that thou hast composed in it, until the alinxotated comes out of the upper opening, and keepeth it from the sight of the eye: then draw out both, and shut them both up, and let them remain two days, or three, until the hair hath grown into its place, and hath begun to grow upon the flesh.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If hair is short, then either add a long hair from natural hairs, and remove it with it; or leave it alone until it grows longer after a space, and then remove it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Regarding the treatment of an injury to the upper eyelid as described by Al-Zahrawi.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII: Head.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When it affects the eye, this is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Al-Zahrawi can be either a natural one or an accidental one.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	So the accidental one is when it results from the consolidation of a wound, or a cut, or a cauterization, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of treatment for it is so that you find its consolidation, and that you separate its edges, and place a ligature between them from linen, and tie it up, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And you should not use for its treatment those things that burn and tighten: because if you do so, it will return worse than it was before; but use for it those things that soften, such as garlic; and dip it with water in which althaea is boiled, and semen lini, and an oil; and rub it with a linen cloth, and care for it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you should seek every device to prevent its consolidation, according to the form it had at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation that I have described is no more than a certain correction of Albucasis so that the form of the place does not return at all after it has been completely changed.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Regarding the treatment of an injury to the lower eyelid, which is a wrinkling or tightening upward toward the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XXII: Head.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Al-Zahrawi that affects the lower eyelid is what is called Al-Zahrawi.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it can be either a natural one or an accidental one.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one is when it affects from a wound, or a tear, or a cauterization, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And when you have performed the operation on her, take hold of it now, where there is a double thread, and dip it in flesh, and let it penetrate from the left tear sac to the right tear sac, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upward with a sharp knife, and cut it with a scalpel on the side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the shape of the eyelid returns according to what needs to be done, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the radium, and put it in the crack, and turn it with it: and find the two cracks on the inner side of the eyelid, and are the ends of the two cracks from two angles of incision, until they meet and become one angle: until when they come together, let this figure be made, and is a Greek letter praise.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then take away the flesh by its quantity, which is the sharp lower side of it, from there that follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts together: sew them with wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with what I have said, about medicines that soften, and liniments, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if it is a wound from a crack, and suturing, or cauterizing: then you need to find a flat crack under the eyelids' hairs, also according to what preceded it.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the two lips with a liniment, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the whole speech about the care of an Alxatriate wound, when it is above, or below, is, that it may run in that operation, according to what is prepared from the form of Alxatri.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	It is itself of many different shapes: and the skilled craftsman prepares it with whatever is possible for him, until he returns its shape to a natural one, or near to it, and also sickens himself, according to what is suitable for him from operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	About the adherent membranes of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	And when this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents itself from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	It is necessary that you insert the end of the ring under the eyelid and raise it up: or extend it with a tiny hook: then cut the adhesion with a very fine scissor, which is not sharp in the incision of the scissors, but rather blunt slightly: so that the sick person is not disturbed during the operation, and moves the scissor, and hurts his eye with its keenness: and make your incision as if you were peeling it off the adhesion, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and heals the whole adhesion.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour into the eye salt water, with water washing it: or distill in it from an essence made from dissolved zinc with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with linseed oil: and place on the eye wool infused with alum: and after three days use essence, and with consolidates, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	About the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of the tears.
Caput XVI.	De incurvare ungulam qui est in corne
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is curved according to two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nerveous: and it is similar to a hard sifac stone, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nerveous, similar to frozen moisture of white: which when touches iron, or a hook takes it away with a hook, it does not adhere to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both species do not begin, unless from the larger tear: until they are gradually detected, until they cover the whole eye, and prevent the light, and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the way to operate on it is: so that the sick person puts his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes and close his eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take the nail with a little hook and extend it upward.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert it into the eye with a few hairs of a horse's mane or a wolf's tail: and make the thread strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the center of the nail: and pierce it with a sharp pin, and tie the thread to the nail, and extend it upward: and scrape the flesh with the hair of the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were clamping it down with the hair until it reaches its base.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut off the residue at the base of the eyelid with a sharp blade or a tiny awl: and let go of the natural tear-dripping flesh, so that the course of tears is not interrupted by the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with a hook on its own: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it with a soft blade whose shape is like this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware that the blade does not touch the horny tunic, and that it does not break open and pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, pour into the eye some salt that has been crushed, or make a solution from rosewater, and let it sit until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the eye with whatever is necessary, until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nerved, and you cannot insert an akind of hook into it, and the nail cannot be fixed with a nail: then often treat this kind of nail with medicines, and it heals as slowly as a nail does.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you want to cut the nail, then open the eye to heal it, and take a very sharp blade, gentle in sharpness, of this kind:
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And with subtle sharpness scrape the nail from top to bottom.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that the nail is getting thinner and thinner, and it is being scraped by the rasp, then distil from your own eye at any time into the eye with crushed rosemary, or with ground salt, or with a strong solution: and blind the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then he cuts again on that part, until he has removed all of it.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot abcess in the eye: for then you should let go of that part, and take care of the abcess until it has healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then he cuts again on that part with a razor, until it has healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	Except for the tears of the eye, if it hurts very much, it should be suspended with a hook, and cut from that part; and you should not make the last cut, lest the course of tears be disrupted.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then pour red wine into the eye, or make a paste out of zin: until it has healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Regarding the incision of Algardenic and the flesh that is born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	It is born when, in the eyes of some men, red flesh is placed, either on top or covering it up until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or squeezes it onto the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it is absorbed into the rosy chequers.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on that part is also to place a sick head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and take all that flesh with a hook suitable for it: and hold it with one fork, or grasp it.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut into the flesh first, until you have finished off all of it with a knife.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And cause a distance from the eye so that you do not hurt yourself during the operation: and let your cut be this one while you are cutting it, or with a chisel, which we have described in the incision of a nail: or with small forks, with which the hook is gathered, according to which form it will take after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your cut is complete and all of the Algardenic has been removed, then pour into the eye crushed salt: or distil into it red powder, and similar things from corrosives: and put on the eye a cloth with alum, so that it is secure against the hot abcess.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If something remains from the aludden [aloud] and warm blood prevails over you, and the swelling is warm: then release the eye, and take care of it as it rests the swelling.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then apply again to the area with the operation, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And also do the same for the flesh added which happens in the eye from this type.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you do not interrupt the cure of any weak eye from its natural way, or from an accidental way, operating with iron: and do not insert your hand in any of these operations, until it heals, since that limb is tolerating that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Regarding the collection of sebum from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	The sebum are bright red plaques that cover the eye, and prevent it from the operation of iron: and weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary that you first, if the eye in which there is sebum is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides the sebum: then collect the sebum of it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And is, as you command the sick one, to put his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those plaques with a hook one, or two, according to your prudence: and may the hook be thin, according to this form, or let there be two hooks in the body one, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then with subtle hooks gather those plaques with subtlety, and wash the blood an hour after an hour until they fall off the plaques from the eye, and are resolved: and do not leave the eye with sharp edges.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation strongly: so that you do not fall except on those plaques.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have emptied it, then distill into the eye strong iron, or red: so that its own acidity may corrode what remains of sebum.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If, however, you are not able to collect that whole thing in that hour, then bandage the eye with the ointment which soothes the pain of the eye; and leave him for a few days until his pain subsides: and keep him away from heat: then apply again to him in the same way until he is well.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the method of the forbic.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	The following is about reducing a wart to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	They mention a surgical instrument called the Arissati tube, which is used with caustic or burning medicine in accordance with what precedes in his narrative.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if he does not recover, then there is no skill in it: unless you find the bump at his birth, and extract all the moisture that is in it and the puss, until the hole is discovered.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the hole is discovered, and you see corruption or discoloration in it, then shave him with an instrument whose form is this one.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the head of the aspergid.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron bar and let the head be round like an aspergid, so that it is punctured with a file, or with a fine nail-file: and let him be placed on the site of the corruption of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll him between your fingers, and press your hand gently, until you know that that corruption is now shaved: and do it several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the site with drying stipple medicine.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If, however, the site has consolidated and a bone has grown up in it, and the wound has healed and there is no ulceration or discharge, then you shall know that he is now well.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it, unless you reduce the tube to the nose, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And is, in order to discover a second bone with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is detected, then take a small hammer according to this form, its end being iron, triangular: and let the wood be extended to an angle, as you see it.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that upon his own skull: and let it be near his tear ducts: and extend your hand from his eye slightly.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the skull, until it penetrates the bone and he feels pain: through this, he will notice that something is coming out of him when he holds his own hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore at that time restore the position with the medicines that burn, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore the flesh is born and the place hardens: then the matter that is poured out to the outside returns to the nose: so it is lighter on the sick.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	De Reduction of Ocular eminence
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye emitteth all its own content, and does not happen to be without vision or diminution: then you should remove the disease: then phlebotomy him: then place wind instruments on the forehead without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put on the eye a liniment made of acacia, and aloe, and olive oil, and sea-kollo:
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tighten the eye from above over the plaster with various dusts.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the dusts is this: that you take soft cloths, many, and double every cloth on four: make from them many: then put them one over another, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then tighten them together with a hard cloth in a strong fastening.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again wind instruments without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the wind instruments, and release the eye after tightening it during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If the ligament is again softened, then you should tighten it much: then remove the ligament after day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see that the eye has already been re-tightened with new ointment, it is good: and if not, then again apply plaster, and dusts, and fastening, and wind instruments, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Regarding the incision of the royal tunics.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a tear occurs in the royal tunic, then it is removed and taken out beyond the eyelids like a grain of wheat, and fed upon the shape of a man for that purpose, and the incision made in it: then the operation in it is, according to what I have said: and it is, so that you insert the point in the root of the King from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another point where there is a double thread on the side of the eyelid, and let it penetrate: and then release the first one according to its disposition.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then incision of the place of the double thread, and bind with it the side of the King around the point: and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove it now, and place over the eye a wool dipped in theAlbugine (a substance exuded by the eye) : and release it, until the thread falls with the King.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the eye with it, which comforts it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the King is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth, until it adds to the eye an eminent  ( prominente) appearance.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a small spatula, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and moisture of Albugine  (a substance exuded by the eye) flows out, and the eye goes down, and enters immediately: then tighten it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Regarding the cure of Alcani.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness called Alcani, is not otherwise than a mucus that is gathered in the eye, similar to water flowing down, and it itself is not.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the way of acting in it is, so that you make the sick sit on a prepared seat, or face to face.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it, until you feel the sickness coming to the lower eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is bound, and does not fall down, and the light is closed: and let the sick person see things as they do; and if it does not fall down below, you should know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent is not prepared with blood for him as we have said, then make him sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spike and find with him above the corneous patch a little to the side of the connection with the corneous membrane on the crown, until the blood comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But when it has gone out, then distill into the eye hot water in which you mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fennel and honey; then take care of the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	As for the care of the water that comes out into the eye or a cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken about the kind of water, and which comes to pierce the saying and explaining, then take it again according to the health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands square, opposite to the light, near the sun; and bind the eye that has the water, and tighten it firmly: then palm the eyelid of the eye with your right hand, if the water is in the left eye, or with your left hand, if the water is in the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take almagre with your right hand, if the eye is on the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then put the end of the almagre near the crown by the thickness of the radius in the same white of the eye apparent tear; then push the almagre with force; and you roll it with him with your hand, until it penetrates into the albuginous of the eye; and you feel that the almagre has already come to the dry remedy.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that there be a measurement of the trip of the almagre to the depth, a space which is from the pupil to the end of blackness; and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the same pupil with an eye vision, because of the clarity of the corneous membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put the alum until the place where is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press the lower one with a force by another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then has come down water immediately, then sick will see it over that which opens its own wound immediately, and alum in its eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then you rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then has come down water, then put it again, except that it is discharged alum.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When then is formed, and does not rise up: then remove alum with ease: and you rub your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water some of the clear salt of the gem: and wash with it the inner eye.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put outside all the stubble, or wool wetted with oil and with the alba (a white substance), and bind it with it the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are our time, put on him ground of the triturated cumin mixed with alba (a white substance).
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	That if does not obey you alum to entrance in the eye for its hardness, because it is of a man, whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take the seed-oil, which is called Alberid, whose this is form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Then open it with it the same combination and not the last your hand into the orifice: and is not except that you do make a wound to the place of the alum soft.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce alum, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And near the end of your work, is prepared for the sick a bed unlit made, in which sleeps on his back in a dark house: and it is forbidden all movements, and a cough: and put food his that heals nature its: and does not move his head to the right, or at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And sits the ligature according to its disposition until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve it in that dark house, and experiment its force: and let see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligaments until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it should not be done at the time of treatment or immediately after the incision: but rather it should be done away from it; for the water rises quickly through the wiry face.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a fever occurs: then it is appropriate that you should open his eye before the seventh day; and straightened out, that which has been drawn should be put back into place until it is healed: then you can wash away his breath, and put him on his face where his breath comes from under for several days, while he is in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him go out of the house step by step, and turn around in his couches.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And you should know that the student is not exempt from fever sometimes: then he may dare to look at the work.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed one of those who are from Al-Rajah has come to us, who said, "It was done in Al-Rajah with a sharp needle, which sucks up water.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But it is not true that I have ever seen anyone in the land of the west who did this; nor does it appear in any of the old books: but it may be that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the shapes of the wounds from the wound, so that they stand on her who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from fine iron; and let their ends be with this same subtle triangle, and the sharp end.
Formae magda.	The shapes of the wound.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Regarding the care for a born nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Head 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When various meats grow in the nose, some of which is similar to the flesh of many feet; and from this is the flesh of cancer, stone-like, with a pale color; and from this is the soft flesh, not white-colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	So then, of these various meats that are in the nose, if there is any soft meat, not fraudulent or cancerous, you should make him sit with his hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and stick in hooks on those meats; and then pull them out from outside, and cut what you have caught with a sharp, fine hook until you are sure that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If something remains that cannot be cut off: then cut it with a slender instrument easily, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if blood is your master, or a fever occurs: then oppose it as necessary: or if it is a malignant apoplexy, then approach it with cauterization, until the blood is cut off, and all flesh is taken away.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then let it be applied to the nose after a cut with vinegar, or water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	But if the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate, as it should, then know that within it there is flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, to which an instrument does not reach with an incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary that you insert a thread of linen which has some thickness, and nodes many in it; and place between each node the quantity of a finger, or less: and let go the sick person, so that he lets fall one end of the thread into the nose with a beam, or with whatever can be done for him after he has done himself similar azur: and he should hold his sense of smell, until it reaches as far as the throat, and comes out on top of his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times this boy makes similar Atome in school: and it is a simple thing for him who wants to:
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, the end that comes out on top of the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then let the minister lock the flesh with the nodes that are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Let it be done until you know that the flesh is already with the nodes of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then remove the thread: and put in the nose after abstinence of blood licinium which you drank in Egyptian ointment: let it be done for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place at the end of the matter in the nose a cannula of lead, for several days until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If, however, the cure requires excision, then use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making a nose wash, with which to distil oil and other medicines into the nose, make it of silver or brass: that it be like a small lamp, opened like a shell: and its opening also.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed cannula, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making a nose wash should be full, and sealed: whose handle is at the back of it, which you hold when you heat oil or what you want to pour into it, and flowing substances.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the cure for a nosebleed:
Caput XXV.	Head 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	A nosebleed often arises in the far extreme of the nose, and becomes larger and more intense over days until it looks like a breach.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this, at the beginning of its appearance, you should cut off all of it with scissors.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place something hot or burning, or medicine that burns in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If, however, the cutting takes long to stop bleeding until it becomes larger, then wait, if it is hard and dark in colour and not very soft: then do not touch it with a iron bar: for it is a sign of cancer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For many times have I seen, who cut into the bone, and it has happened from that to a great evil on him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the apostema is gentle to the touch, not dark in colour, and you see that the cutting can be done throughout it, then wash the sick with water, and cut the whole of it without fear or trepidation: and cure the place along with it, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On suturing the nose, lips, and ears:
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know that when the continuity of a cartilage is broken, little operation can be performed on it unless in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when this has happened to someone, you should think that if it is a recent fracture with its blood: and then add the painful wound with a stitch: then take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	If the continuity of the solution has already separated and one is made healthy part: then it is necessary to remove all parts from its apparent skin, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then add the two lips with a stitch and tighten them, and sprinkle the wound with dragon's blood powder and Frankincense: and put above the powders a piece of plaster made firm, and something else from the consolidated plasters: and leave it tied for two days or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads separate by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of the stitch is that you add the solution of the continuity, or with acribus, as we have told you about the stitch of the eye: or you add the solution with a thread, as I made you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	§ On the Extraction of Knots from the Lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people have and in their inner lips there are often hard little lumps like grains of herbs: and some of them small, and some big.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore you should turn the lips over, and find on every knot, and hang it with a hook, and drop it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the cut has been cleaned up, until blood stops flowing.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then apply vinegar to it, and take care of the place with it, where the stain is, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	§ On the Cutting of the Meat from the Gummy.
Caput XXVIII.	Head XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	A lot of times a person's car comes out from under the gums, which the ancients called "abulus.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It should be suspended with a hook or held with tongs and dropped at the root and allowed to run out freely, or let the blood flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on a third place powder, or other astringent powder, dry it off.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that same car returns after cure, for it often does so again, then cut it a second time and cauterize it: it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Of the reasons for toothache with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Head XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When teeth are gathered together on the surface from within and from the outside part, and between the gums there are rough spots, spines, and sometimes they rot, and turn yellow, until this corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become rotten because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Then it should be so that the sick person sits between your hands, and his head in your lap, and cut out the gum and tooth where you see the roots, and anything like sand: until nothing remains of them, and similarly for the blackness, and yellowing, and sourness, and until they are completely clean.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If then that which is in them from the beginning of the cause is taken out, it is good: but if not, then cut them a second time on another day, and a third time, until you have reached the last study about it that you wish to do.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that the tooth is resistant to many different shapes of blades: for your own purpose, prepare the blade with which it will be cut from below, because the blade with which the tooth is cut between the teeth is different from the blade with which it is cut from below.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these shapes of blades are prepared for you, which you can see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Of the extraction of toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that one heal the tooth from its pain with all intelligence, and do not postpone the eradication of it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not that one should replace a tooth when it is eradicated: for the substance is subtle; until there is no excuse for the eradication of it, then it must be considered when the patient is weak to eradicate it, so that it hardens and is certified before you the đauing tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For many times the pain deceives the weak one, and he thinks that it is in the tooth and eradicates it himself: then the pain does not retreat until the tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	But when the tooth which is painful is certified before you, then it should be made to scarify around the tooth with a tweezers, in which there is some virtue; until it is opened from all sides: and then it should be moved with your fingers or with fine tweezers little by little, until it is raised.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then when you have good locations in it, and hold the wound between your knees: which you held well so that it does not move; and then pull the tooth after its straightness, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if it does not come out, then take some of these instruments, and push it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	But if the tooth is pierced or corroded: then it should be filled with cloth: and you should tighten it with a fine edge, so that it does not break at the time of your clamp on top of it with tweezers.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it should be necessary for you to understand how to do the scarification around the gum from all sides.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength, so that you do not break it, and remain a part of it, and returns to the weak one from the same maliciousness which is greater pain with it first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And be careful not to do what those who do phlebotomy do out of ignorance and their courage in eradicating it, except that they administer what we have said.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For often they bring about great ailments in men, which are more difficult to break than to heal, and leave behind all its roots or some of them: or take it out with some bones of the jaw: as we have often witnessed this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then let it be cleansed after the eradication of it with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	That if there should be a flow of blood from the places (for often it happens): then dry up something from the wound, and fill it with it: and if not, cauterize it if it does not give you relief.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shape of the forceps is narrow so that they may move within the first place, have long extremities, short handle, thick so that they do not double when pressed on a tooth: they are as you see the thick handles, until when you squeeze them together, they do not bite themselves, and do not double: the short extremities, and are made of bent iron, or of curved metal, directed extremities: and there are teeth in their extremities, some of which enter into some things, and squeeze with a constriction that is suitable, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when they are made as the shape of an ear-hole which is called ciconia, and are strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the eradication of teeth, and extraction of bones of the jaw fractures.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains after the eradication of a tooth which is broken, then you should put on the place with butter for one or two days, until it softens: then introduce into it a chisel or forceps, whose extremities are as the shape of an ear-hole which is called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	But this form is of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Are their extremities made as a wedge inside: or like a file.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If then he does not obey you at the exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you stop over the root, and remove all the flesh, and introduce the instrument which is called a small palanquin, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Cut short at the end, a little more than the bulk: and it should not be wetted, lest it break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If then the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, it should be helped with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	Form of the first triangular extremity, where there is some bulkiness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	Form of the thin triangular extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	And it is also held with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which have preceded in the text of the teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also sit the support with this instrument which resembles a large hook, of this form, triangular extremity turned over, in which there is some bulkiness, so that it does not break: and do not wet it.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many instruments for the teeth: and likewise the other instruments do not count, and the careful artisan finds out by himself the instrument itself according to what is signified to him of operation and diseases.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For from diseases there are various types of instruments which the ancients did not say, because of the diversity of their shapes.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the jaw breaks from a tooth, or from other bones of the mouth, or is putrid: then examine carefully on top of it at its own place with what belongs to him from instruments and forceps which I have mentioned in the extraction of the root, and help with these gestures, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let it be a little more of bulkiness in this way, so that it is tightened, or held with it the jaw, and does not move and push back, until it comes out the jaw: and restore the place with suitable medicines to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, there is decay in bone, then shave off that part from its decay and heal it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the superior teeth, more than the others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When the teeth do not set according to their natural course, they become decayed through that very form; and above all when this happens in women and girls, that is to say, young persons.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth has come in after another tooth and does not fit in place, or cannot be filed and trimmed, then remove it; but if it is joined to the next tooth, then cut it out with this instrument, whose form I now describe.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar in shape to a small chisel, and is made of iron, having an acute point.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cut be deep, so that you cut it out over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not move another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is exposed and has its own trimming: then trim it with a chisel made of iron, the form of which I now describe.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It is all made of iron, and its handle is small and sharp at the end, like a chisel with which they make holes; with this they trim the tooth little by little over many days with ease, so that it does not move any other teeth and falls out: then file it at the end with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If the tooth breaks a part and wounds the tongue: then it is necessary to trim it also, until its sharpness has been softened: and smooth it off, so that it does not wound the tongue or damage speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Of teeth retained with gold.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the anterior teeth are struck or shaken by an impact and do not hold on to it so as not to fall out: and they have not been relieved with stinging medicines, and the remedy does not help: then there is ingenuity in them, that they should hold on to a gold wire: for silver turns yellow and decays after a few days; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let it (the thread) be of average thickness in subtlety and crudeness according to the quantity that it takes between teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of retaining it is such that you take a thread and insert it between two healthy teeth: then you sew with its two extremities the thread between the teeth, or one, or more, until you reach with the thread up to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then you repeat the texture up to the part from which you began: and firmly hold your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it does not move at all: and let your constriction be where you squeeze the thread, next to the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then you cut off the ends of the thread that are excess: and collect both, and turn them around with a movement: and hide them between a healthy tooth and a tooth that is loose, so that it does not hurt the tongue: then let it be released so that it becomes less strict.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it comes undone, or gets caught, hold them with another thread, and let it stand with it for a long time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	This is the form of teeth, and the shape of retaining two healthy teeth and two teeth that are loose, as you see it.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And when it comes to the point that a single tooth falls out and returns to its place after a fall and remains there: and does not do this unless the artisan is careful, skilled, and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a bone is broken with a blow: and it becomes like the form of a tooth, and it is placed in its place, from which it receives support, and is held fast, as we have said: and remains, and abides with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the cutting of the tongue, and preventing one from speaking.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When this ligament that is under the tongue happens to be either natural, with which the human being is born, or accidental, from an arrow that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is, so that you open his mouth and expose his tongue; then cut the nerve ligament from its width until his tongue is freed from its grip.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is anything hard and knotty within him, and if he has a lump from the wound; then push into it with a hook, and cut it across its width until you hit the ligament, and free the knot.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be careful not to make a hole in the deep flesh, and cut the artery there, and let blood flow.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wash it with rose water or vinegar or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a plaster of linseed, which holds the injured in all night; so that it is not consolidated again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If there is any blood flow, then place on the spot a poultice.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if he wounds you with blood, then caustic the spot with a caustic substance suitable for it; and then care for him with the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Regarding extraction of the wound that forms under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 50
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When there is a small blister under the tongue that absorbs the little wound, keeping the tongue away from its natural function; and perhaps it gets bigger until the bone is filled.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is, to open the jaw from the sun: and examine the blister.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	But if you see it of a dark or black color, which is hard and the injured has no feeling: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	But if it declines towards whiteness and is moist: then push into it with a hook, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If you wound yourself with blood during your operation, then place on the spot a poultice, until the blood stops; and then return to your operation, until you have removed all of it.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then wash it with vinegar and salt: and treat that part in the manner suited to it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the treatment of abscesses in the amygdaloids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chaps. 36-37.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When abscesses occur between the cheeks, that is to say, in the glands which resemble abscesses and occur on the sides: these are called the two amygdaloids: when you consider the treatment of them along with what we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then examine.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If, however, the abscess is hard, red, and of little smell: then do not touch the thing with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if its color is red, and its root is thick: then do not touch the thing with iron, fearing that blood will flow, and besides, leave the thing, until it is well.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	Then either pierce it: or let it burst of itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if its color is white, round, and its root is fine: then the thing should be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation upon it is, that you should consider before the operation, whether if its abscess is hot and quiet, completed in its fullness, or is beginning to diminish a little: then therefore make the person sit in front of the sun, and place his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and let him take hold of it with his hands, and stroke his tongue down with an instrument, which has this form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass, that it be fine as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press it with the tongue, and it is shown to you, falling on your side: then take hold of a hook, and fasten it on the amygdaloids, and pull it out to the outside as much as you can, except that you drag some of the tunics with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, which has this form following.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is joined by ligatures: however its extremities are curved, so that the opening of each of them is on the opposite side acute: wherefore consider whether it is made of iron, or of a damp leather.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present then cut it with a chisel whose shape is like this one.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	But if it is acuter on one side and less acute on the other, then cut it at an angle from one side to the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one side of the mandible, cut the other side according to this same incision shape.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then afterwards rinse the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if he bleeds, rinse him with water in which you have boiled the peel of the fig tree or leaves of the myrtle and other such astringents until the bleeding stops: then treat the wound, until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when the phlegmon rises in the throat apart from the two glands,
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Then cut them according to what I have said in the incision of the two glands equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	I have myself already treated a woman with a phlegmon that had risen between her throat, which made her speech hoarse and nearly drowned her; she could breathe only through an opening made by me in the throat; she could eat nothing, nor drink any fluid, and she was close to death: if it had continued for one more day or two, she would have died.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the phlegmon had risen but a little, so that it had not covered the two holes of the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore hastened and fixed one of my scalpels in one of these holes.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and a large piece came away with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut off what was caught in the hole of the nose.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same for him at the other hole in the nose.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed on her tongue; and then I fixed my scalpel into the phlegmon; then I cut off a part of it, and there was very little blood; so that at once her throat was clear, and she began to drink, and afterwards she ate something.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	And so I didn't stop applying pressure to it for a long time; and the blister that was there would be replaced by another one that I applied pressure to, until it became too much and joined it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	And so I did some experimentation, and I cauterized the blister between the teeth.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood firm after the removal; then I walked away from it, and I don't know what God did with it afterwards.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the Blisters in the Mouth.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXVII. On the Blisters.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When a cold descends to the mouth, and blisters are formed, and they are large: then it is called the perpendicular one; and if it is on the lower part, round, then it is called a blister.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with the method we have described under Division, and there is no improvement; and you will see that the blister becomes cool because of it, and it is thin: then it should be pricked.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is gathered there is round, and it has no length, and it is bloody or dark in color, and it has no feeling: then it should be pricked with an incision.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in the blister is a fear of illness.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Then when you see it according to the manner I have described from its whiteness and length, let you sit the sick before the sun; and press his tongue with an instrument whose description came before: then fix a hook on the blister, and pull it down; and cut it with one or two instruments I have described in the incision of the two nostrils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not apply pressure to it, unless it is added to the natural boundary without any addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you apply pressure to it any more, you will damage speech and conversation.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use what I have described in the incision of the two nostrils; and take care of it, until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the sick person shudders because of the incision; then you should use your skill in cauterizing it without any fear or anxiety.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the mode of cauterization is not in it, except with sharp water; and it is, that you put the head of the wound in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press her tongue with the instrument which we have said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I have said you should take in the cauterizing chapter, and bind it with this extinguisher not extinguished, and put on it that is not thick or thin, and fill it with the concavity of this instrument, whose this is the shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Sit at the end of her where the medicine is placed, as is placed the concavity of the radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And put the instrument with the medicine on her wound: and the sick man sits lying on his side, so that salutary fluid flows from her mouth from the inner medicine, so that it does not flow down from it to her throat anything, and hurts her.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you take from it first half of the medicine on her wound after an hour, until you see it has turned bad, and to sit her gently with the medicine's bit.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you want to take from it your meal, and spread it out on the end of the radius, and pour the medicine into it, and insert the radius with the meal into a tube until it sticks to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Make it many times, until you get the result that you want about the cauterization's new.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let her go: for she will heal herself and falls after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	That if you want to take medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization wash her off with a new thing that is imbibed in butter, and clean with it what is in her circumference from the medicine: and let it rest with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And heal her outside with brooms, and inside with gargles, until she heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This then kind of cure is healthier than the incision, and longer in time from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the wound is also treated with a burn, which is finer than cautery and incision: it is treated with suffumigation in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	And some salt, and hyssop, and oregano, and rue, and sseah, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar plants: and all of them are gathered together, or some of them in a pot, and are soaked with vinegar and boiled: and the pot is covered with an unsteady cloth: and a hole is made in the middle of the pot, above which a sharp instrument is placed according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or brass: and the end, in which is the grain, should enter into the hole of the needle, until the vapor rises to the hole on the cane, until the wound is much darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat often on the same place until it heals.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And do not make this cure at the beginning of an eruption.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it adds something to the eruption: and you should not make this cure unless at the decline of the eruption's heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if you do not have this instrument with you, then take a cane, and put at its end some of the skin of an onion: so that it does not burn the hole in the needle: for the skin of onions prevents the vapor from burning the hole. And this is good cure when done with care.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Regarding the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Head XLVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a tooth remains stuck in the throat, or a fish's spine, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Then it is necessary that you extract what is apparent from them, which falls on the tongue when you press it with an instrument under the sun, and tell you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And if it does not show itself to you and is hidden in the throat, you should make a weak person sick before food digests in his stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps something that has stuck will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	He swallows a piece of rope, or the root of lettuce, or dry bread; or he takes a piece of sea sponge that is dry and soft: and he binds it with a thread, then swallows it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore he arrives at the place where are spines, or an oss, and is drawn out, then he walks away.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	But if he does not walk away with it as we have said: then use the instrument of lead in the form of this.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a radius of a little bit, and at the end let there be a slenderness, which he shall introduce into his throat with ease: and he shall hold his head raised up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of the touch of his epiglottis, lest it should happen to him to cough, and push forth with it a bone, or insert himself with the instrument in his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But that the sick one shall insert himself, that is better: for he knows well the place of the thing annexed thereto: and he shall push forth below, or shall take up his hand with the instrument above, all this according to the quantity which is prepared for him, till he walk away.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the extracting of blood.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When you are treating with the bloodsucker, and it does not give, then consider in the throat before the sun, or beside the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I have told you of.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	But if your yawn falls upon the bloodsucker, extract it with a little hook, or with subtle gestures on the side.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	But if it is not possible with them: then take a narrow tube, and insert it into the throat as far as the throat: then insert into the narrowness of the tube an iron that is ignited with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Make this many times over: and let the sick one abstain from all water during the day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full drink of cold water, and open his mouth therein: and let him close his mouth with it, and let him not swallow anything out of it: and let him move his hand with the water.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For when it feels water, it falls with ilium.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not leave when we tell it to, then let the sick person sit with lice, or with a moth, or with an instrument that we tell it to use for moth-killing.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because it will fall by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation is that you take a pot, in which there are licks with fire: and the pot is covered with a covering, and an opening is made in it; and the end of the instrument is placed in that opening.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the moth-killing, and let the sick person place his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that it does not leave the moth-kill; until you know that the moth-kill has come to bloodsucker.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For bloodsucker falls immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	Since if it does not fall, then repeat the moth-kill many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick person bear hunger, eat a sauce, and other things, and do not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	So it is necessary that it leaves with this regime.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument from which bloodsucker is taken out of the throat when it falls on that place of tickling.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is like a pair of tweezers, as you see: except that there is a groove that enters into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the opening of an ear, which is called a cicona, in which there is a roughness like a file; and when it grasps anything, does not let go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Regarding the opening of the aphes and its sectioning, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Head 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	The species of aphes are many, and many in regard to their memory, that is one, and one in this book: they differ in the perforation of them, and in the sectioning of them from two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of these species of aphes is found in itself, and because it grasps by moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is for places where the injury has come from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For the injury that occurs in the head is different from the injury that occurs in the anus; and the injury that occurs in the flesh is different from the injury that occurs in the joints; and each has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of the scabs there are which do not need to be pierced, unless they have dried up blood in them and their completion; and from those there are which need to be pierced when they are raw and have not completed their growth.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As the scabs that are next to the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when the injury occurs near a joint and is prolonged, until what is putrefied in its circumference perhaps the ligaments corrode or the nerves of that joint: so it is the cause of closer contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or is an injury in a main member; for if you delay piercing it until it has healed, it will hurt or damage that main member or the body through that main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or is near a member; then pierce it when immature: and do not need to pierce the raw injury, not complete digestion, unless it is near a member so that it does not putrefy inside, and lengthens towards the center of the loins, and becomes a fistula, or forms in the term (of that member) that it does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time for piercing the wound; since it has healed according to its complement; and is at rest from pain, retreat from fever, decrease of redness, and pulse, and sharpness in the head wound; and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same piercing in the lower places of the wound; and let the piercing be straight along the length of the body, if the wounds are in the hands and feet, and the places of the wrist, and the strings, and nerves, and arteries, and to the last in all equal places, where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that reflect, go with a second incision in that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When, however, the ecchymose is in fleshy places: then it is better that you should desist from piercing it, until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said, according to the second supplement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus from it will be prolonged; and it is full of secretions and putridity, and perhaps its lips will become thick, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some ecchemoses are pierced according to the width of the body when in need: or according to that which is lacking in the limb.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small incision in little ecchymoses and a wide incision in big ecchymoses: or several incisions according to the similarity of the size of the ecchymoses.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are ecchymoses in which the skin must be closed: and an incision is made when it is already formed like a cloth, and in the border, because it has already died: such as happened to many, for instance, like a blister, and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are those that heal by means of an incision having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And one of them is that in which the incision is made like a fig leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As in an ecchymose of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And one of them is that in which a round incision is administered, and a lunar one: and similar ones from incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That, however, in which there is no head, such as are the superficial ecchymoses, it is necessary that you pierce it with a superficial incision, or merely flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary that, when the ecchymosis is gross and has already collected a lot of serum, you pierce it so that it does not run out and pour all of it out at once: however, you extract a part from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then cover the ecchymosis until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Let us test this many times according to the degree, until it is gone out: above all if he is weak in strength, or a woman pregnant, or a boy newborn, or an old man decrepitous: for the animal spirit of the animal is separated from him many times when he is going out of the blood: and perhaps the weak dies, and you do not feel it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore let us be very careful with this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have made the wound, as these wounds are made, it is necessary that you wash with water: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If then is a small wound-scab, or is a flat cut, then give him a liniment of old linen, or an ancient cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a large wound-scab, and there are many holes from the cut, then at that time let you put liniment into all the holes, until they close up together.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin in the wound, or have made it round: then let you fill it with old cloth, or as when the fabric is smooth, or is rubbed with linen-flour without moisture: and bind him tightly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then let you throw it off, and take care of that with him what needs to be done from the ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if there should be a flow of blood in the hour of your operation, then give him cold water and vinegar, after he has soaked it up with a cloth: and let you put it on the place of the flow of blood many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if that blood flow persists, then you shall give medicine, and cure, and powders, which I tell in many places of our book here, and from a division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the time of winter, and the place of the wound has many nerves: then you shall pour powders with wine, and hot oil: and let you put them on the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the summer, and the places are fatty: then you shall put powders that are soaked up in water, and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that is cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day of his death, as we have said, then it is necessary that you should untie the poultice, and wipe him clean, and administer to him what is appropriate for his cure, until he is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the cure of poultices generally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the half of the distinction, I have already spoken about all poultices, how it is a way to cure it individually specifically.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	About the sections of poultices that happen on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Head 31.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Little poultices happen on the skin of the head, and they are of two species: Nodules, which are enclosed in tunica, which are sacs; almost as if they were hen's eggs.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many species of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	There are some that are thin; and there are those that contain a moisture similar to lime: and there are those that contain a moisture similar to flour and poultices: and those that are like them, and among those there are, which are hard stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all of them, and their extraction is not fear, when it is near their section does not make opposition of arteries.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation on their sections is, as you experience it with the instrument, whose form came after this, which is called Intramuscular, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if that is what contains moisture, then make dry yourself with the second section according to the length of the superficial section: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the second section from line B to line G. And when the moisture is emptied, then scrape the skin which contains that moisture, and do not leave anything inside it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For many times if there remains something of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then submerge the poultice in Egyptian ointment if it is present, and if not, in water and salt: and fill it with the ointment and leave it until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For this reason, it rusted because what was left over from the jar.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then, one should pound the wood again with Egyptian ointment, second and third time, and if you are satisfied with it, until you trust that nothing has remained in the jar, then, indeed, take care of the wound with ointment, until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a big lump: then dry out the wood according to this form, having the form of the cross: and throw away the hooks between the clefts of the section, and scrape off the wood from all parts: and test your skill in extracting the skin which contains the wood.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if the opposite causes you pain, then do as I will tell you after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do likewise in an abscess, if it is stone-like, from the section, and the same cure, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section on a stone-like abscess is easier: for there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these abscesses in the head of some men, where there is no depth of moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I followed over an abscess in the head of a married woman, and I found an abscess like a solid stone, hard, white, which could not be broken: and if it was struck by anything, it would wound the wood.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in other head abscesses, besides these that we have said, which happen in the heads of boys, and near the roots of the ears, all sections of them are superficial sections.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or put a hole in them always from their lower part, so that the flow of blood goes to the lower side.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then take care of them with what comes to them from the cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Regarding the section of Struggles in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often happen in the neck, and under the ribs, and in the groin: and sometimes they happen all over the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And above those which happen to them in the neck, there is one and many; and they issue from a side; and all strophula come out of them within their own tunic, as it is in the knots and aphes of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of strophula are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For from them are the leaflets; and from them are those which contain moisture; and from them are the evil ones, which do not submit to cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Now in that part from which you see a good color in touch, whose skin is close and moves to all parts, and does not adhere to the nerves of the neck, nor to the arteries, nor is deep: it is necessary that you separate it from the superficial line from the upper part to the lower part of the body according to a line, g. and scrape it off from all sides: and extend two skin flaps with a hook, or with many hooks if you can bear it, as we have said in the aphes of the head, and draw them out slowly.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is necessary that you take care that the new blood does not flow or that a nerve is injured.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the scalpel not be too sharp and keen so that it does not hurt you with its touch, or cause to shake your hand, or fall down, and fall into something that is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein or an artery, or prevents you from operating, then place on the wound dried hay tricum, or some powder which stops the blood, and tighten the hay, and let it go, until the sharpness of the aphes subsides, and the hay softens: or it may begin to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is cut off by the bandages; so turn back to your work, until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine with your index finger if there is anything left of the strophula by the small ones; then cut them, and clean them up.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	For if there is a large new strophula in the root: then it is necessary that you do not cut that strophula from its root; but it is necessary that you tie it with a strong twisted thread, and let it go until it falls by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cloth, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for the wound itself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire tendon is injured, then you should bring together two wounds: and immediately when you see that there is no excess, mend them.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is excess due to the size of the tendon, then you should cut into the root of it and remove it: and administer the stitch that we have described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And as for the tendons that contain moisture, pierce them with a superficial puncture: so that you can see the location of maturity of the tendon: and place the puncture from there down along the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then after the puncture administer a liniment with ointment, and similar things, so that it corrods what remains of corruption, until when you see that the tendon is now healed: then care for it with a generous ointment made from flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	As for the section of the epiglottis behind the apexy within the throat by accident.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLI.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancient ones called this section of the epiglottis and there was no one in our land who made it; and this is the writing of their teaching.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But in those who have a synechieu (a kind of joint), the epiglottis should be removed: for there is no advantage to it: since all the nerves and the lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those, however, who have a hot aphemia(a kind of swelling) in the mouth, or throat, or in both amygdalas, when there is no disease in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis, so as to escape from the destruction which happens through precation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore when we wish to remove the epiglottis, let us cut it with a little circle of the epiglottis, or four, at a width, that is situated between two circles by a quantity, that is the section in the sifilis(a kind of skin disease), not in the cartilage: and this place is suitable for the section, since it is hidden from the flesh, and the blood vessels come from it, far away.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then he should spread the skin with glue and a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he will find the skin, until it reaches the canal; he must stop the flow of blood if he sees any blood there.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then dry up the wound with a sponge that we have provided: and indicate on the section of the canal the exit from it when it is moved away, and by the loss of blood.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And release the loose end at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When, therefore, the wound is moved away from the time when there is a fear of an inflammation, the two lips of the wound will be gathered together and sewed up alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that make meat grow, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	Says Albucasis. The summary of this speech that we have related is an explanation as to when the poultices should be removed, for the disease will have passed its height when the mouth has been covered with pus and the sick person is rescued from death, and he will recover from his illness if he breathed in a certain way, and he will be saved from death. And for this reason they ordered to leave the loose end alone until the evil of the illness is gone, and it is almost gone: then they ordered to tighten the wound, and to take care of him, until he is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And this that I saw with my own eyes, is that a servant girl took a knife and put it in her mouth, and cut it with the blade on the side of the lung canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to cure her, and I found her moaning, as a dead person moans.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I then removed the loose end, and I found blood flowing out from the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Then I was confident that she had not cut her ligature, nor had it come loose: and wind flowed out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	So I healed the broken bone and the injury itself, until he was well; and nothing happened to the servant except a sore throat, and after a few days she recovered her good health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	That is why I say that there is no fear in the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Concerning the hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This swelling called a throat hernia is a large one, of the color of the body; and it is common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it has two causes: or it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly there is no talent in the natural.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one, however, has two causes; one of which is similar to the nodules that are swollen; and the other is...
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to a swelling that is caused by an enlargement of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is a fear in it; and you should not suppose that it should be done with iron unless it is small, but you should test it and examine it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If, then, the swelling is similar to a large nodule, and it is not suspended with any vessels: then cut it off as you cut off nodules; and take it out with what contains it in a pouch, if it is in a pouch; and if not, then examine it all over.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with him, so that he may heal well, until he recovers his health.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Concerning the section above the kinds of nodules.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XL.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodules, and I have already spoken about their division; and it is necessary that I should describe the difference between a nodule and an inflammation, since there is doubt in the matter.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say, then, that with inflammation there is heat, and fever, and sharp pains, until the excess fluid is dried up, and decay is completed; for then the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When the node is not hot, nor feverish, nor painful, and it will contain them kistis sifachin, which is their own sacs, and will be according to the color of the body: and is an obstacle to them such as chickpeas, and becomes like a plate, and greater and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two species: or thin: or contain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to cure the node, you should experience it, and inquire about it with the instrument called Intromissum, according to which its form will be in the chapter that is after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiry about pustules and all nods is, that you take this instrument, and introduce it into a moist place, which you will find in the pustule: and you shall move your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has entered the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then take your last hand according to the measure of the size of the pustule.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then remove Intromissum, and consider what comes out of his opening into the groove.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If so then if moistness comes out running, whatever color it is: then dry the instrument by a superficial section, according to what I said in other pustules.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture comes out in the groove of Intromissum, then you will know that it is fatty: so dry over the node with a section having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you: and suspend it with a hook, and scrape the skin from all parts with ease: and guard the chestnet if you can over it, so that you take out the sound one with the Node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the chestnet is broken during the operation, and it is not possible to take out the sound one, often happens that it, then take it out roughly, until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if there remains of it a little bit, or a lot, the Node will return according to many.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If he hurts you, and there remains a little of the wound: then fill the wound with some acute corrosive powder; and bind it closely, and put above it what is called a hot poultice; and take care of it with the rest of the cure until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If there is therefore a large nodule, then cut off its two lips and take care of it with what is called the flesh-eating substance.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if you have an opposite fresh pustule, or not a pustule: then wrap it up, and fill the place with dried土, and leave it tightly tied for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies, and the discharge ceases: then proceed to cut off what remains of the nodule.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Regarding instruments from outside the body for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVII.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Of these are the forms of introducers, which are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For from them there is a large one, and from them a medium one, and from them a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let there be made of iron four-sided prisms with inclined ends, that they may facilitate entrance into the incision.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	These are forms of experimenters, and the number is four; that is to say, piercing; and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For from them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are convenient that they may be examined through the incisions, exits, fistulas, and abscesses from him who is lying there between the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, sharp, smooth, such as the large aiguilles used for sewing up wounds; they are of brass, or copper, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better ones are those made of brass.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And there are experimenters made of black lead, which are convenient for examining fistulas; and they have reflections, so that they may reflect with their softness on the parts examined.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For from them there are long ones, from them there are middle-sized ones, and from them there are short ones, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and the strictness of its estreety.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	Form of the anastomosis, and there are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For from them there are simple ones, that is to say, those in which there is one width: and they are of three species as you see, Great, Middle, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them there are blind anastomoses: and they are of three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them there are hooks having two widths, and they are of three species: and from them there are hooks having three widths, and they are of three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpel with which they cut and scrape nodules and staples: and they are of three species: for from them there is a great one, a middle one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which the cutting is done are acute, other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed so except when it is done with them that the incision into the skin, or nerve, heals by itself, and finds a little calm from the inflammation than it finds in the scaring of staples.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are called Magda, and they are species of three.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of brass, and they are similar to the radio with which alcohol is prepared: and in the broad end there is a hidden spikelet: and it runs into the inside, and out when you want it, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	Form of the spikelets which are hidden between the fingers at the perforation of staples: and they do not feel them, when they are touched; and they are of three species, a great one, a middle one, and a small one.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Form of the wind-pockets with which blood is separated from the wound: and they are of three species, a great one, a middle one, and a small one.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of brass or copper, round, of about the same length as you see, and let them be fine.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it should be that these shapes of the vents are great and small with you: so that you can cut blood away with speed when necessary, and then when there is no medicine present with you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them to cut blood in any part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the legs, hips, arms, breasts, feet, groin, and similar places from the flesh, damp.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And when they are made into small tools like the fists of a gloved hand, according to their shape: by which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or when incision is made in a vein or artery: and when they are also made into rounds according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Regarding the care of the breasts of men who resemble female breasts.
Caput XLVII.	THE SURGERY OF THE Breasts.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the breasts of some men swell at night (that is, when they begin to feel the desire to urinate in their sleep) until they resemble female breasts: and remain wet with urine.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever desires to avoid this (that is, the desire to urinate in his sleep), let him tie his breast with a moon-shaped piece of cloth, according to this form from the line, b to the line, g: and then scrub the whole skin off.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill it with a medicated ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join together the two lips of the wound with a stitch, and care for it, until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the breast sways towards the lower side and becomes soft because of its size, as is the case with women: then it should be found in its two upper sides with two lunar-shaped pieces, each held by the other at its ends, so that the larger one is contained within the smaller one, according to this form from the line, b to the line, g: and then scrub the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the pudding, and administer what we have said about the stitch and powders, which is necessary for the cure, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not want to make the incision necessary for you to make, due to the patient's restlessness, or due to the flow of blood: then you should fill the wound with a corrosive ointment and leave it alone until it has corroded what remains from the swelling.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Regarding the abscess that occurred during the expedition of Titus.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 58.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses that occur during the campaign of Titus are of two types: one is hard and contains pus, and the other is moist.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	So these that contain moisture should be cleaned with a lunar section, according to this shape, from line B to line G. And when all that is in the abscess has been washed out with sweat, then fill it with old ointment and leave it alone until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the ointment should be removed, and care taken with the ointment suitable for that wound, until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the type of nodules of the strophula, then cut over it like we said in the section about strophulas that are equal.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	But if the node is extended in this way so as to emit pus, then administer cauterization to it, according to what we said in that which was pre-empted.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Regarding the incision of an abscess that has occurred due to an artery or vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is interrupted and the skin that is above it consolidates, then many times a boil occurs from there; and also occurs to veins, so that a boil and swelling occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs with which it is recognized that an abscess and swelling are due to an artery and vein are these: for when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long and collected in the depths of the body; and when you press on the fingers of your hand, you feel almost as if there were a hissing sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is for the vein, is round in the apparent body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section on this ulcer is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and on the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is great indeed.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, so that his care may be taken away with iron, and that which is also from it in the extremities, or in the head, let it be taken away.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	And on this, then, what is from it by swelling of the opening of an artery, find in the skin by a section in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with a hook, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is detected.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert beneath it the hook, and let it penetrate until another side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place, which is between the two ligaments with a needle, until all the blood which is in it has gone out, and the ulcer is healed over.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure which produces pus, until the ligaments fall: afterwards care for that with ointments suitable for it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If the ulcer is due to a vein section, then you must hold your hand so that it is possible for you to extract it from the ulcer with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a hook under the place which you held with your hand, and let it penetrate: and let it remain in it a double thread, until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind the ulcer with that good ligament: according as I told you in the binding of an ulcer, from the two parts with its two extremities with a thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you think that the thread should be extracted, then insert a hook with another thread under the ulcer completely by the incision of the knife: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry out the abscess in the middle of it until you see what is inside: then make an incision on top of the skin, and free what is bound up from within it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on the pulp over it that you dipped in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure, which is done with liniments and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	The abscess that happened from a twist of the nerves.
Caput L.	Head
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As has happened with an abscess in an artery or vein, so too has happened with an abscess in a nerve: it is due to a blow, or due to excessive work, and the like: and it often happens in places of aid, or of a calcaneal joint, and in any place where joints move: and it is a gray abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It is similar in color to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is stretched with a wince, it feels in it a similar numbing.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And this is not an abscess aggregated deep inside the body, but rather it is under the skin, and it moves all over, and does not make a noise either forward or backward, nor backward towards the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	So then what is in the joints does not need to be moved with an iron wisp.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps, indeed, it happens that a contraction occurs.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which is from them in the head, or in the forehead, find skin with a smoothening.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If then there is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if there is a big one, then hang it from a hook, and scrape it off: then remove it, and join a stump with a stitch: and cure the abscess, until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the cutting of abscesses, which happens in the belly.
Caput LI.	Head
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Such a condition sometimes occurs often in the intestines and other parts of their bodies, which are called Tinea, because they are similar to lice in their likeness to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	For its root is subtle, and their head is thick, and their lips are loose.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And of them is one who is small, and of them is one who is very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I have seen a man already; and in his belly were two kind of things, which were more than like to other things which are fungis: there was no difference between them, they had white roots, and their lips were loose, and they drooped, and there ran out from them always moisture.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	So I laid hold upon them, and found in weight one as much as X and VIII ounces, and in another as much as VI ounces. And the operation in cutting them is, that you consider then, if it is weak, moist, and the color of the roots is white, moist, subtile: then cut him with a broad chisel, and let the cauterium be present before you in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often is cast out by section of it much blood: approach then if blood captivates thee, then cauterize him.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	That if you see a weak and fearful man who is afraid of the incision with the iron, then take a wire made from copper which is made slightly curved, and bind it to him with a thong: whose manner is that which I have said, and let go of him for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add in the tightening of the brass.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	So do not cease to tighten the brass, when it presses upon the flesh, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without work.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the roots of the flesh are thick, then there is some fear and terror in cutting him: especially for it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, possibly you can cut a half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize him, that he not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the flesh, until it is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not suspect to cut that flesh which is of a dark color, of few senses, and of an appetizing appearance: for it is an ulcerous cancer: and I come with the remembrance of the cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of an eminence of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII. On the treatment of an eminence of the umbil
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	There are many causes of an eminence of the umbilical area.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	It may arise from a fistula running below the belly, or from an outbreak of pus, or from the intestines, according to whether it occurs in the remaining ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood which flows from a vein, or from an artery, as has been said above.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from a constricted windpipe in that area.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	But if it is due to a fistula running below the belly, and the discharge is thick: then it is of the color of a blood clot, similar in color to the body; and it is soft, without pain, and seems to be of various depth.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the ejection of the intestines, then its position is with what we have described above, and its variety is more pronounced.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	But when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden: but then it returns, and there may be a sound with it; and it increases greatly at the entrance of the belly, and causes pain and trembling.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if it is due to moisture, it is soft; then it does not disappear when pressed with your hand, and does not become tighter, and is not added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	But if it is due to blood, then, with these signs, there appears a clot toward the dark edge.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is due to born flesh: then it is a grayish, thick, hard clot, and its shape depends on the quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	But if it is due to a windflow, then the touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation for it is this: if you wish to treat it, then you should refrain from treating it, since, if it is due to the blood of an artery or vein or a windflow, the treatment is not to be attempted.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that there is fear and horror, as I taught you in the chapter where I said that clots are due to an artery or vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the eminence of the umbilicus is due to the intestine, or the navel: then you should order the sick person to hold his breath and stand still, with his arms extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then, if there is a mark around the umbilicus, burn it completely.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then order him to lie down on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then, with a blade of steel, cut around the umbilicus from the spot you marked with the burning.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then, spread the middle part of the wound from above with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it strongly around the wound with a strong thread, or with a silken cord that is well knotted; and let the knot be well secured by the stretching of the bandage.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle part of the wound that has been spread above the knot.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you then find that he has already been caught by the knot: then remove the knotted part and introduce your finger into him, pushing the intestines towards the inside of his abdomen: and if you find a navel, then take hold of it with a hook and cut off the excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, the opposite artery is on your right or left: then tie him around very tightly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two sharp needles and insert two strong strings into them: and introduce two needles into the wound that you have made around the umbilicus in the shape of a cross, so that they penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the wound on all four sides around the needles; and if you want to, remove the needles, and let the place where the wound was be allowed to rot: or cut it open when it has become a little rotten: or cut it open when it is slightly rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him with ointment, as necessary, until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the eminence of the umbilicus is due to flesh that has become inflamed or moist: then you should close up the wound, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out any blood or moisture that you find in him.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for himself with regard to the solidification of the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	THE CURE OF CANCER.
Caput LIII.	Head LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	I have now finished with the division of the species of Cancer, and how it should be treated with medicines; and forbearance from treating it with iron, lest it should ulcerate; and I have spoken of cancer which is generated in the womb, and forbearance also in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	The ancients also say that whenever cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated, as for example in the breast or in the thigh, and in other such parts of the body which lie outside and can be completely taken away, it should be removed especially when it is only just beginning to form.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When however it has become old and great, it should not be approached near.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I was not able to cure any from it; nor did I see anyone before me who had done so.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is situated as we have said, is this: first of all you make an incision and drain the pus which is black.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then, if the wound is filled with a visible pus, you should bleed the patient; then, after he has recovered from the bleeding, administer the medicine.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick one by means of preparation when the operation is performed.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw on the cancer those hooks which are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then cover the whole of it with a paste, after having examined it, until not a single root remains; and let the blood flow freely, and do not cut it off quickly, but rather press the spots and wipe away the gross blood with your hand or with whatever instrument is at hand.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however the blood flow from the incision of an artery or a vein opposes you, then burn away the vein, until the blood stops flowing.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for himself with regard to the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	THE CURE OF HYDROPSY.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already discussed the different species of hydrophobia and how water is formed; we shall now examine the various forms of the disease and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those that are treated with iron, there is only one type of ochlosis; and it does not approach iron for the species of ear- disease: nor for the hyposarcous species, for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of hydrophobia with medicines and your treatment has not been successful, then reflect.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient is already weak, or there is another kind of weakness besides hydrophobia; such as a cough, or a watery eyes, and such like: then do not treat with iron: for there is a fear of that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see that the patient is weak of vigor, and there is no other illness besides hydrophobia; and he is not a boy or an old man: then the mode of operation in him is, so that you stand with your hands near his head, and let him express water from his hand towards the lower part of the pallet.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a small and sharp spatula: it should be shaped like this.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It should have two acute ends, one long, and the other acute, like a small spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	But there should be something smooth on it little by little, so that it does not cut during the operation towards the intestines and injures him:
Deinde considera.	Then reflect.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of hydrophobia is from the lower part of the intestines, then it is necessary to extend with a section of three fingers' length from the navel towards the lower side of the pallet.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the generation of hydrophobia is due to liver illness; then your section should be left from the navel by three fingers' length.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is due to the spleen; then your section should be on the right side: and it is not necessary that you also make a section on the side where the sick one lies, so that there do not flow too many secretions into that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with the instrument all the skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce the knife into it, and rub your hand with the chisel between the skin, and scrape, as if you were cleaning it up: and let the amount that is scraped be equal to the quantity of the nail, or about it.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce with the chisel until the knife reaches a vacant spot: and there is a spot of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then pull out the flesh, and introduce into the opening the instrument, which has this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or brass, or gold, or lead, or tin: and in its lower part there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side: and its end is cut according to the shape of the knife, as you see: at its upper end there is an annulus.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches water, it immediately goes down on top of the instrument, therefore it dries out from water at an average rate.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Since if you drain it more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps a weak person will die by the resolution of his animal spirit: or it may happen to him that he has a fit that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But drain it out according to the strength of its power, and according to what I tell you about the dispositions of nurses from its pulsation, and from its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then pull out the instrument, and keep the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it retains immediately due to the skin that holds back the opening that is above the chisel: so that I tell you, that you pierce it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the other side, if you see that it is weak in tolerating that thing: and pull out also from water a small quantity.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do that for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there is not much left of the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are healing a weak person, and you let go of a large amount of water: then guard that person with burial in hot sand, and with much sweating in a bath and in the sun, and let it wait on its hunger: and cauterize above the stomach, and the entrails, and the spleen after extraction of the water: following which I will tell you in advance.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the care for infants who are born with their bladders not punctured.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50. On the treatment of infants that are
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any infant is born from the womb of its mother and its scrotum is not punctured or has a narrow opening or is in an odd place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, it is necessary to help with the perforation as soon as he is born, with a delicate towel, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put a small clamp from lead into the opening and tie it: and hold him for three days or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When he then wants to emit urine, remove it, and let it go.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce the child.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead on, it is possible that the urine which runs over the place does not allow the child to be closed.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But this one whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it widens.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those who have an opening in an odd place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because from those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis: so he cannot urinate in front, until he raises his penis with his hand towards the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is no generation for him, therefore semen cannot reach the mother's womb according to its straightness: and it is a foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of action in that is, so that he lies on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the penis of him with your left hand by a strong extension, and cut the head of the penis from an edge, or with a sharp knife: as if you were cutting a cane, or like you are cutting something, so that it is similar to the head of the penis: and let the opening fall in the middle according to what should be.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And cause yourself during your operation to have no blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, he did not go with him when he cut off his blood and tended to the wound until it healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Regarding the lesions that occur on the foreskin and skull, as well as greasiness, blackening, and adhesions.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI: On the treatment of phimosis and other conditions of
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	regarding various problems that occur on the penis; there is an eminence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it come other evil things and others are not evil.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, you should hang it with a fine hook and cut it off completely until it is clean all around.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place on top of it a container submerged in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with dyachydin ointment after that until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the albather is evil and of a foul color, then you should administer cauterization on it after making an incision and shaving it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the albather is caught in the foreskin and is not circumcised, and there is a part of the albather inside the foreskin and another outside: then you should remove the albather that is inside first, until it hardens completely, then care for the one that is outside: for if you care for it at the same time, the foreskin does not heal.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And also happen other things in the testicles and darkening and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you should put together everything that has become dark and what wants to be corrupted, or what has already been corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then spread a line of honey over the wound that has already been crushed with flour and bread crumbs and dried herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remainder of the curing process until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, blood flow occurs, then administer cauterization with lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cauterization is suitable for two things at the same time, namely for the blood flow and the wound when it corrupts.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the penis is corroded and destroyed in an instant: then it is necessary that you introduce a plug made of lead into the meatus so that the sick person can urinate on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	Indeed, if the foreskin sticks to the head of the penis and this adhesion does not occur unless the foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required on it, and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or hematoma: then it should be cut with an dull pin until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is released from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to discern it with care, then you should cut some of the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is because the foreskin is easily punctured due to its slenderness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a soft cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with wine containing iron, until it heals.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the purification of infants and the treatment of errors or accidents.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution to continence, like the rest of the wounds: however, since it is the result of our operation, our desire, and its use is in boys on their own, it is necessary that we mark this operation as better, and always easier leading to salvation.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I therefore say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experimentation.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is because I have discovered most of the arts, and the use of scalpel and scissors in purification, circumcising with a sharp blade, and tying with wire and cutting with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I have already tested all these methods, and I did not find anything better than purification with scissors and wire binding.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For when the wound is cleaned, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Since the skin of the prepuce has two coats: so perhaps the upper coat may be torn, and the lower coat may be left intact: it is therefore necessary to cut into the second, so that the pain might not be felt.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when the cleaning which is made by the finger, that is to say, the digit, where surgeons operate, does not secure an incision at the extremities of the male member: since perhaps it enters into its hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In the cleaning done with the nail, perhaps it will scratch the iron, and ruin your operation; and since the skin of the boy is short by nature, and often grows so that it does not need to be cleaned: and I have seen this myself.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But the cleaning done with forceps and thread, a good experiment has shown to me; because the forceps are proportional to the incision: since the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When you squeeze your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate, and they make an incision of one kind at one time: and it is a compression of the same figure, containing the skin of the penis from all sides, so that there falls no error at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of operation is your own, so that you can cut off, especially the boy, if he is one of those who understand only a little, which you do not do, unless you tie the thread to his penis alone: and you leave him until the next day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then let him be happy and rejoice in every way possible for you, since he receives his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then let him stand between your hands prepared to stand, and not sitting down: and hide the forceps in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that he does not see them at all, nor any of the tools.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then introduce your hand into his penis, and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the penis comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from that which has been gathered there of filthiness.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind up the place marked with thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, bind the lower part with a ligature about half as thick as the first.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then grasp it with your thumb between the two ligatures and cut through both with your knife.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then wipe away the blood quickly with a cloth, and pull out the head of the blade.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow little by little (for this is best) and place the powder above: and above the powder, a cloth in which the thread is spread out, washed with rosewater mixed with fresh oil: and leave it on top until another day: and tend to the wound with further care until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the forceps for cleaning is like this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	The two ends should be bent and meet together: let no sprig of the claw project from it: and the length of the two curved parts should be equal to the length of the two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But a slip during cleaning is error: for perhaps it omits all the inner skin, or part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore you should extend it from your hand with your nail before touching the place: and cut it to length according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your nail, then take it with a forceps and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If however it has passed three days, and what is left under the swelled skin is raw flesh, then let go of it until the heat has subsided, and with ease, remove the flesh, cut it according to your preparation, and sew up for you from the head of the blade.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	So take care that the wound is covered with powder, which we described in the book on powders: and if it has incised above the line, and extends upwards, it does not harm it either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	So treat that injury with what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the Extraction of a Retained Bone from an Arrow Wound.
Caput LVIII.	Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus,
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The treatment for the retention of urine in an arrow wound, is that mentioned above, which we have described, until it is cured.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	If the urine does not become cured, and there is a stone in the urethra, which has now reached the neck of the bladder: then the patient should be bedridden, treated with care.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then he should put his feet on his back, and stretch his belly from the upper part of his back, and the patient should try to hold his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	So the patient is placed with his neck towards the rear, in order to expel the stone; from which it follows that the urine is cured.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it does not become cured with what we have said above, and the patient is ill: then you should administer the extraction of it with an instrument called a syringe, which has this shape; made of silver, and fine, soft, smooth as a bird's feather in its thinness, long like the palm of a hand, and in the middle: to which there is a fine cannula at the tip.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of exit for urine through it, is that you should take a double thread, and tie the end with wool, or twine, a good knot: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if there is any excess of wool, really insert into the cannula with care, as you would raise it.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then insert the syringe with oil, or with butter, and with alum; and make the patient sit on a chair, and dip the bladder, and his penis with wet oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the base of the bladder.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then cut twice from above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside until it reaches the bladder, and let him feel that he has already arrived at the empty place: and do not make this second order unless the meatus, in which you put it, is where the curvature is.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then slowly extend the string with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the thread follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then take it out and let the thread run through the urethra: and again push the syringe, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied, and let him feel a relief of pain.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	As for the quality of catheterizing the bladder with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a wound happens in the bladder, or blood freezes inside it, or pus is accumulated inside it, and water and medicines are distilled inside it: then make use of an instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is closed, that is, shut.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you see them.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concaved place, where the push is located, should be according to the quantity that it gets without addition, until when it is taken away with it something is attracted from the humidity: and when it is pushed, it expels it far away: second, because it makes a clepsydra, which pours out naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battles of war.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When you pour water into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the clepsydra into the water, and pull it out with what pushes it upwards, for the water is drawn into the concaved part of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the extremity into the penis, according to what we have said about the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push the water with it, for that water reaches the bladder immediately, so that he feels a relief of pain.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	To form a thin cloth so that it is wound about the urethra.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or brass; let its head be higher than the corresponding alcama with a small ligament beneath it, by which the urethra is covered.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the urethra of a ram, and place it in it the moisture with which you want to cauterize the urethra.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two sinuses with a strong ligament and a double thread; and heat it a little more over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the end of the cloth into the penis, and then grasp your hand over the urethra with the moisture being tightened, until the sick person feels that the moisture has already reached the urethra.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have the present urethra, then take a piece of pergament and make it into a circle, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread into these holes, as they turn.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle together, as is gathered also the wool; then you put into it that which you want of moisture, and of oils, and of water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it in the instrument; and do with it as you did with the urethra by means of your hand, until the moisture has reached the urethra.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	§ On the extraction of stone.
Caput LX.	10.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of stone, and its treatment with medicines; and we have distinguished between stone generated in the kidneys, urethra, and other parts, and also between that which is formed in the bladder with the hand and section; but this stone which is generated in the urethra is especially called "stone in the urethra"; and this stone which is generated in the penis is called "stone in the penis"; and I will now speak of these things more fully with a clear and short exposition.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say, that stone generated in the urethra often happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And of the signs of it is that the urine issues from the urethra like water in its subtility; and there appears in it white sand, and it irritates the penis of the sick person, and causes him to ache, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then he erects it and turns it with him; the anus is moved in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And it is easy to cure boys until they are fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in young people it is medium, because it lies between the two; and the cure is easier when the stone is small, but if it is large, it is difficult to cure it; and if it is small, it is cured easily from within.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the cure, at first we should change the sick man's faeces with a laxative, so that he may eliminate all the dung that is in his intestines; for sometimes it prevents the examination of the stone.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then we should take the sick man by the feet and shake him, and move him downward; so that the stone may fall into the deep part of the bladder or sometimes jump out from its high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then we should make him sit between your hands with his knees pulled up, so that the bladder is completely emptied downward towards the bottom.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine it and feel it from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel the stone in a space, then move immediately with your knife on top of it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your hand at all, then you should wipe your index finger with oil from the left hand, if the sick person is a boy; or with the middle finger if he is fully grown: and push him into some part of his anus, and feel for the stone until it lies under your finger: and slowly turn him towards his bladder neck.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on top of it with your finger and push him towards the outside against the place where you want to make the section; and order one minister to press the bladder with his hand, and another minister to stretch the testicles with his right hand upward; and with his left hand, to move the skin that is under the testicles in the part where the section is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then introduce the spatulum incidentally, which has this form.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the testicles and the anus, and not in the middle, towards the left side of birth: and let the cut be made on top of the stone, and your finger be placed in the anus: and let the cut be made transversely, so that the outside cut is wide and the inside cut is tight, according to what is possible for the exit of the stone out of it not be larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps your finger that is in the anus, which holds the stone near the cut, and it comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that from the stone are its corners and edges, so it is difficult to come out for that reason.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is smooth, like a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	So then add to the fissure for those who have corners and edges.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out like this, then you should invent on top of it: or tighten it with a twitch on the sides, whose end is as the moon, which tightens over the stone and does not break away from it: or put under it a thin instrument, with curved ends.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot do it above, then increase the hole slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something wins your blood, cut off the stone with a knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if the stone is more than one, then push it into the first large opening of the urethra.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut on top of the stone.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push a little behind it, and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is very large, then ignorance is how to cut off the stone with a large cut.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it has happened to an ill person of the two things, or that he dies, or because his urine has become frequent: soon, because the place is not consolidated at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But give him the means to expel it, until he comes out: or use a hook on its break, until you take it out quickly.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the ulnar cavity with thure, aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it tightly, and place a wet cloth over it with oil and wine, or rose water, and cold water: that an apostema may be sedated by the heat.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then let the patient lie down on his back with his neck supported, and do not loosen the ligatures until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosed him, embalm the place with much oil and water.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the patient with the dyafinicon ointment and the basilicon ointment until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if an apostema of the warm sort has been added, and it has corroded and is similar to that which congels in a vein; let there be no urine passed from it, and let it be recognized by the exit of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Then insert your finger into the ulnar cavity and extract the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if any remains, it incites to the corruption of a vein and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the ulnar cavity with vinegar, water, and salt; and oppose to it whatever is suitable from the healing process until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And in the hours of the cure throughout, bind two knees, and gather together herbs which are laid on the place, with medicines that are placed over it.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	But if the stone is small and sits in the meatus of the urethra and has become fixed there and prevents urine from passing: then care for the patient with this stone before you cut it open.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For this cure will often delay the section; for I have already tested it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is as follows: take a perforator from iron, of this form, with a triangular end, acute and fixed on a wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and bind it to the penis under the stone so that it does not recede into the urethra.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into his penis with ease, until it reaches its stone: and remove the piercing iron from your hand on that stone bit by bit: and feel his piercing, until you make him pierce from the other part.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Urine then is immediately cleaned out.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on that which remained of the stone from the outside part of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it itself is broken, and comes out with urine, and the sick one is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this cure has not been prepared for you because of something that keeps him back: then tie a cord under the stone, and a different cord above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry up on the stone in the penis between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then take out him.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then remove the ligature, and clean up the frozen blood which formed in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the cord under the stone unless it recedes towards the skin: and a different cord from above, unless when the cord is released after the stone has come out, the skin turns back to its place, and closes the wound as before your other ligature, and because of that necessity you must tie the upper cord so that it turns the skin upward, so that it returns with your other ligature, and closes the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	The extraction of the Stone in Women.
Caput LXI.	CHAPTER LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stone is generated little in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if any one of them has the stone: then the cure is difficult, and it is prevented because of many ways.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is this: that perhaps she is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not visit a woman who takes care of herself by a physician when she is chaste, or among those who have husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	And the third is, because you do not visit a woman who knows this art well, especially the work with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	The fourth is distance from the stone: why does it need deep incision, and there is danger in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	That if necessity compels to that, then you should take a woman physician who is well-versed in it: and little is found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you really want to do that, then ask a competent, subtle doctor; and present a woman obstetrician who is well-versed in the matter of women, or a woman who has some skill in this art: so make her present, and above all things ask her to do whatever you command her to do in respect of the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, that is, so that she may see if the woman is a virgin: then it should be necessary for her to insert her finger into her and feel the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	But if she finds it, she should cut it with her finger, and then command the obstetrician to insert his finger into the weak place, and feel for the stone, after he has put his left hand on the hip and pressed it with a good grip.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	But if she finds the stone, then it should be necessary for her to move it gradually from the opening of the hip to the lower part with all her strength, until she has brought it to the root of the pelvis.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should cut it on the opposite side of the hip at the root, from whichever side it is ready for her, and feel the stone in that part: and her finger should not move away from the stone, holding it down: and a small incision should be made first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she should insert the tip of the blade on top of that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	But if she feels the stone, then she should add to the second cut an amount proportional to how much the stone moves away from her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you shall know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For from these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and an asper one, a long one, and one that is round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Understand his nature, so that it may be explained to you through this regarding what you wish to know.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If then blood makes you win, then add in the place of the wound three things and hold it for an hour, until the blood is dried up.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then go back to your work, until the stone comes out: and make, so that you prepare with you from instruments, which I said in extracting the stone in the urinary tract, so as to help with them in your work.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	That if you win over you the flow of blood, and know that the expulsio of blood is from the artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with a powder stricture going down: and do not change that: and let go of the stone, and do not remove it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the woman will die if she becomes weak.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When then sharpness of blood sits after days, and the place is putrefied, then go back to your work, until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	§ About the section over Hernias with water.
Caput LXII.	Head LII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The aqueous Ramet is not, unless an aggregation of moisture in the skin of the penis, which is a one-inch square that lies under the skin of the scrotum: and is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in its own pannus itself, which nature has prepared for it in part unless it becomes purulent: that is another one, and it is the skin of the testicles between the sifac white, which I have said: and it does not do this except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And generation of this ramification, is from the weakness that happens to the testicles: so that it is spilled on them this substance.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when there comes from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or indeed the color of it declines into citroniness, or is bloody rubies, or feculentous, black, or is aqueous white, and that which is more: and this is what is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the aggregation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the scrotum or that which we have said, then the swelling is round to the length roughly like the figure of a circle: and the testicle does not appear, because moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in the fold itself for itself, then the swelling is round with part of it, and for this reason a man estimates that another is, because it is one other.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it falls down.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish to know the color of moisture, then experience the color of moisture in the swelling with the square insertion, whose shape preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, because it is removed from the entrance into the insertion, judge of it that which is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we have come to the cure with the iron, then it is necessary that you order the sick person, if it can be done, to let blood for him, and you will see the body of him full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he shall lie down on his back upon a raised thing slightly, and put many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then you shall sit on his left side, and order the minister to sit on his right side, who shall stretch out his penis between the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the scrotum.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a flat and broad blade of grass, and dry up the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, up to the chest: and let the section be according to a straight line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it comes to the white scrotum encompassing it: and examine the flesh itself, or rather hide it out of it, as much as you can: and carefully look at it with the scarification according to the amount that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the white scrotum full of water with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with a hook, and spread the skin upward, and do not touch the skin that encompasses the testicles: and cut the skin in any way you can cut it yourself, or completely, or partially, especially its side is thin.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not examine it carefully, there will be no security in the incision, except that the water should be washed away.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if it proceeds outward from your skin at the time of your operation: then, when you have finished the incision, reduce the skin.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for the skin as you do for other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	That if any of the skin becomes corrupted from another color, then you must use the ties of the suspenders, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspender, and take out the sperm: then care for it with what I have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if water is gathered on both sides, then you should know that there are two branches: so dry one side equally according to what you have done to the other branch.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is even for you, so that there is a single operation: then do it; then wash away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce the wool that is dipped in oil, or in oil rosin: and put a second wool that you have dipped in wine and oil on top of the two testicles, and press the eyes of the testicles: and put two pieces of cloth on top of them, and make them flat: and tie them together with a thread that has six turns according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, and tie them up, and fill them with carmine, according to this similarity: and let the ends that are pressed by thorns, or by wet wool: and join them together with a knot at the back of the arms: and one end should take hold of something on top until it reaches the back, and the other end should take hold of the side of the pelvis: and let the two ends come together at the bottom of the sides, and let the other end come together at the two hips, and let the whole knot be joined together at the back of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And, when this wire is surgically treated with a cautery at the site of the cut with an iron: and it is, so that you accept the kultellare cautery subtilely, and separate with it the skin of the testicles: and it is lit up, according to what we have said: until it is detected when the सफک album containing water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It assimilates Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that sifac, and it is lit up, until all the moisture exits.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend that sifac with a hook, and scrape with the subtle lit cautery, and cut himself as much as is possible for you, until you completely remove it all.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And let the egg not touch his own flesh.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you should know that this operation is healthier, and further away from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with a cut.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if the contradiction that you cause in the hour of the cut, or in the hour of the cautery, hot swelling, or blood flow, or something else: then it should be that you cure what the contradiction that you cause ex illo with the cure that suits him, according to what we have said above.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if he is shy and does not expect this operation on his own, due to its horrible nature: then administer the cut according to what I narrate above: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certain to yourself with regard to what we have said about the meanings of the wire, that it is water: then it should be that you make the sick sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the swelling at its lower part with a sharp blade: and place the cut according to the length of his body, and leave the opening wide, until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put a cloth over the site of the cut, and tie him up, and let him run to drain off the remaining water: then care for him, until he heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is a resistance to the exit of water at the time when you pierce it: and this should not be done except for that reason, because the white pannus makes a resistance in the opening of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then you should put your finger into the wound, or the instrument from which the water of hydrops is extracted, whose form has preceded: or add a little to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns, and is added after six months, or around them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	So when it is added, then it returns in the same way, and the sick person will spend his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the care of the ram's horn.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should know that in this section on the ram, there is a fear that leads to harm in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore I return to you from it, so that you may be healed from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am reminded of the operation in it, and the appearance of blisters.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I therefore say that many blisters occur in the bodies, from which the testicles are composed: and it is due to many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute surplush, or from acrimony, which is discharged onto the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the blister corresponds to the color of the body, and it does not hurt: and the blisters are gray.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a blister of stone, the color of which is dark, and there is no sensation.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it is due to the knotting of arteries, and their swelling: as I have already reminded you: or from swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	So what is due to swelling of the arteries, it is recognized by the appearance of a blister when you squeeze it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch it at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That is true that what is due to swelling of the veins does not disperse anything when you squeeze it with your fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	It is also possible that a section be made on this form and on the remaining flesh; it is, in order to cut off the skin of the testes.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend your hand to the top and take it out with the scrotum or; free the suspenders from the stream, and tie the stream: and cut the suspenders after you have freed it from all parts of the parts that you.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	So if your consolidated hand is with those flesh-born flesh, then it must be that you attract your hand and cut it off.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if the adhesion is between any of the scrotum, or in it that is between the stream: then you must free all this adhesion and cut it off with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however the birth of flesh is at the place of adhesion that is behind: then it must be that you cut off all this one, and take out your hand, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When you have finished your operation, then fill the wound with wool infused with rose oil and wine: and then take care of the wound with the remaining cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Of the cure of the vine, which is with the grapevine.
Caput LXIIII.	Head LXIIII.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It is useful an embolism in a certain way by embolization, similar to a boil, with the softening of the testes: and it becomes difficult on the movement of the sick and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure of this illness is from fear, because of the which was the recollection of that which preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it should be said, let us say the operation in that according to what did the first.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, then, that you need to make the sick sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspenders of the testes towards the lower side.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testes with your fingers, where they are next to the vine: and keep them by another, and extend them with a strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a sharp chisel by cutting transversely through the direct vasorum, until the vas are recognized.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape away all parts, as we have told you when extracting the arteries which are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix in them the acumen where there is a double filament, and tie it in the first places where the vines occur: and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry them out in a straight medium section along the length of the body, and remove what is aggregated from the corrupt腐敗的湿潤物。
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then take care of the wound with the cure of the remaining wounds, in which the blood is generated, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For this is not a fault through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if all the vessels are cut off, then they should be removed from this testicle with the vessels because otherwise the blood will not be nourished by it, for the incision, and will dry up or become inflamed, and will not be a cure for it with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	The cure of the intestinal ramus:
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV:
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The head of this ramus is from a section which occurs in the side of the stomach in the part of the groin from the inner edge of the thigh.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the small intestine or from the extension of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds of causes occur for many reasons: either from a blow, or from a fall, or from a noise, or from lifting a heavy thing, and the like.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign, when it is from the extension of the small intestine.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which occurs gradually over a long time and not suddenly: and it is a swelling of the same size as the depth: because the small intestine is compressed by the hernia.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And a sign of it is when it occurs from the section of the hernia, because it causes sudden severe pain from its origin: and it is a swelling which appears under the skin nearby: and this is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of it to the external hernia.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes when he goes out with the small intestine: and this is called the intestinal ramex, and zirbia; and sometimes it is done with a windiness.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes when it runs into feces in the intestine and is held there: and there with him is a sore nurse; because it causes pain before, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of this kind of disease with iron there is a danger; for which reason one must be careful to avoid such a risk.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the mode of operation is this: you must teach the sick person to bring his intestine by hand into his hollow place, if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he shall lie on his back between your hands; and wipe his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin upward, and dry the skin of the testicles from top to bottom.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then put the nails in two lips of the incision, according to how you open the incision with them: and the section be as big as possible, that it may come out of it without any difficulty.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the skin of the testicles, and that which is under the skin, until when it is touched, white siphac comes out from all parts: then introduce your finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between white siphac, which is under the skin, and between the second siphac, and break the attachment which is in the back part of the scrotum.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand into the inside of the skin of the testicles: and while doing so, extend white siphac upward with your left hand: and wipe the oozing with siphac to the section: and order the minister to extend the oozing upward: and you shall break the attachment, which is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	Then seek with your fingers that there is nothing there of the intestines that have been torn in siphac or hard.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If, however, something has come out from it: then push him toward the lower wind.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take hold of the sack, in which there is a thick thread, made from ten threads: and insert it between the last sifach, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles, following the section: then cut off the extremities which protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then join some of them together with a shape that is in the form of a cross: and bind them with an alsifach, of which we have spoken, because it is a binding under the skin of the testicles, so that there cannot be any sending out of the sweat which nourishes them to send to them anything, lest there be a fever.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And put again another ligature second, far from the first by two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures have been, leave out of the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity as big as a finger: and cut off the rest all around, and take out one.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which runs blood and pus: as we have told you before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer the wool that has been soaked in oil, and put it on a twig: and administer the ligature which we have told you.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the sifach of white wax, of which we have spoken, is cauterized after the incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	Then let go of the ligature, until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if the falling is delayed, then simmer it with hot water: and put on top of that which we have spoken, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the twig with the rest of the wound's treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	[The ramie plant.]
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this ramage there was no one who dared to cure it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said that it happened as we have told you in the ramage which is with the vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, so that the strings are used after the section on it with ease below: then dry in the middle, and care afterwards with what opens itself, until the strings fall: and cure of the knot, according to what we said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	On the dissection which takes place in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LVII. On the head.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture takes place in the groin, as we have said, and a space is revealed, and nothing of the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is little, and returns in all seasons: indeed, if it lingers with that time, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And what happens from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the sifach extends: then softens, and a space appears, and it is revealed.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its cure is with poultice, as precedes its narration.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when it is cured with iron, in this way: and it is so, that the sick person lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry up the space of the rupture which has been revealed and prominent, by a section across its width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the sifach with a string and, what is under the skin, until, when it is touched, the white part of the sifach which is under the skin is revealed, that is following itself.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a ray, and put the person on the prominent place from the sifach, and press the person towards the root of the penis.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then open two prominent places on the end of the ray from the sifach, and connect them with a stitch one to another: then remove the end of the ray.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not drop the sifach at all, nor stretch one, nor any other, as I have told you to know in the cure of the intestinal branch.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then care for that care of the wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	So when you strike the line, clean that up, and restore the splinter, until it hardens.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	Because the blade is struck, and no excellence is added to the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place; because it is closer to salvation.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	About softening the skin of the testes.
Caput LXVIII.	Head LVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testes is often softened in certain men, because the flesh that is between them becomes soft and sallow.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to cure him, that he lay down the sick man on his back, and strike all of the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he will aggregate two lips with a stitch; and if there is an excess of the softened skin, in the first place three stitches, or four, and a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then he will cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the cure of the other wounds, until they are healed, and the splinters fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	About Castration:
Caput LXIX.	Head LIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that castration is excommunicated in our law; and because of it I should remind you in this book not to remember it, unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	The first is that it may be in the knowledge of a physician when he is questioned about it; and so that he knows how to treat it for him who has suffered from it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is that we often lack the use of castration in certain animals, for our own purposes through them, such as rams, horses, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say, then, that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by abrasion.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by a slit and a cut.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by abrasion the method of operation is: that we may make the animal sit in hot water until his testes become softened and lax, and hang down; then we will dry them with our hand, until they resolve and do not appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	But in the castration by incision and section, you must hold the animal, and with your left hand press the skin of his testicles. Then tie the suspensorium, and dry all the section in one place until the two testicles come out: then cut them after you have cleaned them both, and do not leave anything on them from the sutures except for a thin thread that is above the urethra.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by friction: for by friction there may be left some of the testicles, so that the animal desires to have coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	There are two methods for treating hermaphroditism:
Caput LXX.	Head
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodite is from the testicles, according to two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	The vagus is from them, because it appears to be a hair growing between the two testes or on the skin of the testes, and sometimes urine flows out of it which appears on the skin of the testes.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	But in women there is one form, and it is a vaginous form like the testicles of a male, protruding towards the outside: of which one is like the penis of a male, and the two are like the two testes.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three species, the two testicles from a male and one testicle from a female, is this: for you should cut off the flesh that has been added until the impression disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then take care of them in their cure until all wounds are healed.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	But in the second species of men, from which urine flows from the skin of the testes, there is no operation, nor is there any cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the incision of the hymen and the protrusion of flesh in a woman's vagina.
Caput LXXI.	Head
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The hymen may be added with care to its natural position until it is nourished and its appearance is improved: and sometimes it becomes so enlarged in some women that it reaches up to intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore you should hold the tentigo with your hand, or with a hook, and fall upon it: and do not make the incision late, especially in a deep root: so that blood does not flow.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the cure of the wound, until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	Now the middle part is precious, that which comes forth out of the womb, until it fills itself up: and perhaps it goes out to the outside according to the similarity of a tail: and because of this they call some sort of sickness having a tail.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore you should make the incision on it as we made it on the tentigo, and take care of it, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Regarding the treatment of the hymen, which is a wound in a woman that has not been penetrated.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The Alratica is, so that it may be a wound in a woman that has not been penetrated, or that there may be a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	The accidental one is from a previous sickness, and that itself is either born of flesh that has been added, or a splinter, or filth: and it is in the depth of the womb, or on its sides, or on top of it, or at its bottom; and prevents coitus and impregnation, and birth, and perhaps also menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of this is obtained by the appearance of the midwife, if the swelling is close at hand.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then ask her with your fingers, or with a ray.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If the swelling is from a small splinter, and it is close to two lips: then lean near, and clean it out.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, so that you put on two lips some dust.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands at the same time, and the woman should lie on her back with her legs spread wide.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch the two lips with force, until the small splinter is dislodged, and the swelling opens.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a piece of cloth, dip it in oil, and place it over the wound; and let a woman touch it every day so that the wound does not heal with other fluid.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the wound is large or dense: then it is necessary that the wound be separated by a thin leaf of Myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the wound is caused by putrid flesh: then suspend it with a hook and cut it: and have ready the medicines that stop the flow of blood without causing itching, such as acacia and dragon's blood, and the white of an egg with alum.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a large silver tube so that the wound does not heal quickly, keep it for several days: and administer wolf-flea oil made from dry linen, then cure the rest with the usual cure, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when the animals are born from their mother's womb, it is necessary that they be born according to this method: while there is no apoplexy of cancerous flesh, since cancerous flesh comes from the womb, there should be no contrast with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	For the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athelil and Bothor of red rubers in the wound of a woman.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are an opening of the anal orifice, until it runs with a lot of blood regularly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When, however, hemorrhoids increase, they become Athelil; and I have already spoken in the division of their kinds and signs, and I will tell here those that receive the cure from them, and those who do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say, then, that the hemorrhoids which are in the womb' opening, and do not appear to have any sensation: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those which are in the womb' opening above what drops down, are the ones that are healed.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore it is necessary that you put the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Athelil with forceps or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over the wound of flowing blood from one powder-cut without mortification: like acacia, and dragon's blood, and thistle, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then he pressed his feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then he put it into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	That if the flow of blood persisted: then let her sit in a decoction of sumac, and of gum mastic, and of gall-nut, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it for his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If then blood is shed with it, it is good: and if not, make it adhere to the back of hair-picks, and of milk-teets, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and dip it in tar-weed juice, or in lamb's tongue juice, or in willow-branch juice, that is, without taste, in Pontic wine, and make it adhere to his loin.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When then the poultice has dried up, then take care of the place with ointment, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth is really like a red cap and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then it is necessary that you should cut off what appears from it, according to what I said in the book about wounds being equal: and take care of itself, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	De Perforatione In Matre
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXII on the Perforation which takes place in the Womb:
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Take place in the womb species of poultices, such as cancer, and hard poultice, and ulcers, and blisters, and scabs, and sores, and the lilies, and hot poultice.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already said all about these ailments and their species, and the signs of them, and their cures, in a division: it is necessary that I should say in this book of hot poultice which takes place in the womb, when it is from poultices which gather the sap, and how to know its opening with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	You should therefore consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the wound is sharp in its beginning and with his percussion, and there is a flame and fever: and you see it red: if he falls on him, then do not suit with his perforation: and take care of him with that which he can bear over maturation, until when it stops, then its sharpness of accidents.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make a woman sit on a chair that will support two seats, and recline, or lean down, and bring her feet to the lower side of her leg: and let her hips be spread out, and put her arms under her knees, and tie each with a ligament fitting her.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which she opens the opening of the womb.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary that when you administer this instrument, you should make it come out of the womb of the woman as if it were a string: so that it does not enter into the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and does not hurt the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you put a little hole over the depth of the womb: so as to prevent the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb: and it is necessary that you put a little roll, which runs in the instrument from the upper side, and holds the instrument, and makes it turn, until the opening of the depth.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	Then when it appears to come out, and is touched by hand, and is soft and smooth: then it is necessary that you separate it from the head with a wide spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	Then when the liquid comes out, then it is necessary that you put a little iron rod immersed in olive oil: or olive oil, in which there is some stiffness: and put the iron, and draw out a segment in the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put outside on the womb, and on the wool, which is clean, immersed in water, in which there are boiled eggs.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let it be bandaged for two days with the ointment which suits that, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix and the knot have been washed away so that they are covered with a scab, so that it clatters with water and honey: then let it be returned to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the knot is hidden within the matrix, then it is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, but rather to take care of itself with it as we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrines on Obstetrics, how embryos are treated by the womb, according to a not natural figure of exit.
Caput Lxxu.	70th Head.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to recognize in the first place the natural figure of childbirth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From these signs then, when you see the woman compressing herself towards the lower parts, and longs for air, and eases herself upon her who is about to give birth, and hurries out the child's exit; then know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and its exit is over its head, and second with it: or hanging, or swinging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When then you see these signs, then let the woman compress her abdomen, that the embryo may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it has descended over its head, the second has descended with it, and is washed out from them by good purification of effluents.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But if this birth is not such, let it be known as an unnatural, unacceptable one.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus has exited his feet and the body of him has gone out before its head, and its feet and hands one, or its foot and hand the other way: or if its head and hands have gone out; or if it has gone out by the navel, and perhaps has turned over its neck, and similar figures which are unacceptable.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent and cautious in all these matters, and to guard himself against error and deception: and I am showing you every figure from them, and what ability there is in it, and making known by it, and shouting over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the child has come out of its mother's womb by a natural delivery, and has become heavy upon her, and labor has become difficult for her, and her strength has begun to fail: then let them make her sit on a chair, or let women support her; and let them pour upon her the water of foenugraeco with a decoction, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife shall insert her fingers between her thighs and find the second child, and dry it with her nail, until she has taken what is there out of her moisture; and she shall press the woman's belly, until the child falls.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not fall down, then let the woman be made to sit on a cloth of foenugraeco with sisamus oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command her to compress herself; and let her sneeze while she is holding her nose, at one time.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the child will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the child come out first, then you shall reduce them with ease little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey in the entry, then let the woman sit on a chair, and raise her feet up; then let her turn the chair over onto the ground; and let women support her so that she does not fall with the vibration.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	But if the hands do not come out, and the child dies: then let them make an incision, and take out the remaining child; and bind her hand with a cloth, and take him out with equality: for he will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the child is on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the child comes out of its feet, then you shall push them up; and gradually turn the child around; and then make it even.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then let her take one foot of the child, and stretch it out little by little.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	But when they come out as far as the thighs, then command her to compress herself, and make her sneeze while she is holding her nose: for it shall come out if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if he does not come out with it as we have said, then bring the fetus back slowly until you put him in the natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he himself will come out then if we make an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	That if it is forbidden with him all that we have said: then take out of a bag of nettle, and oil of sesame, and of dissolved gum: and strike everything in the mortar with good beating: then line with him the woman's uterus, and lower his feet.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she gets a hiccup.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	But when you see that his lower parts are now warmed, then give him a drink of myrrh: and support himself.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When he has held the drink for an hour, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and tighten his mouth and nose: and press the lower part of his uterus with gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For fire will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	Exit of the fetus on to his knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it has come out according to this form, then support by introducing your hands slowly.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie on her back and hang her feet down to the ground: and she herself lying on a bed, and make her hands tight.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press on her belly slowly.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under his feet from the genitals, until she is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	That if the fetus does not come out, then take his feet, and move them with a sudden motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hip bone slowly, until the fetus goes up to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then introduce your hands, and make the fetus go slowly: and order the woman, that she tightens, until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	Exit of the fetus hanging from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Is supported by introducing his hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If he cannot reduce it, then he should send for a woman, and make her walk about.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she is unable to walk, then let her lie on a bed; and by a vigorous shaking of her legs, let him try to bring about a reduction.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then, administer the ointment that you have prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she accepts it [the treatment], then let her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then, study the reduction of the hand, and make it as equal as possible to its natural shape: and make the woman sneeze, and tell her to squeeze herself until she has gone out [i.e., recovered full use].
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus over the collarbone, with expanded hands, and it is the face towards the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It should be that the midwife holds the fetus by the hand, then gently turns it, and makes it easy to bring about its Gleichung [i.e., full development].
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is thus made equal, then place it on the cushion that we have prepared with oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then tell her to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done this, then let her sit on a chair, and tell her to lean on the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then tell her to squeeze herself: and make her sneeze with pepper.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The prepared exit of the fetus is on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descended into the mother' second opening in this way  [with the second finger], then cut the second finger with your nail, until it is discharged from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is suspended over the face of the fetus and its collar, then cut it from the navel   [incision]: so that it does not remain, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus into the inside  [uterus], until you have placed it in the right place]: and tell the woman to squeeze herself now and then: for he will come out by itself, being light.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of the twins, or the fetus of many.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is strange, and seldom happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five, however, is a thing against nature, and they do not live in peace: and although they multiply, the second one remains united to them: and separates them, distinguishing between them by a knot in the navel of each.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they go out like a single fetus going out by a natural exit, easily: and they go out by an admirable exit, as we have related.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If any of them have difficulty at birth, and go towards that which we have said from an unnatural exit, then take care of them as we have related: and let it lie on a soft bed, and make what it makes with ease and slowness, and contrive according to all the shape with him that it is prepared by nature leading him to salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remember that it is formed in the womb from embryos, and aborts.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and it has already been proved with me that a woman has abortion to seven, and another thirteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which has been proved by the measurement of a glorious sage.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	This is what needs to be in the knowledge of obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will come to that same one: then oppose it with that which is necessary:
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you have trouble with the dead fetus because I said in the division of medication, and does not come out, and forces you to use surgery by hand, then you should reflect.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If then the woman is of sound virtue, and is not with any of the accidents from which she fears destruction: then it should be so that the woman lies on a bed, on her back, and has her head inclined downward, and her legs raised: and the assistant should hold her from both sides, or bind her to the bed, so that her body is not taken out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the bone with oil of olive, with mucus of the sea-oak, and with fenugreek seed and linseed oil.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the obstetrician moisten her hands with these oils and mucus; then let her enter the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then let him seek out a suitable place to insert the hook from the fetus, and suitable places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then, if the fetus is ready to come down on top of its head: then insert the hooks into its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its beard, or under its chin, or in its sides, and in the nearby places, and under its collarbone.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if descent is on its feet: then in the spine, and in its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it should hold the hook with its right hand; and place a loop on that which is between the fingers of its left hand; and let her insert with ease, and fasten the hook in one of those places which we have said, until she has reached the free part.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then let her fasten another hook in opposition to that one, or a third one, if it is not uncomfortable: so that there be an equal contraction, and it does not decline on one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with an equal extension, and not only be extended according to the straightness only, but also move in all directions, so that its passage is eased: as happens with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it should be in that which is between that one, so that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if a part of it is retained: then let the obstetrician moisten some fingers with oil, and insert them from the part which is retained, so that they rotate with them, which retains what is being held.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	But if a part of the fetus comes out: then shift the hooks to another place which is higher: do this until the entire fetus has come out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand has gone out before another, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its constriction: then it should be that a cloth is wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then remove it completely, when it has gone out, cut it or in the joint of the plant, or on the thigh: and so you should do to make the same on the other hand, and in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the head of the fetus is large, or has happened to it constriction in exit, or there is water gathered on its head: then it should be that he sticks between the fingers the Spatumile spinosum, and finds with him the head, and removes the water: or tears it out with an instrument which is called Almisdac: of whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly do if the nature of the fetus is large head, then it should be that he separates the algengemato: or remove it out with Misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then attract bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If however the head has gone out, and is constricted near the fork: then find it, until the moisture which is in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it is not complicated, and does not submit to the exit: then cut the head quickly, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If however the lower leg is inflamed, or there is water in it: then it should be that you pierce it, until the moisture flows out.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If however the fetus is on its own feet, then attracting it is easy, and its direction towards the mouth of the mother is slight.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is constricted near the belly, or the chest: then you should remove it with the cloth that you wrapped on your hand: and find the belly, or the chest, until what is in them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If however are removed other limbs, and returns the head: then the Midwife should put her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If the mouth of the mother is open, then insert your hand into the depth of the mother's mouth, and feel with your fingers her head, and draw it toward you by the teeth: then insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it toward you by them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mouth of the mother is clenched, because of the heat that occurs to her: then it is not necessary for him to work on top of it, but rather at that time it is necessary to administer the flow of wet substances, thick: and to administer plaster: and to sit in water that softens and moistens.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to make it even: then administer what we have said about the single fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then cut short, and remove it out.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary so that you do not leave anything inside at all from the second one.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about the hot apostemes that happen in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If blood flows, then go down into the water of strictness, and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have already seen a woman, in whose womb the fetus was dead: then she became pregnant on top of it with another force, and after that the fetus died again, and another also.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Then happened to her after a long time an aposteme in her navel, and it swelled up, until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was called to her cure, and I treated her at a long time: and the wound was not consolidated.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I placed on top of it from some strong plasters of attraction: and she came out from the place of the mouth.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then passed a few days for her, and she came out with another mouth.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was amazed from there, when there is no mouth in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought, because there were bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore inquired into the matter and drew out many bones, seeing that she was of better disposition than her husband; and now she had stayed such a long time and sent word from her place with a little delay.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not find this strange here, unless that there is knowledge and aid to it, which the doctor-artisan administers with his own hands from healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of instruments necessary for extracting the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the lower form of the strigil, which are equidistant from the ends of two pins fixed on two boards.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this form of the strigil should be made slightly finer than the strigil; and to make it so, either let it be of ebony or of hickory wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each piece of wood should be about two fingers wide; and the edge of either of them should be about a finger wide, and their length should be a palm and half as long as that; and there should be two additions of the same kind of wood in the middle of both, which have already been fixed on both sides, whose length is half a palm and a little less than that; and the width of each is about two fingers or a little less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that it opens with them as you rotate the two Strigiles.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Form of the strigil which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form, similar to it, but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood or hickory, according to the similarity of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its end there are two additions as you see here above: and the length of each addition is about a palm; and the width of either is about two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	So when you open the womb with it, then cause the woman to sit on a bed with her feet hanging down, and open what is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce the two additions joined together into the womb; and you are to hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you would with pincers, equally according to the quantity that you wish from the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of the other vertigo than the ancients said Form of Driven where driven fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	Form of Almizdak, by which is contorted the great head: and it is assimilated to the forceps, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is made round, like the forceps in this form, as you see, which have teeth like saw-teeth, so that it incises and contorts.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	Form of Almizdak where is contorted the small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form of the pin having one spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form of the pin having two spikes.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	Form of forceps which have saw-teeth, with which the head of the fetus is contorted.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	Form of scissor having two ends for cutting the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Form of the two scissors also carrying away.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used, and the more their kinds multiply, and are prepared by the artisan, the faster they are in their work, and the higher among men because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	So do not despise these instruments, since it is with you that they are prepared.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For necessity of them is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the extraction of the second.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second holds back at childbirth, then you should take the weak one, so that it retain its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with a condiscension: and tighten your hand upon her nose, and the nostrils of her.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If then she goes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a hammer, and pierce in the coopertorium hole: and put in it herbs opening the mouth of the matrix, like calamentum, ruta, and anethum, and camomile, and chamomile, and cassia lineous, and centaurea: take all the herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them on the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put on a bandage around the foramen of the cooperatorium of the foot, and another at the end of the molar: and hold it until the vapor has reached the concavity of the tooth.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then let her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the second time she will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	But if after this cure she remains stuck and does not come out: then order the Midwife, that she may dip her hand in olive oil or mucilage of aloes.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert it into the vulva and ask her if she is in second labor.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	But when she has found her, then take her, and slowly stretch her.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if she is stuck deep in the womb, then insert your hand, as we have described, until she finds the second stage, and slowly pulls her out according to the direction, so that the womb does not fall because of a sudden tug: it should be turned over with ease to the right and left: then add the amount of traction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For she will submit then, and cry out, and release herself from the attachments.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: take care of her with sneezing, and after the application of the ointment with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if she does not come out with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself out trying to extract her.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that, when she comes out from the womb at the mouth, some ties are tied to the woman's hips.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then clean her with the four-part ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will decay her after a few days, and dissolve her, and she will come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when she is decaying, there will come out from her a bad smell toward the stomach and head, and it will afflict it with sickness.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore it should be that appropriate vaporizations are administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some people have already been experienced in using nasturtium smoke and dried fig leaves.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument with which a woman is suffumed during her second and menstrual period.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let a cloth similar to hemp or linen be made, and let the wide end be placed on fire; and the smoke should be placed on plums; hold it until that smoke is consumed; and then take another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Regarding the treatment of an unborn child not pierced.
Caput LXXIX.	Head LVII.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and the womb of their mothers is not pierced by the needle of Syphus; they are now affected by a subtle heat of SiPhac.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is necessary that the midwife pierce the SiPhac with her finger; and if she does not do so, let her pierce it herself with a sharp awl: and let her be careful not to touch the snake, lest she be bitten by it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it the wool dipped in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you suspect that it is affected by heat, then place a lead pipe in the wound for several days, and remove it when the boy begins to urinate again.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And it also happens that the womb is affected by heat from the cooling of a wound or pus.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary that this consolidation be removed; and then care for it with what we have said regarding the treatment of a wound and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Regarding the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Head LIII.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are a kind of swelling and thicker substance near the anus of the buttocks: or in a single space of one part; and there is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	But when this swelling is dried up, it opens, and from it a liquid moisture, white and thin, flows out, or a subtle pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And when these fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Thus the penetrating ones are known by that which issues from the effluentation and the moisture, when a sick person uses it; and perhaps they issue from them dry.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And they are from them Fistulae when they are in the space penetrating up to the uesicam, and up to the meatum virgea.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are from them Penetrating up to the joint of the hip, and up to the knot of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this therefore is recognized Fistula Penetrating up to a joint, also from the non-penetrating, that is, you put your finger of the index in a joint: and you introduce a tenuous attempt in the Fistula made of bronze or iron: when there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	What if in it there is a tortuosity, then put in it a attempt made of a tenuous lead, or a bolt from the bolts of the horses, until you feel the attempt, or a bolt in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	What if you don't feel it the same way, and does not go out from a pore any excretion, and no verve, and no skin as I said: then you know that it is not penetrating: so then turn to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the Fistula is penetrating up to the uesicam, or up to the meatum of the urine: then the meaning of it is the exit of the urine from it, and the prevention of it from this in order that the place consolidate with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it is penetrating up to the joint of the hip, or up to the jaw of the hip: then the sign of it is that it reaches the attempt so far, if there is no tortuosity so far to the jaw: and the finding of pain in the circumference of the part, and that it is discharged pus from it always: and that it doesn't ooze in it the medication, and doesn't consolidate with an unguent.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these Penetrating Fistulae there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is a work and a waste to it, from stupid doctors, who form one.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not penetrating, and not old, there is hope of cure with a serrou: second, for I tell you, and I have already proved it: and it is, so that the sick man lies between your hands on his back: and you wash his legs up to above his knees, and his knees are bent towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce lead or air, if it is in a winding fistula, until you know where the opening lies.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, he feels it to be weak at a certain point, then you should introduce your finger with the index at that point.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If, then, you feel that the tenting has already penetrated into yourself through your finger and between your finger and the sifac, or meat: so you will certainly know that it has penetrated; do not therefore work on it, because it is not its cure, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said, However, that it heals in some people by meat, and from the treatment which they hope will help, that is, to introduce a small torch of fire along the length of the fistula, as mentioned above, and to introduce the torch into the fistula until it reaches a certain point.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that several times, twice or three times, until you know that all the added filtered meat, which is similar to a feather-like tube, has dried up.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then the cure with liniments of oil, until the meat which has dried up comes out: then the cure with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If he is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then he is not healed with any other cure.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the fistula comes out, and does not reach as far as your finger which is in the anus, and is between the fistula and a thick piece of meat, or sifac: and you see that the fistula follows the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will find that the dried-up part has come out with the fistula, until it reaches the point where the end of the tenting comes out, and the tenting is released and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered meats which are similar to feather-like tubes so that nothing of them remains.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If, however, the blood makes you win and it separates from you and your operation in such a way as to separate those meats: then it is better that it should be done and with greater speed of aid, cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Since the cauterization with fire brings good habits, to the burning of those tissues, and to the separation of blood, and to the drying up of humors.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then that care with smooth liniments in butter, or with ground rags, until the place lets out pus, and those dried-up meats come out.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care then with consolidating ointments, which generate hard meat: and there are medicines in which are sterility and drying up.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they have healed, then you have cured: and do not put off the application.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If, however, the fistula has reached down to the depth of the hip, and it is elongated from the excess of the body's fluid: then introduce your hand into that place, and ask it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If, therefore, you feel an attempt at it, and there is a weapon between you and it, whether of stone or of meat, and it is near to the penetration: then that operation in that place should not be done, except by way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, for there are two ways of dealing with it: or, as we have said, to cauterize it, or to separate it, until you get a complete concavity of it, so that you can introduce a liniment, and healing from near.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the section, so that you do not fall upon a constrictor which is in some part of the body, and happens to an unwanted exit of the expiration without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for that with it, as we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps then it will be cured: or, if you prolong that weapon, and dry it up a little after the other part, as we have said, or with an attempt, or with another acute instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then clean those filthy meats which are in the incision, as far as you can see with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then consider the restoration of the whole wound with the incision, and the hole above where it is healed: and there remains a fistula open in the interior part of the anus, and it will be looser over the weak one.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when this kind of fistula follows: and it is when you introduce a stick into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus: then take the end of the stick which is like a needle, that is, the prepucial skin, according to this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it the string wound up in five threads, and around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then introduce a stick with a thread into the fistula, until you get a knot.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it therefore penetrates into the inner margin of the anus near, then remove the string from that hole: so that you can introduce your finger into the anus, and remove the end of the thread, and gather the two ends together at the same time: and tighten each one, and leave it for a day or two days: and as much as the thread pierces the flesh, tighten it well, until those meats which are between the two ends of the string fall off: then take care of the wound, until it is healed and cured.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the hole of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate wherever you prepare it for yourself, unless it is in a deep place.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not good for you, that you should make it like a snake, lest you hit yourself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the hook which is found in the fistula, whose curve is sharp very much, and the other part is not curved, so that it does not hit what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	From the suture of hemorrhoids, from which runs blood from the incision of them: and take care of the fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LIII.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are inside the anus, like charcoal, or prunes; or almost like grains of sand.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them there are small ones and large ones; and the blood always flows from them, and one is not enough, and many are needed.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremes.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those outside the anus are mostly a little wetness from which yellow water flows, or a little blood flows regularly: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment that is inside the anus is, as you instruct the sick to sit on it: and it is squeezed out, until it comes out of the anus, and appears to you like a stone.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore also hang it with a hook: or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they do not retain hooks because of their moisture and softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a twine of loose wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them and sprinkle some hot powder on them after the cut so that they stand in place of a cauldron.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was said in the chapter of cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	That if the anus does not obey the exit, then enema the sick with an enema in which there is a small mordicatio, so that it flows with it what is in the ano, and obeys the exit quickly, when it is expressed, since the sick.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the stone is external to the ano, then the matter of them is light and easy: and it is like you take them with your nail, or take them with a hook, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with that which I have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever hates to cut with iron, then it is necessary that you administer the suture to them in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a thread that has been washed, and insert it into the wound.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then remove the thread to the top, and make it penetrate with the needle from one side: and bind the two ends of the thread together, below on the part of the needle: and make them lie parallelly: and tighten the knot strongly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie a knot in the thread, and remove the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Make that also with all of the threads, and let go of one of them: and do not tie your own, so that it may flow out of it any surplus blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place on a cloth soaked in rose-water or balm-water, and place it on: and order the sick person to lie down.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let go of him, until he falls down.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the threads have fallen off, take care of them with ointment, and with the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	§ On the Care of Sores.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Often do sore-heads come about from drying up with stool, and from nature's contraction.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they begin to get white and do not heal with medicine: then you should scrape them with the point of a scalpel or with your own nail, until they are moist, and remove from them the upper crust which prevents them from being consolidated.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them, until they are consolidated, according to what needs to be done.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not consolidate: then scrape them again with a sharper scalpel than before, until they bleed much and become sore again: and then take care of them, until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	§ On the Cure of Scurvy, which affects only the skin: and of dry wounds, and of bees.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that scurvy is a small round knot, similar to the head of an awl, which appears throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and it causes pain on walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is necessary that you should cut off what is in the situation of the claw, and be held with pliers, or with a hook, and be uprooted from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then take care of that: and if you want to cauterize it, follow what has preceded in his chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	But from the above mentioned there is a small eminence, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often happen to the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the cure of it is, that you should spread out the knuckle, and hit it: or string it with silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you want to cauterize the knuckle according to what has preceded, with fire or with sharp medicine; and already are rooted out the knuckles immersed, and not immersed with an instrument that I call it.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	But the ant is also a small eminence, filtered, thick, on the surface of the body, diving into the depths: and when it is found it feels like a tiny sting of an ant, and it becomes throughout the body: and much of it is formed in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And the cure of it is, that you should take a tube from a goose feather, or a strong turkey feather: and put this tube on the ant, until it holds a circle of the tube from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the tube, until you separate what is in the situation of the ant; and put it in the depth of the flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you want to, do it with an air tube, or a iron tube, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the tube be placed above the limit, dragging a dull furrow, so as to ease the pressure of its grip and its turn.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you want to cauterize the ant according to what has preceded in cauterizing Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	On the forms of instruments used for enemas to treat diseases of the rectum, and for irrigating the eyes and treating the colon.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter Liii. On the forms of instruments used for enemas to treat diseases
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When cl isteries are made of silver, or of gold-plated silver, or of brass, or of hammered bronze.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when they are made from these small or large instruments, depending on those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore that which is administered to the cure of young boys should be small; and if their anus are weak or painful, then also their enemas should be small.
Clistere magnum.	A large enema.
Cistere paruum.	A small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The cane of the instrument, that is to say, the upper part in which it is tied to the womb, should be wide according to this manner: and let there be a distinction so that it is tied as you see, and the lower extremity which enters into the anus, is flat, that is, not open, soft, greatly, drawing towards subtility: and on one side of its there are two holes, and on the other side a hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the holes be according to the thickness of the radii, and the thicker the better, and let the womb be in which the medicines are put from a liquid animal: or from paper which is according to the form of an atom small: whose root is a palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let there be many holes pierced as it was rolled up, and let there be space which is the width of a finger between each hole.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce into those holes a strong thread from raw flax, that it should be of ten strands, or about them, and bind with it so that it is like an atom.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When it is put into this womb, let it be drawn up in the head of the enema between two distinctions with a strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then wash out the enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of a circle as it is depicted here, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of washing out the enema with it is: to fill the womb, or the medicine which is warmed according to the tolerance of the nurse: and let not be hot greatly, or cold greatly.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then he should lie on his back and raise his legs up: and place under him a mattress or a blanket.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then he should dip the limb in oil, or in chalk, or in mucus of fenugreek, or something similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the body hole with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then he should take a servant and both of them should press it out with force, until all that is in the clister is drained into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the clister, and let the sick person raise his legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	That if the medicine makes him want to defecate, then he should hold back as much as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more effective in healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you use the clisterization in the solution of a long-standing disease, and the defecation is sudden: then repeat the clisterization until the person is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	That if there are hemorrhoids or itching in the anus, then use a very subtle clisterization with olive oil, wax, or mucus of fenugreek, or something similar.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a subtle clisterization on top of which there is a tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	For the treatment of wounds to the head without a fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIII.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds which suited the book, and I now say here the treatment of these with the hand, and with second aid.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say, therefore, that wounds differ according to the cause of the wound, and according to the place on which it falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore the wounds which are often caused are like the impact of stones: or a cut from a knife, or a blow from a lance, or a piece of wood, or an arrow: and similar things from many other causes.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	But wounds which are caused according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the members thereof.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling about some wounds, so that I may set forth a reason and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: since the memory of composers will come at the beginning of chapter three.
Dico ergo.	I say:
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When it has happened in the head, a simple wound, and there is no fracture of bone: consider then, if it is from a throw of a stone, or similar, and has already torn the skin only: and it is a great wound, and you fear about possible gangrene of the heat: then hasten, and immediately phlebotomy cephalic: and do not delay that: and draw out of it blood according to its quantity of strength: if it were not prohibiting anything from phlebotomy, especially if it were the blood which comes out from the wound little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let there be phlebotomy from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person refrain from drinking, and wine, and coarse food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If however a little restraint prohibits anything, then let him abstain from food, and do not come near to meat, or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put on the wound if it has happened to it a hot aphorism, or the infusum mixed with rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is stipticitis.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If however you are safe from a hot aphorism, then put on the wound if it is new with its own blood, and has not changed air, then I will tell about the powder after a little: and if it has already changed air, then put on to it some ointment, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If however the wound is large, or is from an incision of a sword, and similar: and if its lips do not come together by means of powder, then bind it together with a suture, according to which I will tell about the sutures in the wounds of the feet concerning their sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If however the wound has already touched bone, and hangs down, and there is no retention of it, unless in a small suspender: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicine, and restore to it hard flesh at the place of skin, and order the sick person to eat food in which there is grosness, such as are heads, and boiled wheat, until he is like a pulse; and give them similar food.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	That if the wound is in the skin and does not adhere to bone: then cut off the entire putrefied part, and throw it away; then care for it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if there is an artery or a blood vessel that flows from the wound and does not break open with medicine: then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If then you do not cut it but dry it with pitch or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if necessity requires when it does not give what I have said, then causticate it, until the blood stops flowing.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small and simple, then the matter of them is easy and light: so that powder applied to them turns them into powder: for they harden before they change with air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The method of Powder for Inguinal Wounds.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take a part of olive oil, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of burnt lime: grind them all together, and sift them: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good constriction, until it adheres well to the place, and clings with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it from above with powder, and leave it, and do not remove it until it has hardened so that it does not move.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine will not drive it out until it is cured.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it has done this by itself, for you do not have olive oil and dragon' s blood in front of you at the moment, and it does the same operation on many large wounds, when it is put on them and bound, and they are recent wounds with their own blood, which does not change with air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	That if it has changed them at all by a certain change, especially when it is in the season of summer, then this powder's intention is not in position: so take care to put on them such an ointment as is digested: or put on them a poultice made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the remaining wounds, until they heal.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If a fracture indeed occurs with an injured bone and is small, then extract it with the Wrench: I will already say about curing fractures of the skull as it will happen.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	The following are the words "Regarding wounds of the neck".
Caput LXXXV.	[Curing] a fracture of the skull.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If an injury occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment when it is between the neck and when it is a simple injury to the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if a cut has already occurred in the nerve of the neck, or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in its treatment unless it is used to produce a sharp constriction, like tar and bandages, and for this and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm nerves and make them bruise.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold at all on a wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is an excellent member: and let that be treated by doctors with a lubricating agent, like lead mixed with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rose water, and resin, when it is washed even with sweet water: and also with various minerals, in this way, and wet ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then apply suture: or cover its lips with powder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the injury itself, until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if an injury is deep, or has occurred a cavity in the lower part of it in which pus has already accumulated, then pierce it in a depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If a cut has already occurred in the nerve of an artery and its flow of blood is followed: then separate it, dry it, or tie it: or burn it, if necessity demands to do so.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the spondylitis has already occurred, or is complete, and the back seems bent: then bring together the skin around it with a suture on a thread, and do not touch the spine, but reduce the wound to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind him firmly with a ligature, and leave him for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals over.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the injury has already made an impression on the bone, then examine the wound: if there are any fragments of bone, remove them all, or as many as you can: and if it is not prepared [i.e., ready to be treated], leave it until the injury putsrefies, and separates and comes out with the discharge.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the injury is new, then dust powder over the wound which you have wrapped.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If it is a wound that has become a fistula, then care for it with the treatment whose reminder appears in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On wounds with spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If the wound is from a lance or a knife, and you can see its depth, then examine it carefully.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If the discharge from the wound is pus, and it smells bad when it lets go, then know that the wound is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is fresh with its own blood, then do not put powder on it at first, nor bind it tightly, so that the blood does not stay in its depth, and go to the heart, and cause it to be sick: but put attractivo ointment on it, and loosen it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If the attractivo ointment is not present with you, then put a well-oiled cloth on the wound to suck out what comes from it due to moisture: and let the sick person sleep on the wound so that what accumulates in it may run out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If the wound has been there for three or more days and there is no sickness, no tremor of the heart, no tightness in breathing, and other good signs remain: then know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it and with ease, and with the rest of the cure, until it heals over.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the healing is excused and it has already opened always, then you shall know that it has already become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore heal her herself from this chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut or an incisor and it is simple on the surface of the breast or back: then heal that itself with what preceded it from suture, if it is great: or with dust, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone and incised from it a strap: then inquire about the wound, and approach to remove those straps, if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separate, then let them go, until the wound rotten, for the extraction of them is eased.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But of the remaining wounds and accidents in the remaining members, the judgment in the cure, is the judgment of her who we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Regarding wounds of the belly and the exit of the intestines and the emergence of them.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture which has happened to the belly is great, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	So then from what concerns the great and when the intestines have emerged, or the number of them.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why does it happen to fall in them, and their suture more difficult and harder?
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small rupture also is difficult from a different way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	So then, as it concerns the reduction of them, if you do not hurry to return to its place immediately after its emergence: for it swells up, opens up, and grows greater: why does it become difficult to enter it?
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	So then, for this reason, the rupture which is medium is better: because when it is not difficult to reduce the intestines, as it happens in these two cases.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of the wound is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	The two common sutures meet together in the suture of the belly, and in the suture of the remaining wounds of the body: and the two other own sutures communicate to the rest of the wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	Indeed, they are more appropriate with the stitching of the wound; and I tell you both with explanation and demonstration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say, because when the wound is small, and something has come out of the intestines, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is for two reasons.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said; Or because there is swelling in the intestines from cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is like that, then it should be heated, so that it is immersed in a sponge, or a wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you boil it in water with squill, and hyssop, and a spice, and steep it with it until the swelling subsides.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When therefore it is good for the wound to be stitchy: and it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see that the swelling has already resolved, then wet the intestines with the water in which it was boiled, or make it bitter.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by this the entrance is relieved when it is small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however the return of the intestines is excused after this treatment, then find a little disruption with the instrument with which they are cut out.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than cutting; and there is no compulsion to cut after need and failure of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be curved, acute, and the other not acute, and the end is not sharp with Spatulim's sharpness, but rather blunt a little; and it is like a cauld, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound is enlarged and the intestines are drawn in, then it should be reduced according to its own natural form in its own place, if possible above that; for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When therefore the disruption is wide in the lower part of the abdomen: then it should be laid down on its back, and its legs should be made higher than its head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the leg, then put its head, and the chest of him higher than his lower.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And likewise if the fracture is in one of two parts of the leg, then put your intention, and your thought always on this, that the part that has the injury should be higher than the other side.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it should be, so that you administer that in large wounds, and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, put that according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it present between your hands the faithful minister who holds all the fracture in his hand: and open his lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then detect from him the one who follows, a piece of thread after another: and this is the way of common surgery of one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, so that you take them quickly, or a number of them according to the quantity of the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the end of the fracture a quantity of the index finger, that is, the doctor: and fix now one after you put in it the thread in the two ends of the skin, with both ends of the scaffolds that are under the skin from inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already added the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the scaffolds: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with a double thread around the needle from both sides at the same time, until the two lips of the wound have been added according to the falling.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go the thickness of the finger as well, and fix now another one: then make it straight with a thread, as you did with the first.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Nor therefore stops doing that with him when you stop from the needle, until you complete the constriction of the wound in its entirety.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And there is a medium needle between the thickness and the subtility: because the needle with subtlety cuts quickly through flesh: and the thick ones are difficult to enter into skin: for this reason, so that they are medium in subtility, and in thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not appropriate that the needles be placed in the two extremities of the skin near each other: so that the flesh does not rapidly hurt, and the wound before its consolidation, and also with the stitch, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the end of the needles so that they do not hurt the sick person during sleep: and place on them little pieces of cloth from all sides that hold the ends of the needles: and let them go until you know that the wound has been consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of stitch with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since it suffices in the stitch of these needles one, or two, or around them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But the second common stitch is to join with the stitch the four ends: the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the thread in one line, with a needle of equal thinness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you pierce with the needle the four ends, bring it back from the part from which you began in the same way, so that the thread is caught on the top part of the skin: so that the stitch remains, as it is when the cloth is sewn by a piece of cloth, and put between each stitch the thickness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This type of stitch is known to men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch I sewed for a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded by a knife, and the wound was bigger than a palm: and came out from the intestines around two palms from the middle intestine, and the break was in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	So I reduced that after he had stood for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	So the wound had been consolidated in the space that was about fifteen days: and I nursed him, and he recovered: and after that many years he lived, living in his own affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And from a miracle it was that I didn't cure him with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where no ointment was found, nor any medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	So I put on the splint twice a day with ointment and washed it with honey water until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	But two kinds of stitches are mentioned by the text: those that use what is proper to them, according to the description of the text.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is so, as you begin with the sharp stitch: and you insert it from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle therefore enters into the skin and goes according to its length and width through all of the body: release the tip of the needle in a place where you have inserted it, so that another may penetrate from the inside part to the outside at another extremity farther on.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extremity further on from the outside part to the inside: and release the tip of the needle, which is in that place, so that another may penetrate from the inside part to the outside at another extremity farther on. And when you have made it penetrate with your penetration so that it penetrates into the tip of the needle, which is in that part, until it penetrates all of it: then release the tip of the needle and make it repenetrare in eam extremitatem, donec totum corpus penetret.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also begin from that same part, and draw it out with its extremity, which is from the tip of the needle in that other place, and remove now the needle from the skin as far as it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then also reduce it into that skin, and draw out the tip of the needle from the opposite part to this extremity with the same mirach: and remove it from the skin which is in that part, and make it bend one way and the other: and make it bend after bending, until you have finished all according to the said example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the height of this stitch is so that its stitches overlap the skin like the skin: so that its tip of the needle bends one way from one part of the skin: and so that you release it bending the other way from another part, until you have finished it all.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	Second type of stitch, which Galeetus said was his own.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This speech was told as such, so that it would join all parts in accordance with nature: and apply the edge of the needle to one end, and the edge of the thread to another end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is how I will tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You must fix the thread at one end near to you from the outer side and let it penetrate into the inside in that place: and release the two ends of the needle.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the thread around, and let it penetrate from the outside to the inside at both ends of the needle, that is to say, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both of them around, and also let them penetrate from the inside to the outside at both ends of the needle, that is to say, on both sides opposite each other.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this way of stitching is better than the common easy one, and it is a stitch whose predecessor's memory you just recalled.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore Gale's speech as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The stitch of the hand should be with two thumbs.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, so that you put one thread into them both: and begin with the insertion of the needle, since it is with you, and let it penetrate to the other side according to the stitch of those who make their stitches equal.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when the break is in the middle of the hand: then the stitch of it is more difficult than at other places of the hand.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	However, the judgment of surgery on wounds, is the judgment of the rest of the wound.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, for when you have just gained a wound with its own blood, before it has had time to change itself; and reduce the intestines, and their contents, and prepare the body: then place on the dust of carnation.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already changed the wound: then place on the body a kind of ointment that is present with you, so that it makes pus: and let the threads fall, and harden together needle-stitches, and fasten together needles.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then this cure is to be used as a treatment for the other wounds until they are healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you do not have the present medicines, then immediately place him on it, so that it starts to emit pus, and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until he is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you will not need any other medicine in many cases when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you are feeling pain that affects the main members of the body in an injury, then it is necessary to dip the wound in oil with a moderate temperature, or in rose oil: and place it around the areas between the hips, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	For if he feels pain, or twitches, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then make a enema with black ochre, warm wine: especially if putrid matter has already entered the intestines and has caused painful twitching.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And you should know that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal: and what comes from the small one is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine which is called the small one does not accept healing from any wound that has happened in it: and this is because of its multitude, since it is made of fibers, and its size, and because of the fineness of its tissue, and the closeness of its nerves to each other.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if the wound that has come out is sharp, and you have managed to control it: reduce it according to your ability, so that you make the intestines equal in length.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if there is a distance from the wound, and it has already turned yellow, or black: then you should tie it up with a thread above the place that has become dark, so that blood does not flow out.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the small intestine there are arteries and veins.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut that ligament which is beyond the wound, and place two ends of a thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside the body: so that it will relieve itself from you by attraction, and remove it from the area where the small intestine is bent, and emit pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A reminder about the wound that occurred in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a disruption occurred in the intestine, and it was minor: then it is possible, for some people to be restored: because I saw who was wounded in his belly with a lance thrust, and there was a wound on the right side of his stomach, and an old wound: and a fistula was made, and went out from it, and there was vomit.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I therefore applied the treatment, until I was not confident in his recovery: and I did not hesitate to examine him, until he was healed, and the site had hardened.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place now consolidated, I feared for the disease, that a bad accident might happen in his belly: and it did not happen to him from that accident at all.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better health, eating and drinking, and enjoying himself, and entering a bath, and exercising himself in his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters said, because when it happens in the intestine a wound, and it is small: then it should be bound according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, so that you take the great head of ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then aggregate the two lips of the wound, and put one ant on them which has an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	So when you come to it, and he tightens his mouth on them, cut off its head, because it adheres to them, and does not come off.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then put another ant next to the first, and do not cease to make it with the ant after the second amount of wound on the whole.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce the wound, and tie up his wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	Those head parts remaining next to the intestine, until it is fed into the intestine, and heals, and does not cause any damage inside.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is possible, that the intestine be bound also with a thin thread: which is taken away from the intestine of the animal, joined to it after it enters into the sack.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, so that you may take hold of the end of this son's intestines, and there is much excision.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then bind with a thin linen thread the end of this son's intestine.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce that thread into the cavity, and draw it out with it the intestinal contents.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce the person to his right senses.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with the needle and thread is not worth trust or hope except as a last resort.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You should know that the wound is a large one, broad especially if it is in one of the thin intestines; then it is not a question of skill but of carefulness and there is no cure at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	As for the care of Zuchiemen and Fistulae.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head LIIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You should know that any wound, or ulcer when it is old and has become dry, and is always discharging pus, and does not close: then it is called a Fistula everywhere that it may be, and we call it Zuchiemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a Fistula is, according to the duration of its duration, a filtered, hard, white nodule; with which there is no pain, and whose concavity feels sharp-edged: and because of this one is called by some Risati, that is, a needle.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in some hours moist, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps it splits the moisture in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And when this moisture is much, and it is little; and it is thick, and it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already precluded in the division, then when I said wounds, that every wound which does not heal, and does not form flesh, is not anything but because of a new cause of disease.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of these is, or because of the lack of blood in the body; or because of the wickedness of it; or because it is between itself and over its lips hard flesh, preventing the formation of flesh; or because there is much dirt and filth; or because the wound is putrid within itself, and the matter which it discharges is of bad quality; or because the remedy is inadequate in its cure; or because corruption from a fall in the region is a kind of pestilence, or through property in the region, as happened at Caesar Augustus: in which it is difficult to digest ailments, and late in its cure by nature: or because there is one hole, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown you all the causes and signs of these conditions, and their treatments with the physicians separately: and it is necessary here that I make you aware of the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done through a surgical incision with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	So know, then, that Fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	Namque ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifacos; aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis; aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi; aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione; sicut manus, et pedis.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which then of these Fistulas is from a difficult disease, and does not receive a cure, and the occupation with it is labour and ignorance. Aliquis enim ex his qui in prope uena magna est, vel in neruo, aut in sifaco, aut in intestino, aut in uesicada, aut in aliquo ex costis, aut in aliquo ex spondilibus dorsi, aut in aliquo iuncturarum compositarum
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	That if it is from any of these Fistulas whose depth does not reach these places which I have said: and you hope, and you trust in its cure, and you seek to understand it, then you accept a trial from brass or iron, if the Fistula extends according to a straight line, and you examine it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is tortuosity in the Fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead, with its leniity, allays itself to the body, and seeks after any tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	That if the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate it with a lead probe. Alium enim ex tentis, quae sunt ad hoc usadas, est cuius modus ut in fistulas perueniat qui non habeat orificia
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	So then, of the probes which are used for this purpose, there is one who can penetrate into Fistulas which do not have openings - a probe of lead: so that it
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	So then, of the moisture which causes the lead to spread towards other openings, and it runs from them. Et quae peruenit ad haec loca, non est in eum uolgitur, sed in prope uena, aut in nerv
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then go and inquire carefully how it is possible for you: to know that there is a mouth or a nerve, and the fistula is remote or nearby: or a single fistula whose openings are many, and is located over all of it with great strength of yours: in your question, which you ask about the sick, and find pain in compression with your hand on the place, and similar signs and causes of accident apostemati.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have thus stood firm on all these stations with true stability, then go to cure with confidence: and is, when you consider then, if it is a nearby fistula that appears, or in a healthy place far from the joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or new, or one of the places I told you: then dry up the fistula according to what has been said in my story, and take out what is in it from filtration, and rotten flesh, which arises in its opening from flesh, or the membrane, and similar things: and cure it, until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is a deep one, and is straight: then it must be cut off in depth as much as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then clean it out of all its corrupt flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then add a liquid in which the acute medicines are dissolved: and introduce it up to the depth of the fistula that you have held with the iron: do this several times, until the acute medicine corroded all that remained in the depth of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with an ointment that generates healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal by this, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	But if the cause of the fistula is a mouth, and it is certified with you that it is: then ask about it, and dry it out according to what I told you: if it does not forbid you anything from the small entrails, or a nerve, or a main member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore an oss is found in thee, and there is some corruption therein, and it turns black: then saw it off, until the whole corruption be taken away from it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	And then take care of that which is ingrown with him, until healing takes place.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal, and it discharges pus as before: then you shall know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore detect on top of him again, and examine whether there is any rational explanation for it, and with your last strength clean it up thoroughly.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore him.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If he then heals, it is good: and if not, then you shall know that that corruption is in the depth of the body far from you, which you have not been able to reach.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is therefore not in your power to do so, unless you let it go by nature's law.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the corruption is in a small oss, and it is possible for you, attract it with subtle hooks which are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then examine how to attract them all, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If however there is opposition to you from any moisture, and it is not in cutting them, neither fear nor mistake: then cut off those moistures and the flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If however you are not prepared to remove the bones from your time, then place over the bone that it may rot: and leave it alone, until that which is in the surroundings of the bones from flesh and moisture has rotted.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the bone so that it does not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And constrict the incision which you followed in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	At the bottom place over the bone, if you wish, soaked three times with oil: or soaked three times in Egyptian ointment, or some other type of ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those moistures are rotting, and the bones separate from them, their removal is eased, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if it is one large bone, such as the femur, or the pelvis, and similar to them, and that which is rotten from it is a great part: then cut off the whole last by means of a saw, until that blackness and corruption are taken away.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the bone.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If, however, what is rotten in it is a great part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw off the whole thing, and to cut into it all the way until the place where the corruption stops: then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you about the wound that happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may have an example and an aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	He was a young man of about thirty years of age, to whom a pain occurred in his thigh, from a cause that moved from the inside towards the bone, that is, from within, until it reached the bone, and there were blisters, which were great: but there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Then a long time passed with the mistake of the doctors until the blister opened, and many substances came out with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was postponed until the thigh was wrapped up, and many holes were made in it: all of which discharged pus, and wetness from the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	He was treated by a number of doctors for about two years, and there was no wise man in art of hands, until I was called, and I saw his thigh, and the substances that were flowing from those holes in great course: also all of his body was very much swollen, and his color was cerulean.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Then I inserted my finger into one of the openings, and it came to a bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I scrutinized all the openings: and I found them reaching to the same place from all parts of the thigh.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Then I dished it out, and I followed the path of one of those openings until I discovered a bone: and I found that part rotten: which was already rotted, and deteriorated, and pierced through, until it penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore took the piece that had been found and prepared it from a corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I thought that there was nothing in the bone but that corruption, which should be cut off, and then I fixed it together.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I have already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed the restoration of the wound with long-drying glue.
Et non est consolidatum.	And is not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried it, and I found on top of the first detection: there was a continuing corruption with bone: and I fixed it together, because it also appeared to me from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I therefore took hold of it again, and did not cease to cut the bone in pieces, and tried to restore it: and it was not restored until I had cut out a little palm from the bone, and pulled it out with its medulla.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with glue, and it was quickly consolidated, and healed: and this repetition of the operation and sectioning of it was not necessary, unless for the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of tolerance, and my fear over it from death: because it happened to him in all times from a bad syncope discharge.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He therefore healed with an intact healing: and bone grew up in its place, and its disposition in his body was good, and his strength returned: and he recovered in his dispositions: and he did not do him any harm at all in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If, however, the bone is broken high up in the body: then you should fix it together, according to this manner: that you take a ligament, and tighten it at the end of the prominent bone: and you order someone who will stretch it upwards: and put another thick ligament onto it first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind the bone together on top of the flesh that is attached to the bone: and extend its end so that you pull the flesh down below: and you cover the flesh over the place that you want to fix together, so that it does not hurt the saw when sawing the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood or a board beneath the affected bone; for when you do this, it is not forbidden that you may cause pain to the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that a lock be placed upon the place of corruption to some extent, so that the corruption of the bone is not in danger; and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, but prompts to its own lock by another means.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	That if the bone is corrupted and it does not rise up, a part of it continues with another part; and corruption is in its middle or in some part of it: then you will find flesh from all its parts.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood beneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then make the lock from the first part where there is corruption continue to the second part; and place the lock according to the length of the corruption, as I have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	That if corruption is at the joint, cut that joint which is corrupted, and make the lock of the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no intelligence in that but a scar.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	That if corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the palm of the foot: then the matter is difficult to understand.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary for you to inquire how corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And cut it and clean it according to whatever arrangement you can make possible for yourself, and with whatever intelligence it corrects itself for yourself; when it does not give you a contrary vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that the incisions and locks to cut these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their roughness, and their subtlety, and their magnitude, and their size, and their variety.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that you prepare any instrument of the kind suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations mean to you according to the appearance of the instrument in which you work, when you have a long study.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And know the ways of this art, the witness of the modes of sickness; for then indeed you will find that which is fitting to him from the instruments for every sickness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you shall place before your eyes as examples on which you shall operate, and trial that you have experienced on others.
Forma Serrae.	Form of a Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of a Saw other.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of a Saw other.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the Saw depicted, sits slightly askew.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let the blade of his arc be made of steel: and let the handle be made of wood, and sit slightly askew.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Form of Scissors joined.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this Razor be formed according to the form of a star-shaped claw: and let its edges be formed according to the form of dots of an elk's horn.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not fitting, unless they are joined with him, the heads of the scissors, when they are corroded, or a wide and great hole, and it is large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Form of a larger Razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Form of a medium Razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Form of a wide Razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Form of a Razor, in which is built-in.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Form of a thin Razor other.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Form of a Razor other, with curved extremities.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Form of a small, thin Razor for the tip of the finger.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Form of a Razor, with which you operate on bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Form also of a large Razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to the awl, and its end is like a Saw: it exhibits itself in many places from the cutting of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Form of a Razor, which is suitable for the piercing of his bone.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	End of him triangular, its ends are acute.
Fit ex Indi.	Suited from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise it is necessary that all which we have said of the Razors, and Scissors, and Saw be.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the incisions of the limbs and on the locking of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities may become putrid, either through an external cause or through an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	If, however, you have treated the corruption with medicine, and it does not respond to treatment: and you see that corruption is affecting a limb, but it does not affect any other part: then you should cut off that limb as far as the corruption extends, so that the sick person may be cured by it, or by the greater harm of losing the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that this happens is that the limb becomes discolored, until it putsrefies: either because fire has scorched it, or after it has become black from corruption: until the putrefaction extends to that limb, and spreads throughout the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, when you make the incision, and likewise if the cause of the corruption is from the percussion of certain venenosos [venomous plants]: such as the sea scorpion, the horse-mussel, the mustard, and others.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If, however, the corruption or the percussion is at the tip of a finger, then cut off that finger, and not leave any space for the corruption, so that it may be cut off up to the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And likewise if it happens in a hand, then cut off that hand from the root of the nail, and not leave any space for the corruption, until it takes hold in the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it has lodged in it, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If, however, the corruption passes through, and you see it around the elbow: then death is in that limb.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And administering other than this medicine, is a matter of dosage.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And likewise do for the foot, if the corruption has lodged in a finger, then cut off that foot from the ankle joint: and if it has lodged in the shin bone of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If it has risen up to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no hope for recovery, only amputation and abandonment to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way to incise the limb, or to sever it, is to grasp the lower ligament, which you wish to incise: and seize a second ligament above the spot.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And extend one minister of the ligaments downward: and extend another minister of the ligaments upward upward.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you shall separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a sharp blade, until the whole flesh is separated.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it shall be incised, or severed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And you should put a cloth over all the parts, so that the blade does not touch the sound place: and it shall happen to the sick with added injury, and feverishness.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, there should be a flow of blood inward while you are operating, then quickly cauterize the place: or put some dust upon it which stops the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your own medication, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament, and take care of it, until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this same thing that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happened in his black foot, with the scorch which resembles the burning of fire: and that corruption first began in his toe, until it covered his whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Then that man came forward of himself, after he had seen the corruption inciding in his member with its swiftness, which he knew from its pain and scorch: and he incised himself at the joint, and was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after he had passed a long time, that corruption happened to him again in the same way in his little finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Then he came to me, and I tried to restore that excess with him when I put on the hand with medicine after washing his body: and that excess did not recur, and it began to incise in another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	I therefore held him by the hand to examine it; and I did not wish to do so, hoping that there would be no excess of blood from his wound; and I was also afraid of death from the incision of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the strength of the man was greater than the danger.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	And after he had despaired of me, he turned back to his own country; and he came to me because I desired him, and he struck his entire hand on mine; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not brought this story forward except as an aid to what is about to happen in this type of illness; and that it may be a sign, and according to which it occurs.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Regarding the treatment of gangrene, and the quality of clotting with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 100.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When gangrene occurs in some fleshy part of the body and the space of gangrene is prolonged until it forms a clot: then it bursts, or pierces, and what is in it comes out, leaving a hollow place like a wound; and the skin that is on top of it looks like a thin cloth; and does not penetrate to its ultimate corruption, nor does it enter the mouth, the nerves, or the ligaments: it deserves to be called Sinus: but it is not so named; but if it continues to prolong, until it penetrates the corruption into some of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or a pus-hole.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the care of it is that you strike off all its skin as if it were unwound; and above all when it has become thin, and looks like cloth; and trust that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere and not follow that last consequence of corruption: and if there is a thickness of flesh on the skin, then treat it with Clister; and you are to consider as regard Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that is discharged from it has a foul odor; then clisterize it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and zinc, taking equal parts, mixing them together in wine; and let them boil on the fire until they turn red: and make them into a paste of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from him what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clisterize it with the sinuses: and tighten the opening of it, and let the medicine go into it for the quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract him with an expression: let him be days until the sinuses are cleaned up and the foul smell is gone.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes when it is clisterized with black water, when this medicine is not present with you: and it is, so that you take the ash of wood that has been burned, or the ash from oak wood: and you pour it over her water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then dip it, and clisterize it with it until you are sure that the sinuses have been washed away.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	That if the sick person does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or water of ash, then clisterize it with water and honey, in which there is already some crushed zingiber mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clisterize it with honey and wine because the property of honey is that it cleanses and washes away, and the wine makes the sinuses adhere, especially when there is an abundance of astringency and dryness in it.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do this sometimes, and are sure that the corruption of the sinuses has already gone away: then clisterize it with him so that he can generate flesh in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is so that you take from the plaster of dyphpine: and dissolve it with rose oil, and wine astringent: or clisterize it with some other medicines, and with ointments, whose properties I have written in the book of ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	That if the opening of the sinus is tight, in which the tube of the clister does not enter: then increase it with a little iron: or put in it the licorice that is soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in basilic ointment, until it is increased.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the opening is also wide, then join the lips together with a suturing thread: and let go from it the quantity that enters the clister without adding anything to it.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And likewise if the opening from which the infection flows is raised higher up: then dry it off in a lower place that is in itself, so that the infection may flow out of it down to below: for when the infection is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents meat from growing in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to dry out the sinus all around below it according to your wish: then be careful, so that you prepare the limb with preparation through which the infection may flow out of it easily according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Be careful that nothing of the pus is left in it at all: and take the solid medicines which are placed over the wound, fitting for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over the cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And have a cloth of such a quantity that it may come into communication with all the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps in the direct opening of the sinus a hole, a little larger hole.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the unguent a soft cloth over another cloth according to the quantity of the hole: and place it on the limb in a distant position from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it may be facilitated: and do not remove the large cloth until after some days.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But that which is over the opening of the sinus, is he whom you stir up every hour, so that he moves out what is gathered in it from pus: and know that the infection which flows out of it, is very much or little: or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this repeatedly consider the place of the sinus itself, whether it feels pain in its lord or not: and whether there is no pain in it, and whether there is a swelling in it, or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	And when you extend your medicine so, and see the matter which flows out over the opening of the sinus: then know that the sinus is already attached, or is approaching attachment: so then dissolve it in the morning, or in the third day: and when you have dissolved the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the unguent.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if it is discharged from the Sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherentium, for the cure approaches, because there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and from them come those who act opposite to it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if it is discharged from the sinus after many days of pus, then you should know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	But if the adherentium of the sinus is delayed, and its duration is prolonged: then add to it, that doctors may make medicine, so that it is in its substance moist and in its virtue dry: like the unguent of dyafinicon, when it is added to it superfluitas additionis ex zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the greatest last, when it is cured, it is, that you take the unguent of dyafinicon, and dissolves with olive oil, and drips on the old wine with equal substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then put it together with it, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And also does this action similar to this, when the unguent of dyafinicon is not present with you, honey, when it is heated, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh and aloe and olive oil: grind them all together, and powder it over honey while it is on fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then tie a cloth over the wound and tighten it around the sinus: and grind with honey that you have prepared, until it has thickened: and powder the species on top of it, and put it on the cloth, and tighten it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when these are administered to it, the long arnebia, and the roots of the star lily, and is a lily: and flour of herbs, and centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or mixed together, grind it up, and sift the powder over honey that you have prepared, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the duration of the sinus is prolonged, and it does not heal with this cure: then you should know that there is corruption in its depth: or it already makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard parts of the body, or ligaments: then care for the wound with surgery, as has been stated.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the treatment of a sprained ankle and a sore toenail, and the addition of a cut finger and an incision.
Caput XCI.	De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	On the treatment of a sprained ankle and a sore toenail, and the addition of a cut finger and an incision
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	If it is prolonged and neglected in its treatment, and becomes inflamed, or putrid, until it corrode the nail-root: and perhaps it corrupts all of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the mouth, until there is a foul odor; and the end of the finger becomes swollen, and its color turns black.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you treat it then, with the same treatment as we have spoken of in the division, and your treatment does not help: then you should cut away the whole excess that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then anoint the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	The cautery of a wound is very strong.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If the mouth is healthy, and the nail also is healthy, and the little additions of the nail are pressing on the flesh inwardly, and they begin to hurt it: then you should place a very fine ray under the corner of the nail that hurts the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut off the flesh easily, and place over it what remains of the flesh from the medicines burning, and the corrosion, until all of it is moved away.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat that with ointment, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If the corruption has already pressed into the mouth, then you should cut off that mouth, and take it out: for it does not heal at all while there is still corruption in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see the corruption and the corruption spreading in the finger, then cut it at one end, according to what has been said above in its recollection.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat that, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, a toenail is sore or has been hit, and there is a sharp pain with it, then you should first draw blood from the nail.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp chisel from above down to the eye.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And beware that the cut does not go into the flesh under the nail, for you may cause a very painful pain by doing so, and it will be a cause of the birth of flesh added to the place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with the medicine that relieves the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger added which is born in some men's hands, perhaps is flesh all over: and perhaps there are bones in it, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and the birth of some of their fingers is in the root of the tendon, or its birth is in some of its nodules.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	So this one who is born in the nodules of a finger does not move: and perhaps he who is born by the joint of a finger moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, in the case of the flesh which is born, it is easy to cut him.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, so that you might strike him at his root with a chisel.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But the cure for him whose birth is in the root of the tendon is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from cutting him.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that one who is born in a finger at the last nodule, then it should be that you strike the first flesh of his incision round up to the mouth.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then close the mouth with one of those knives suitable for closing it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the man, until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The healing of the fingers which happens from one side to another, often happens or is born from the birth of man, that is, is born with him, or from the healing of a wound, or fire burn, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it should be so that he removes this healing, until the fingers regain their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a chisel, or cloth dipped in rose oil: that they may not heal quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin lead plate, until the place heals as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And likewise if some consolidation of the fingers with the palm should occur, then dry that consolidation, according to how it was prepared and suited to the form of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	On Incision The Fault.
Caput XCII.	Chapter LII. On the Head.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Veins that are swollen and full of melancholy humors, which occur in many parts of the body, especially in the thighs, since they are the main limbs for moving, working and carrying.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary that you should treat the body's discharge from black cholera by a strong emission of urine.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then, the patient's bloodletting should be done in the main room.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these veins with iron is done according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One is that they should be made to sit and black blood should be drawn from them.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein should be ligated and all of it should be extracted.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The sectioning of this is done according to this mode.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Wrap the thigh with hot water until the thick, foul blood resolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tie the thigh of the patient from the upper part of the hip down to the knee with the sutural thread, and tie it up tightly.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry one, two, or three veins that are widely separated.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then ligate it, that is to say, extract blood from the lower part of the thigh in your hand all the way up, and above all, bloodletting must be done to the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the leg down to the toe: until it runs out of blood, as much as you see will be enough, and as much as the nurse' strength can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie it up: and tell him to refrain from foods that generate black cholera, and again to administer urine emission and bloodletting when the veins are filled up, and let him feel the pain of the illness.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation of this is done according to this mode.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Scrape away the crust, if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then insert the finger into water: or wet it with warm water, until it turns red and the veins swell: or exercise it firmly, if there is no water available, until it warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin with a direct stroke along the length: or at the end near the knee, or in the lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with a hook, and scrub the vein from all sides until it appears to touch: and at its appearance, you will see it turn red to blackish-red.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When you remove it from the skin, you will see it white as a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert under it Radium, until it comes out and leaves the skin: hang it with a blind hook, soft.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another section next to that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrub the skin from the top part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then rub it with Radium as you did, and hang it with another hook as you did before.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry another section, or multiple sections, if you can tolerate it.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then rub it and cut it at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then remove it to the section above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this, until you remove it from the upper section; or with higher sections, until it comes out completely; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not submit to you when you try to remove and rub it; then insert a sharp instrument with two strong threads, tie it, and pull it out: or insert under it Radium: and turn your hand around all sides, until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	Then tie it so that it does not cut you.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it cuts you, it is difficult for you to remove it deeply; and it enters into the body and leaves a scar behind it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	So when you have extracted it all: then place it on the wound's site, soaked with wine and oil rose, or oil; and cure it itself, until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vine is contracted, it has a twist to its parts that requires an adjustment to those parts, and it is not like what we said before regarding straightness: then you must find on top of it for all parts of its twist, and places of its adjustment.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then hang it with hooks until you have raised it all: and be careful when you cut through your part above it, or hurt any wounds: because it will be difficult to raise it over yourself, or to extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	Form a shape of the wound when the vine heals.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Form a hook shape.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not curvy like the other hooks, and it does not have a sharp extreme, so that it does not hurt the skin: and it has a dull bend, soft: because if it were thin, it would hit the skin with its thinness: but it has excess dullness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of a vein from the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 83.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is produced in the legs on warm lands, such as the Alps and the Arab lands, and in dry and hot lands that have little tenderness, that is, where no grass grows, nor trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is produced in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from the decay that happens under the skin, just as it happens within the bodies of snakes and worms and scabies, and the worms that grow between the skin and meat.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein is, that inflammation occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then a sore place forms.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to come out of that place of its sore, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	Now then, when this extremity appears, you should fasten a plumb weight onto it; the weight of which is two drachmas and a knot, up to two drachmas; and let the lead hang from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever then this leaves something on the outside, you should fix it into lead, and mark it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If then it is prolonged a long time, then cut away part of it, and fasten the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it away at its roots before it has left all of it.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it will contract, and go into the flesh; and it will cause an ulcer to form, and corruption in the place, and a bad wound.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it should be handled gently, and removed slowly, until it has left all of it, and nothing remains of it in the body; and from this one vein emerges in some men, which is five palms long and ten fingers' breadth across.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has already reached me, for it came out of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it should happen to you during the time of your own treatment: then insert a needle into the hole, and pierce it with a long one, along with the flesh; until all that is in it has come out of it, all of it putrefied: and administer corruption of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	And then take care of yourself in curing ulcers.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and it has many openings, and emerges from every opening a branch.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore take care of herself, as we have said in the division, and with what is added to it.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	On the cutting off above the worms which come out under the skin, and it is called a bad fever.
Caput XCIIII.	Head LXXIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This fever is called in our country Bouine fever: because it often happens to the bouis, and there is one kind of it which springs up between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And he felt through the entire body, ascending and descending: and it was shown to him through the sense of touch during his walk, from limb to limb, until he had finished everywhere where he had stopped on the skin, and he had gone away.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And his generation is from the corruption of some of the humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As do happen worms and snakes, that is, worms and roundworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they are afraid of his malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when he felt through the body, and went up to the head, and came to a place: then perhaps he would open within him, and go out, and destroy his eye: and this has happened many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	But when you are going to care for him, and take him out, then that should not happen except through his sense of touch during his walk, and the appearance of it.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, you need to tie down what is above him, and what is under him with strong constriction by means of a ligament.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry off on top of him, and take him out.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	That if he should sink into the flesh, and not harm himself: then place over the place a caustic with fire, until he dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater than that which he fears is his corruption, which corrupts his eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see him already come to the head near the eye, then tie under him with good constriction by means of a ligament.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry off on top of him, and take him out.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick one should use his own purification, with medicines solving the bad korosive humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him guard himself from foods that generate corruption.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	关于疾病的切开部分纳基尔。
Caput XCV.	第50章
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	这种疾病在我们的土地上被称为纳基尔：并在某些肢体部位痛苦，然后从肢体转移到另一肢体。
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I have already seen him myself, according to what I tell you now.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I am called to a sick woman with some ailments.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And he detected his arm, and saw the swelling of the lung in the vein of the shoulder.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw one swelling run up with a whip, as it runs on the skin, faster than it can be: so that it is like silver running, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	So the pain receded from that spot, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour, and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that he was shaking all over his whole body, according to which I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	So I was amazed at the speed of the changing of its member from one member to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And neither before that did I see this sickness with my eyes in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I saw many, who found pain changing from one member to another: and I did not see him with my eyes, as I saw him in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that was it, unless because the woman was one of those who are found with dry lungs detected by the touch: so therefore this seems to be the reason for the change in sensation.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that those who are delicious and have wet bodies do not appear in this way, by reason of the hidden lungs.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When then you will see his cure, and the patient feels pain: then if it appears to you with your eye, as we have said, then squeeze him above himself, and below him quickly: and dry above himself, until this windiness is driven out: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see him with your eyes: then the cure of the body, and with it that he drives out windiness, and makes them come to a head with pills of fennel, and with those of serapine, and others like them.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter LXVI. On the Extraction of Arrows.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their species and according to the places in which they enter the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Of these arrows there are several kinds, some having large points and some small; some are conic and some flat.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	Of these there are three-angle arrows.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And of these there are arrows with tongue-shaped heads.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And of these there are arrows with spined heads.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	These, however, that enter the body according to the limbs, fall into two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For example, if they enter the main limbs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, and bladder, or similar organs.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	But if it falls into one of these main limbs and you see the signs of death that I shall describe to you, then you should withdraw the arrow at once, for death will soon follow otherwise.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	But if these bad signs are not evident to you and the arrow does not enter deeply into the body, then withdraw it and be concerned about the wound itself.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when the arrow enters the skull and passes through the bone and exits above the brain, it causes a kind of dizziness, and swelling, and trembling in the eyes, and swelling, and spasm, and confusion of thought, and amnesia, and colic.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood will come from the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech will be lost and words destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a white pus-like substance may come from the wound's site.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there will come out a substance similar to meat juices.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	But if you see these signs, then refrain from treating it, and withdraw the arrow if it has not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow that enters the heart are: it is near the left nipple; and when it feels like it is fixed in a hard place rather than in a soft one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps arrows are a movement similar to pulsation; and black blood runs from the ulna.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And then follows that coldness of limbs, and cold sweat, and fainting fits.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	So you see, death has come by all means.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And when an arrow hits the lung, the exit of bloody blood from the ulna; and when the neck is injured, it turns pale, and changes color in the nurse.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out great, deep breaths; and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	That if an arrow falls into the breast-bone, which is within a few inches of the back; then it is near to the ribs: and causes great pain with loud breathing, with gasps: and all the arms tremble.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps it has come out from some undigested food in the ulna.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly and is locked up in it: then some stool comes out from the ulna, or a piece of dung, or disrupted intestine.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope for his cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	That if an arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and proceeds from it something to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the sick; then you know that it is deadly.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The rest of the limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, tongue, jaw, spine, femur, hip, leg, and feet, are saved according to various dispositions; but when an arrow does not hit a blood vessel or nerve, and is not deadly.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I saw such things as these arrows; so that you may understand by this about your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because a man was struck by an arrow in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore removed it from his own side, under the fat of his ear: and he recovered, and there was no harm to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I drew out another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen into his fat under his eye-lid: and the arrow was now hidden, and I did not succeed in drawing it out but for its narrow end, by which it stuck to his wood; and this was a great arrow of the Turks' arrows, with a soft iron; whereon there were no folds.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	So the Jew recovered, and there was no harm to his eye with any harm.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I drew out another arrow from the throat of a Christian man.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And this was an arrow made in the Arab way, and it was one whose end was pointed.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I followed up on it with two other arrows between two guides; and now it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was careful with it until I drew it out: and the Christian man recovered.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I drew out another arrow from the belly of a man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After he had therefore passed thirty days, and there was no change in him with regard to his disposition, I followed up on the arrow: and I was careful about it, and drew it out: and he recovered, and there was no harm to him with any harm.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man whom the arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound was closed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After he had therefore been seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound was closed over it, and the arrow remained within her: nor was there any change in her disposition with regard to her natural operations, and the woman found no harm in him with regard to any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man to whom an arrow had fallen into his face: and the wound was closed, and it remained, not finding him much pain: and there were many such things like these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I drew an arrow from the king's Prince, which had fallen to him in the middle of his nose, and had already declined towards the right side about as much: and the whole arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	So I was called to cure him after the fall of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I then found a very stiff arrow shaft.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I then examined it with a delicate touch, and I did not feel it: but he himself perceived the prick and pain on his right cheek.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	So I hoped that it was the prick from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	So I plastered the place with plaster where there was the attractive and digesting power, confiding to myself that it would heal, and I would see a sign of the arrow so that I could cut it off: but there happened nothing in the place which indicated that the arrow had followed the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	So I kept plastering over him for many days: and nothing happened, and the bone was well hardened by then: but he remained sick because of the loss of the arrow from his space for some day, until he felt the arrow in his nose on a certain day.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me about that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	So I put acute medicine on that bone for many days, until it was opened: and when I examined him, I felt a very slight prick of the arrow which was holding onto the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added more of the acute medicine to the opening of the wound, until the end of the arrow was clearly visible: and there passed by me with him about four months of time.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then when the bone had strengthened, and it seemed possible to me to put my finger into it, and move it, and it would not come out: so I kept up the delicate work, and devised means for it, until on a certain day I came upon it with crooked fingers, according as the shape of them was at the end of the passage, until I drew it out.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I repaired the break.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the physicians indeed say that the nose cartilage is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	So I repaired it, and the fracture was solid, and the health was restored to its whole strength: nor did it harm him in any way at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: that you set down that rule and significance about it which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not to be understood with narration: nor does that book comprehend them, and the crafty craftsman compares little with much: and when he is away, he has what is missing, and finds a new operation and a new instrument for the descent of foreign things of this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	So I say that arrows do not come out of the member from which they are fixed, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite part of the other.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out where it entered, or is an arrow going out in a fleshly place: and is attracted, and goes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	That if it does not obey to go out at the time at which it falls: then you must let it go for a few days, until the flesh that is around it putsrefies: and the attraction of it will be allayed, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And likewise if it is broken into a bone, and does not obey to come out for you: then let it go also for a few days: and again with the attraction and movement every day, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	That if it does not obey to come out for you after a few days: then you must drill in the circle of the arrow in the bone from all sides with a sharp bit, until the arrows become larger.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and pull it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the skull, and has already gone into one of the vents of the brain, and there is a certain accident of those diseases which I have mentioned: then abstain from attracting the arrow, and let it go, until it has become even with that after a few days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	If an arrow has pierced the skin, then death should not be prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	But if the arrow has not lodged in the body but only pierces the skin, and remains there for a few days without causing any harm to him; then one should try to pull out the arrow with tools and draw it out.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is firmly lodged and does not obey you when you try to pull it out; then apply tereba to the place around the arrow, as I have told you: then attend to the wound until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow has already gone deep into the body and is hidden and concealed from sight; then try to find it out.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	But if you feel it, then pull it out with some tools that are suitable for pulling it out.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you cannot reach it due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow deep inside; and there is no bone or nerve or vein at that place: then try to find it out until the wound becomes bigger, so that it can be possible to pull out the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	That if there are ears that hold the arrow, then free the meat that is attached to them from all sides with all your skill and tools; and try, if you cannot bring about the release of the meat in the breaking of the ears or their twisting, until it is released.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you try to pull out the arrow, in whichever part it is, then use your twisted hands with forceps to all sides until you make it come out: and use the finest tools so that the arrow does not break, and so that it becomes difficult for you to attract it and pull it out.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	That if you cannot reach it in one hour, then leave it for a few days until what is around it begins to rot.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: for often the flow of blood causes ease; then apply what I have said in our book on curing; and guard your skill from cutting the flesh or a nerve or a vein.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer art every way which thou canst of the bow of Sagittarius: and let it be with ease, and quietness, or tardiness, and firmness, as I have told thee.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you do when you shoot Sagittarius, so that the injured person is in the same position as was the case with Sagittarius at the fall of Sagittarius in himself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more safe.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if you are not able to do that, then administer what you can of the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the arrow which comes from the opposite side, or has already gone out a little towards the outside: or makes a protuberance at the extreme end of Sagittarius by feeling from the upper part of the skin near it, and you see it protruding: then cut over it, and let the section be according to the quantity that it holds in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then attract it: for it becomes easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until Sagittarius presses upon the bone and strengthens itself on it: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for a few days: then repeat it, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	That if the wood of Sagittarius is in it, then push it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if it has fallen wood, and you can administer the push: then introduce into it the tool that is sharp, so that the sharpness of it enters into the end of Sagittarius: then push it with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if Sagittarius is drawn up, then push it with an instrument which enters into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow glides through it.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	That if Sagittarius is poisoned, then you must, so that the sharpness of the meat is in it, where the poison is: if you can do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it with that which comes to that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	That if Sagittarius is falling in the breast, or in the belly, or in the groin, and it is close to that which you touch with the hand, and can cut over it: then cut off, and cause away from the incision of the vein, or nerve, and take it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then cut the bone, if you see it, and heal that, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the pincers, with which the arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	They should be made similar in shape to the ear, which is made like a wedge: when they grasp on to the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And there are many kinds of them, great and small and medium, according to the quantity of the size of the arrow and its width and the constriction of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of the spur.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the spur is deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the extreme end of the spur like a ray, so that it may be introduced into the hole in the conic arrow, and driven with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This end of the spur is conic like a feather: so that it may be introduced into the hole of the arrow and its impulsion.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	Of phlebotomy of veins.
Caput XCVII.	Head 57.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	There are thirty veins of phlebotomy, from which the custom of bloodletting is made in the body.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of these there are sixteen in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries, which appear at the two temples; and two veins which come from the two eyelids of the two eyes, called the two gaze; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is in the tip of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two arteries are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	These are called Algecirach's veins.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins which are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	But the veins of phlebotomy in the arms are five in all the arm.

The two veins that are under the tongue are a phlebotomy aid: because phlebotomy of the head is to the pre-eminences which are in the throat, and to the ailments of the uvula, and to the ailments of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	On three veins on the bed.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The veins which are used for phlebotomy on the thigh, are those in which phlebotomy is done in all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And phlebotomy from these two ways is done.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or with a phlebotome and piercing to the side of the vein; or with oil to relax the skin; or by closing with a phlebotome and a blade, and this is called Alneous.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alneous is, which is suitable for lancing.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these are species broad and narrow according to the width of the veins and their form; The shape of the phlebotome and the piercing is broad, as you see it.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening closed veins, full, coming from the body, visible, thick, and those which contain thick blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotome is smaller in width, and narrower at the end.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for phlebotomy of thin veins which contain yellow-colored blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	[This is about] Phlebotomy in the Basilica [church].
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilica, which is one of three veins to be phlebotomized, is the right one.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the ailments which are under the throat and neck, because it follows the chest and belly: and it is suitable for a phlebotomist to cut it, so that he may avoid an artery underneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If then one should make a mistake and add to the piercing of the phlebotomy, he will hit the artery, and will spill the flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it should not be pierced with a phlebotome and piercing; but rather cut with the Alneous way.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	That if not the Basilica appears with an obvious sign, then it is necessary to remove it, and to turn it to another one, or to search for some of its branches: or to pierce a place near it, instead of piercing at the branch of the brachial artery.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is clear and cut with the Alnesil way using a phlebotome, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If, however, you wish to perform venipuncture on yourself, then it is necessary to approach the vein before stricture of the brachial artery, so that you may feel the place where the pulse can be found.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with caustic, then move on to the arm, and dry up the vein by cutting it concavely with Phlebotomus Alnesis, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And let not the pressure fall through space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see it, when you tighten the ligament, the swelling at the place where you have marked with caustic, then that swelling is swelling of the artery: so remove it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	That if you see blood rise during venipuncture, like a boy's urine, and it is thin blood, red in color: then you will know that it comes from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore put your finger on the spot and keep it there for a long time, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then tighten the arm and let go of it: and so that it does not move: and so that it stands still.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And so that the person does not move for several days, until they are healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If therefore blood does not cut off and does not stop you: and there is no present medicine for you at the moment of your need, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities will crack, and blood will be cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of an axe, and find it: take half, and tighten it to the place where the vein narrows going down, with ligament and powder up to the next day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	Then if it does not: then take care of the person with the reminder from the place where the powder-cut blood flow was flowing: and cutting off his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small wound, and possibility of the ligament from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On the removal of blood from the urethra by Fuscas.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	But the veins of Fuscas are for phlebotomy, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower body: therefore, because it is composed of the Basilicae branch and the Cephalica branch, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it belongs to the phlebotomist to make a cut above the vein so that he does not bleed from the vein itself, for under it is the nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	But if he adds a cut to the vein when he is phlebotomizing, and it comes upon the nerve, there results a coma, and difficult recovery, and perhaps no complete healing.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some people and is thin, and does not show itself: then you must make your cut with Alne's blade, and remove the nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	That if a vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	But the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is a technique, because it draws blood from the head, and provides for the ailments of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And you should use your own skill in this vein, if you will, to phlebotomize it with oil-phlebotomy, or with Myrtle-phlebotomy: for all veins are healthier, because they are not under an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	But it is necessary for you to do the phlebotomy, so that you ask the phlebotomist only at the top of the lacertus, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm him if, after the first strike, you return to it with phlebotomy from time to time.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	But perhaps he abstains from phlebotomy in some people when not struck first, but it does not harm him that abstention from phlebotomy at some time.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of phlebotomy and cautions to be observed when observing it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality and the accidents of phlebotomy, for you should consider their correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First of all it is necessary that you should know that phlebotomy is not performed unless in the conservation of health, and its perseverance and caution from the occurrence of ailments.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And to be done phlebotomy on one of three which are in the bed, namely Cephalica, and Fusca, and Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And to be done phlebotomy at the beginning of spring on a fast, in ver, and summer: and autumn, and winter after feasting, when there are signs of satiety.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And to be done phlebotomy on the first day, or on the third day after having gone past three hours from the day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But the phlebotomy which is administered in ailments does not have a determined time: but when it provokes convenience and necessity towards it, at night, or during the day, and at any hour, and at all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary that boys should be bled before they are fourteen years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	And woman who is pregnant should not be bled until the fourth month up to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	And elderly people should not be bled if they have already passed sixty years old.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	But when someone is to be bled by whatever method it may be: let him purify his intestines before phlebotomy with a soft laxative, if there is much rubbish retained in them: so that the blood does not attract the bowels of the main members from phlebotomy because of putrid effluents.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	And a patient who is to be bled should not be tired, that is, nausea: and drunkards should not be phlebotomized, until they have removed this from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	And an invalid with the gout.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let phlebotomy be repeated after a feverish illness, and forgetfulness, and flow of blood, and multiplication of copulation, and toil, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and all that dissolves virtue from the body or from an animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider in subtlety of humors before that, if blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if possible is to him that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then bath the water, if not prohibits itself anything: or exercises himself some exercise, to subtilize the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And put phlebotomy its chest in his bosom, about third day, as we have said: and be careful, so that is discharged its chest that day all animal accidents bad: like anger, and wrath, and fear: and all body accidents, like labor, and penalty, and abundance, and those similar.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And make its present these things with which used custom of men from aromatic substance, and odorous matter, and mirth and similar ones by quantity possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then sits the phlebotomator over pulvinar, that is higher than pulvinar phlebotomando: then draws its arm, and rubs it phlebotomator hand itself twice, or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then tie the ligature with corrigia, and wrap it around it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And sit the tightened one temperate, because the tightened one when is unequal, or by superfluity in the tightened one, then prohibits the course of blood: or in the softening, then also prohibits the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the tightened one it is necessary, so that rubs the phlebotomando hand itself simultaneously towards innuem, until are inflated veins, and present to sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then wipes the phlebotomator phlebotomo with little oil, old its own proper.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then puts the finger its index left hand on itself under place whose phlebotomiam it wanted, little: so that does not flee the vein, and strikes a percussion.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because from veins is what inuens like a chord fleeing at phlebotomizing: and from them is that is full of air; and when puts the phlebotomo on it, contrahitur against phlebotomo, and deceives the phlebotomator, and does not open the phlebotomo vein: and if opens it, is tightened: so that therefore it is necessary, so that firm phlebotomizer, and sit vigilant in these things all.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then let the patient lie down.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If, however, a new wound is to be made with a single cut, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then that same cut should be made again in another place below or above it with some haste: if the wound does not stop.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	That if it stops bleeding, or the sick person gets better, then let him be discharged after one or two days, and do not tie up the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps the cold will attract the wound to stop bleeding.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And let no bath be taken.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let the patient's blood be drained again, if he desires it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	That if the opening is small, or the blood runs lightly: and be careful not to let out a quantity of blood that is greater than what you intend: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same hole according to the right order, and add a little more during the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with some haste, before the place stops bleeding; for a bleeding place is unpleasant for many people during the course of an operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you see that the person has already started to bleed, then do not even touch the place above; for it is not good with you to leave anything unfinished.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put something soft on top of the wound; for it smoothes out the course of the blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And is better in this place than oil itself, and than any other oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And administer the same oil to all your bloodlettings, except when it is necessary to stop the flow of blood; and make use of a mixture of alfarache and sage, when put on top of the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is thinned out and made smooth when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	That if a great amount of blood comes out at the place where you are bleeding, or if it is a small opening with a cut, then come quickly and put on top of the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly warmed up: and tie it for an hour: for it will be made smooth.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	It is necessary that you should do this after the blood has come out from herself with her own complement or from another young one.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	That if it remains in the place after some days of blackening, or reddening, it does not harm that one; and if it is scar, put on it something of aloe, or of dissolved myrrh: or some of the juice of mint, that is, of calamus or like it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And indeed many times there occur hemorrhoids and eminences in the bloodletting at the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	So put your hand on herself, then if it is soft to touch with your pressure on herself, then that eminence is a bad one.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Cause therefore that you put on her something of that which we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps it flows from her the blood of an artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster with that which is in it for the stenosis, so that the place heals.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of herself with the rest of the cure, until she is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you should keep from every person all the blood within the quantity of his own virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the bright color on the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let her not come out, until she reddens; and likewise if she appears gross, then let her not come out, until she becomes subtle; and likewise if it is sharp, then let the sharpness be taken away from it.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary that he who is full, strong, and resistant to the extraction of blood should have a single force, so as to increase the bloodletting from a young one, and to be a bleeder on his side; and in him who is weak, to be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he should take himself out in twos, and that there be a tight hole; and it is better that it should be administered in the bloodletting from a young one, so that it is a turned section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this mode of bloodletting is healthier than the flow of blood, and from the incision of a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy, and healthier than the bloodletting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And he who has become accustomed to a syncopation of the pulse should eat a little bread infused with water of grapefruit before phlebotomy; or, if he is warm, then secaniabin: and let him draw out blood into three or four vessels.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if his complexion is cold, then he should take a little bread infused with syrup of myrrh, or with syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or with aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If a syncopation should occur during phlebotomy, and it is due to an exit of blood from many vessels: then he should take, in a cup, water of meat, and syrupy substance that is fragrant; and let him apply aromaticity with aloe, and open his chest while doing so: and let him use the other things which we have said in the division on syncopation from exhaustion in relation to bloodletting.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But he who wants to stop his arm from bleeding and to make his blood flow again: it is necessary for him that the phlebotomy which stops a lot of blood loss be done with small force in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But he who wants to stop his arm from bleeding and to make his blood flow again, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven or nine hours since his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	But he who wants to draw blood from his body in the opposite direction of the part to which it declines: it is necessary that he do this in the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In the body of which there is much blood already warmed and activated, and it causes fever: it is necessary that he leave it from there in a single direction, and draw out a large quantity of it: and make its opening larger until a syncopation occurs: after you have kept all the conditions of bloodletting: and let you place your hand on its pulse during the flow of blood, so that no death should occur at the place of a syncopation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For this reason it happened that when the phlebotomist did not know, and he fell because of negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not appropriate that when you are going to cut the arm and draw the blood in a second, if the orifice of the vein has already been closed, and let the exit of the blood be difficult, so that he presses on himself with sudden motion, and let him bend quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For this is a bad thing, far from it, until you have left yourself, unless the phlebotomist draws blood in a second.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or take away with you the acuteness of phlebotomy that which is coagulated from blood in the orifice of the vein, and put on yourself some dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put on yourself some tar-oil or green-worts, and put the compression on the body part, until blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the vein is already open, then let it go, and do not press on it, until it is closed.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	What if necessity compels to draw blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize the person above that place, or in an arm on another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the vein of the arm is phlebotomized at the place of the foot, and the Basilica, if they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of phlebotomy is, so that it puts his hand in hot water, until he feels a throbbing pain, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then tighten the ligature on top of it with slight compression.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then phlebotomize a second time, gradually, not transversally, and not according to the length: and let the opening be wide, and your phlebotomy let it go a little above the knuckle.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	What if the blood is not coming out, then again put your hand in hot water, and let the blood run into the water, until you satisfy your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the summer days, then you are absolved from the washing of your hands in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed, it is put forth that a great deal of the blood flow is in warm water in the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And phlebotomy of this vein is salutary for all veins, because there is no pulsation under it, nor are the nerves affected.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy of the right hand, indeed, is salutary for diseases of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that you should squeeze the hand with a ligature, or your own hand, after you have put it into warm water, until the vein is contracted, and is evident to the touch.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then phlebotomize it by passing over it.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it entirely, it will not hurt it in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And preserve your hand, so that you do not phlebotomize it again.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under it are the nerves of the fingers bare from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat your hand to the warm water, and let the blood run in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat your hand in warm water, the blood will clot in the orifice of the vein, and the flow will be prevented.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	But when you extract a quantity of blood that is necessary, then put oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not congeal quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise, you should do the same for all the branches that are tight.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The grip of phlebotomy is from the left hand, because it is salutary for diseases of the spleen: and likewise do the same in phlebotomizing it as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The grip of phlebotomizing the saphenous vein is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the womb, and retention of menstruation, diseases of the kidneys and bladder, old sores of the legs and buttocks, and similar ailments from ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of phlebotomy is so that the sick person puts his foot into hot water; and he rubs it until the blood comes out; and he ties a bandage over the foot with a thong.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the vein is indeed at the heel, visible towards the thumb; and many branches come out of it on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	So phlebotomize it either in a larger branch of it or at the heel in a cluster of veins; for it is better and healthier.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you phlebotomize it on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize it across from each other, so that you do not want to wound it: and let the phlebotomist be calm.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If, however, the exit of the blood is prevented, then turn his foot again into hot water; and let the blood not run into it until it has drained out.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	That if the vein that the phlebotomist hits is in the first pulse, then continue with phlebotomy to the upper part somewhat, since the place is healthier and you do not want to harm it out of it when you are pulling from it, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And likewise with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But the location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel from the side of the tree.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the quality of phlebotomy is, to a pain in the leg, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of phlebotomy is, so that the sick person takes a hot bath and it cools off; and he ties his thigh from the side of the tree up to the heel with a long slender string: for it does not appear otherwise because of it.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When then appears, then phlebotomize it according to whatever skill you have possible, or across from each other; and it is better, or as if you had wounded it with an incision, or cut it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For this reason it is salutary; and itself is concealed to a great extent in many men.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	For if you do not inject it and it does not appear at all to the sense: then take some blood from one of its veins and that which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear: and cut off from the nerves, and make it run out a quantity as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then bind tightly, and place flesh over the place of phlebotomy, and squeeze the spot.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Of Ventosaation, and quality of use of it.
Caput XCVIII.	CHAPTER LXXVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Of the ventosations, they are made from horns, and from air, and from heat.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And the ventosation is made in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When with scarification and extraction of blood: and the other is a ventosation without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this ventosation which is without scarification, is in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or indeed it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the ventosations which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood, are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the Ventosation of the Lord, and it is at the end of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and the ventosations of Alhagdahim, and they are two laminae of the neck from the two parts simultaneously: and the ventosation of the mind, and it is under the mandible in the lower mouth: and the ventosations of the two spatulas: and the ventosation of Alachosos at the end of the tail: and the ventosations of the two flames, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and the ventosations of the two crura: and the ventosation of the two cauillae.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And the ventosation also does not extract blood from your small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of this its power does not come from them, as is the case with the phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not necessary that wound dressing be done with fire or without fire in any disease that happens from fullness until the whole body is drained.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity requires wound dressing because of illness or out of custom, we shall administer it at any time in the beginning, in the end and in the middle of the month and at any other time.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is because a person is suffering from headache and vomiting when blood multiplies within him until he needs to be drained by wound dressing, but he does not find it until he has passed stool.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them is the one who finds fullness and redness on his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them is the one who finds itching on his face, forehead, darkness, and numbness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them is the one who scratches the place where he wound dressing was applied.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them is the one whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them is the one who finds blood taste in his mouth, or he spits with his tongue and spits out the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them is the one whose dream multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them is the one who sees blood and redness, killed people, plagues, and similar things in his sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see something from among them, and especially if it is in the middle of the third month: We then order wound dressing to be done after having passed two or three hours since daybreak.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	However, the wound dressing of the nose is: because it brings about headache in the head, and because it drips into the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is necessary that that be done after draining the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this Wound dressing is for the case of phlebothrombosis of the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed to use wound dressing on someone who has a cold complexion, or in a place that is catarrhal.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For this Wound dressing causes a great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	Since they shouldn't use these when their heads are cold and have diseases that cause coldness.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But if a man is patient with it, forgetfulness comes to him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for this reason, it is fitting that you order the person who uses it to put his hand down a little when he is blowing out, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Blowing out, or Al-Kohl, is the place of phlebotomy of Fusca, and phlebotomy of Basilica, and for this reason it confers ash, constriction of anhelosis, and fissures of the instrument of anhelosis, and coughs, and filling.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is fitting that it be blown out by Al-Kohl a little, because if it is put down, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Blowing out, however, is the cause of pains in the head and eyes, and hemiplegia, and perforations, and pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is the place of phlebotomy of Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is fitting that you order the person who blows out not to put his hand on the scarification: lest he strike an artery, and blood flow.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	But if he blows out under his chin, it brings alcohol into the mouth, and corruption of the gingival, and similar ailments that are in the mouth; and it is the place of phlebotomy of Aliherich, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	But if he blows out with a spatula, it brings to Al-Kohl, which is made by reflexion, and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Blowing out from the interior parts of the two foci brings assistance to phlebotomy of the new three, Basilica, and Fusca, and Cephalica: for it itself attracts blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh; and these small veins attract those grosser veins from others, until the attraction comes to the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	It is necessary that you do not let Ventosator go too far with scarification because the place is stripped of flesh and below it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	But if Ventosa goes too far on the back of the thigh, it causes hemorrhoids in the anus and ulcers at the bottom.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you order Ventosator to make the wound large and of brass because the place needs strong suction and perhaps the thin Ventosas break: and let there be a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	But the Ventosas of the legs diminish visibly because they draw blood from all the body and cause old pains in the veins and ligaments and blisters: they bring on periods, and produce both the menstrue and anemias, and excitement; and stand at the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins and the alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the support of the alhorcobeni is near to the support of the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the Ventosas is that you place the wound first in a hollow, and drain with moderate suction; and do not prolong the position of the Ventosas, but put them quickly, and shake them quickly so that the humors come to the opening equally: and do not cease to repeat this and continue, until you see the place already red and swollen, and the redness of blood appears; then therefore scarify, and repeat suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is of tender flesh and rare porridge, should scarify himself once only, not more: lest the place should ulcerate.Et uelos quae sunt corporis uentosa, et qui in subluna sunt, scutiantur sedecem diem, non plus: sed primum ponas uentosam in pratis,
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And let the Ventosas that are on the body, and which are in the belly, rub for sixteen days, not more: but first let him who has the wound make it large, a little more shall he make it: and let him temper suction in ease, and quickness, and shaking.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a thickening in the blood, then it should be cut twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In wine indeed the first opening of the avenue of the refinement of blood, and its hydration: and in the second indeed the close scrutiny of the thorough extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If indeed the blood is very foul, then let the incision be made three times: that the last consequence may be obtained.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And to the last, when we wish to extract blood little by little, or a little less, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	That if we wish to extract blood many times, we make several incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it should be cut deeply; and the equal term in the incision, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which should be administered from oils concerning the positioning of the wind, and what cauterizes the wind.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	IN that which has a thick, tough, dark skin, and whose pores are closed, it is necessary to spread the places of the Wind with open, soothing, relaxing oils: if it is in the time of summer, as is the oil of the alker, or the oil of castor-oil, or the oil of almonds, or the oil of pumpkin-seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then olive-oil, or rose-water-oil, or chamomile-oil, or pomegranate-salt: and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If indeed the excess is thick, cold: then let there be bitter-oil, or oil of myrrh, or white-oliver-oil, or red-crown-oil: and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If indeed the wind is of wide pores, tender flesh: then it should be prevented from oil, and it should be washed with rose-water, or cold water, or spring-water, or pumpkin-water, or porter's-water: and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But he whose blood is of a watery nature, let him wash with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac: and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But he whose fluid excesses are coarse, let him wash with old wine, or with water of samphire, or with a decoction of aniseed, or of camomile: and similar things to these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that the washing-out should be done in a bath, or in a tub; and also that he should receive a medicine after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that anyone should sleep after washing-out.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is needed so that the person may be treated with a bloodletting, or with phlebotomy, before the washing-out?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after this, consider first of all: if the person is cholerical, and the sharpness and inflammation of his blood are increased by bloodletting or phlebotomy; then let him take something cooling, like pomegranate; also lettuce, vinegar, and mint, and mint tea, and fennel-seed.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put on his food dishes of downy stuff, and meats that are wet, and cooked food with apples: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if the person's complexion is cold, let him drink in a cup syrup of honey, or of alfalfa, or of mint-seed made; and he should drink medium-strong wine, which is between old and new: and let him be directed to eat in moderation.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put on his food downy stuff, and birches: and doves, that is, many birds: and let him eat pigeon-meat.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink after washing-out and phlebotomy should be stronger than the food; and let it be given in a cup to some men in a strong wine, or in a medicine of musk, that is, musket, or in alselin water; before the washing-out: and before phlebotomy, or after: so as to strengthen the main limbs, and to refine the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	They should not take it from a hot beverage.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On the wound, without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	But those that are without scarification, and that are put on the skin, and the spleen, and the podagra, and over the bowels, and the places of the ribs, and the side, and the belly: for these members do not bear the scarification above them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought through them, unless it be an attack from the blood of a member to a member: for we put the ventosae over the breasts in a fever of the blood of the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we make use of them, to remove from a member a cold wet pain that is in the member: for we put the ventosae over the bowels, and the umbilicus.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For she tightens the member, and warms it, and takes away the pain for that reason, because she has resolved the uentosity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	And is also put on the ribs, when there happens to them an obstruction, or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For his own virtue of its attraction may possibly open an obstruction, or it removes a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And likewise does when it is put on the skin, and the spleen for the purpose of cooling an inflammation in both: for it cools the inflammation.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these ventosae are administered with a few cuts only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And they are sometimes administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in a fever of pleurisy: and that is, so that the ventosae may be filled, and large, with warm water alone, or with water in which have been boiled the herbs that are suitable.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Form of the winds administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be that of two open fingers, according to which we form it: and let the quantity of it be in the depth half a palm: and let it be in the back of its place, which is around the middle of it, a little hole, according to the quantity that is put into it: let it be made of copper, or of brass, smooth-edged, equal, sharp-edged: that it may not wound the member at its position on it: and let there be in the middle of it a wire of copper, or of iron, where the candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And this well-known wound has now healed greatly, greater than that which we have told, and somewhat smaller than that one, according to the sickness and age of him who used it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the winds of young men do away with them, and some others, as much as the winds of old men, and of great bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of such a wound as this is, that you kindle the fire with the hay, or candle, and place it on the middle of the arm that lies across the middle of the wound, so that the fire does not burn the body of the wounded.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it on the body, and the finger on the hole that I have said, until we hold the wound closed: while we are holding it closed, take away the finger, and the steam will come out through the hole and close the wound at once.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then set fire to the hay according to its habit, and light it again if you like that one.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But in the wound that is being treated with pleurisy water, there is no crosswise arm and no hole; it is not administered, unless it is filled with water and placed on the body only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this wound is the better because it can hold a lot of water.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Of the suspension of blood-sugar.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter LIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Blood-sugar is not administered in many cases, unless the member is unable to hold a wound, because of its smallness, like the lip, and gums, and such things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a bare member, deprived of flesh, like the finger, and nose, and such things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of their use is: that you should take them from blood-sugar which is in sweet water, clean from腐敗.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are to be removed in the day and in the night out of sweet water, until they become thirsty, and there remains nothing in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is to be drained first with phlebotomy, and then with venesection.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the limb well with water until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then bandage the wound.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When it has healed a little and the wound falls, and suction is possible at the site with venesection, then it is more beneficial to treat with bandages; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and rub, and squeeze.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood is prolonged after the fall of blood-letting, and it is a resorption: then immerse a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the resorption comes away.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood increases, then sprinkle powder on top of the wound, crushed oak-moisture, or similar things from astringent: until the blood comes away.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or bandage the place with half-raw herb-juices: and let them alone, until the herbs stick to the place, because the blood has dried up.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if the blood-letting is necessary, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If, however, blood-letting is forbidden by suspension, then wash the place with recent blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or wrap it up now in places, until someone comes out with some of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then bandage them, for they themselves, when they feel some of the blood, stick immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you wish to make them fall, sprinkle on them something from crushed aloe, or salt, or ash: and they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	¶ End of Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	¶ The Third Part of the Surgical Book by Al-Buqā'ī.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	¶ A Universal Discourse on Restoration, Dislocation, Cure of Twisting, and Similar Matters.
Caput I.	¶ First Book.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also frequently necessary in the art of Medicine, and is the restoration of fractures, and the dislocation of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	You know, my son, because the stupid doctors and the laymen have always scorned this chapter of the old book, and have not read its letter.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it has happened that this method from the sciences is hidden from our country.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never been satisfied with it at all, and I was not perfected from it except because of the length of reading the old books, and studying their intelligence, until I extracted the science of them from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then, attached to experience and study, the length of my life passed away.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have now described for you from that all the science that contains my knowledge: and on what concerns experience, after I abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of length, and abbreviated it by the end of abbreviation, and showed it by the end of declination: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments that are administered in it, because it is from the addition of declination, as I did in two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	The highest, and the collections from the broken bones, from which the premise is necessary before we begin to remember the recollections of the fractured members, and many, if each one of them.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the prolog of this chapter, the highest speech and chapters, to which the understanding is considered in the first place of the artisan in the station on their veracity: namely that you, and those who are ready, know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when it happens to someone that there is a fracture, or a dislocation, or a torsion, or a fall: then you should be ready in the first place to phlebotomate him, and to solve it, or both together: if not prevent something, like the strength of virtue: or is he who happened to something from these boys, or an old man going on his knees: or is the time of a sudden fever, or a sudden cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be satisfied with his food, cold odors, and meat of the ears and hair: and prohibit wine, and thick meats, and food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until he is completely well from the fever and no longer has a flow of material into the limbs: then let the sick person return to his usual routine at first with which his custom used to be.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	But when the broken jaw begins to be healed, then it is necessary that the sick person eat food with a lot of nourishment, thick, dark, in which there is moisture: such as food made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of animals, and fish recently caught: and strong wine, and things like them.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regime the clotting of the fracture is speeded, and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that bones which are broken, when they are in the hair of old age and decrepitude, can no longer continue and consolidate themselves according to their nature forever, by reason of the drying up of the limbs: but they consolidate themselves and continue in the end of slowness, like the bones of young children's small limbs.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature joins together a broken bone from every side with some similar glue, in which there is roughness, by which it holds and tightens itself, until it becomes joined together, and tied together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until it allows nothing to its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you put food with a lot of nourishment, in which there are things rough, and moist, and thick, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of limbs: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head-bone: and a fracture of the breast-bone is different from a fracture of the spine: and so all the other limbs are different one from another: and I come to remind you of each species of fracture set out in its own place, distinguished from the others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	They also differ in the types of bone fractures.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Since the fracture is curved, except for what happens to it, stars are not present in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when the fracture is along the length of the bone: and there are fractures that are dislocations, that is, stars, and additions that come from it, such as those found in a reed with the blade held against it to write.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not coming from it: and there is a fracture with the ulna and disruption at the head: and there is a small crack.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And all of its kinds are talents, or their own instruments for repairing it, according to how the memory of it is preserved, separated into its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from this one knows the fracture of the bone, it is its curvature and eminence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	And when there is no movement of the site, then the curvature does not appear and its sound does not sound to you in contact with the bone as it is agitated, nor does it cause a great deal of pain: then it is not broken there, but it may be that there is a curvature or a small crack: so it is not necessary for you to move it at all by your hand, except that you put it on top of it from doctors whose memory comes, after the moment that fits into place: and then tie it tightly with a thin rope.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should know that when the site is curved and divided into two parts, apart from what happens to it, all of its parts move with respect to each other: then it is necessary for you to begin correcting it from your own time before the accident happens to it, making it level before it gets hot.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if it happens to it that it is hot, then let go of it for a few days, until the heat has settled down.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then make the bone level in any way you can with ease and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you should know that repairing it, and making it level, is easier than the bones in which dislocations occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten it up, according to what you remember of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If the fractures are in the bones of the hand or foot, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts, if the hand is there, or the foot: or with your own hand, if the member is small: or with two threads, or a thread and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And your position should be such that you place the member on a place of equality, according to its natural figure, until, when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try, by all means, to make those additions as good as possible, and in accordance with any manner you can in their places: and carefully, according to your strength, so that no pain occurs on the weak part by your operation, or by a fault: and carefully, according to your strength, so that you apply one of two bones to its associate, according to better shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And at that hour, you should try and touch it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If then you see anything different there, straighten it out, and make that equal by the amount of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And carefully avoid rapid extension, and strong compression, as many stiff people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many times such an operation causes burning pain, or contracture in the member: as we have seen that from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then afterwards, after the member has been made equal, and the operation has been relaxed, and the member tightened, and rest, and quietness: and warn against touching the member.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make the member calm, so that it does not move in the hour of its strength, and its sleep during its rotation, and its agitation during its digestion, and all its movements at its last strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And carefully, so that the member's position is not a position from which pain follows.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when it feels pain, or injury, from the position of the member: then you should turn it over to another position from which it does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And because of that, so that its position is equal and straight: so that there does not come about any curvature in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the stricture of the broken member is according to what the bow says.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You should know that broken limbs differ in their length and in their size and shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which of them are smaller, like the arm and the finger and the phalanges and such with them, then it should be so that the wrapping is soft and thin.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But which of them are thick, like the hip and the thigh, then it should be so that there is a thick wrapping for them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	For a wide ligament connects the large member and tightens it equally from all sides, so that it does not enter it with any stain.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after you have drained it to put the healing balm that is suitable for it on it in a thin layer over the break spot.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the ligament over the break spot three or four times, depending on how much the member is stretched, and grasp it lightly with your hand.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go forward with it to the upper side from the break spot, and tighten less than when you tightened the broken place, how much you tightened the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then lengthen yourself with the wrapping slightly from the break spot, and soften the wrap slowly until you take away the full wrap from the broken spot.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another and wrap it over again on the break spot with wraps.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then go forward with the wrapping to the lower side from the break.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your action be in the wrapping and softening of it, according to what we have said in the first upper wrapping.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then put between the wraps a soft cloth or something that is equal to the curvature of the break if there is any curvature: and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then cut off the other one from it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then immediately cut off the equal stars of these incisions if there is no swelling or heat in the place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is inflammation or swelling in it: then put on top of it what sits there, and take away the inflammation; and let it go for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie the stars over that one.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars be made from the middle of the canes, cut, formed wisely: or from wood where cribra are made, which are made from pine, or from branches, that is, palms, or let there be a width in all the stars, according to this form, and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	But it is necessary that the star which is placed over that one, is a little heavier and wider than the others: and the length of the stars should be according to what is allowed by the member in size and proportion.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie the stars with an additional one above it, according to this form and this same shape.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie from above with the branches slightly bent, according to what we said about the tightness: and let it be tight over the place of the fracture more than: and whatever is further away from the fracture, let it be tighter.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And let there be middle rows in thickness and softness, and they are made of soft woolen thread.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the rows are thick, as if they were made from an operation of the foolish surgeons who put their own rows out of place with twisted linen strings, it is a great mistake: for the tightness falls out of its place with them.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And the very fine rows do not agree: because you will not achieve what you want by means of the tightness and these rows.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be a distance between one star and another less than a finger's length.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	What if an infirm person is left to heal under the stars after the tightness in healthy places: then put something soft under them, or red wool, until nothing hurts from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with the ulna, and it has happened that the skin has been torn, I will come to this in the second chapter for its singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you shall know that not every broken member needs to be fixed with strings from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because when the member is large, it should not be placed on top of strings, unless after five days or seven or more, according to your security from the risk of suppuration by heat.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of the ancient bandages which were placed on the fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common abbreviated method of the bandage, for restoring the fracture, suitable for many coverings, especially for women and children; because it does not cause heat or cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is so that you take it from the flour that is kneaded, and it is a dough hanging on the walls of the mill when it moves; and you shall shape it as it is, except that you add chalk to it: and you shall not make its covering thick or thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The other method of the bandage, for restoring fracture, dislocation and torsion.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take myrrh, spikenard, acacia, and resin; and honey, of all of which there are XX myrrh, XV spikenard, and XX acacia; mix them with water of alethah; or with chalk, if the covering is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this bandage.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is a good composition, which restores bones that are broken quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	The other method of the bandage, which also is useful for fractures and torsion.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take honey, myrrh, alethah and chalk; of which there is XX honey, XV myrrh, VI acacia, and XX bulrushes of Armenia; all mixed together with much pounding, and shaped with the fingers; and apply to the body, either with water or with chalk.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	The mode of making plasters to close wounds and separate bones from their places; and it soothes the pain, accident, separation of bone, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take wet wool and immerse it in vinegar and oil cooked: and place it on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And this plaster has no power of restoration, but it is good for soothing boils and purifications; and it takes away its own pain.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The mode of the plaster, which restores the broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of fig and leaves of wild papaw: and dry them thoroughly, and make a plaster with both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The mode of a plaster made short, applied to the restoration of the fracture of a bone; and when you wish to effect the removal of a boil.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take one part of root of althaea and one part of camomile and flowers of chamomile and one part of barley grass; dry them thoroughly, and make them into a paste with wine, if it is not a member being warmed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	But if it is being warmed, then prepare that with water and coriander seed, or with water only, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	The mode of a stronger plaster for effecting the removal, which is more than this one, when a hard boil occurs during the restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take one part of root of althaea and one part of flax seed and bilberry and mealy-mouthed oroborus and samsac and flowers of chamomile and camomile leaves, all of which dry them thoroughly, and make them into a paste with water of willow, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	This entire thing depends on the temperature of the member, and the absence of heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates did not say in his book that a plaster be placed on a broken member, if it has been made with ash and oil; no more than this: he related, that there should be an 중간 between grossness and lameness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galen wishes that plasters be placed on a broken member to effect its restoration, in which there is an drying up of heat, such as myrrh and aloe and olive oil and the like, of which we have spoken.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of poultices which is useful for wounds and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mealy bread and chickpeas and hairs of human teeth or feathers of bird and sea-shells and salt in equal parts: these are to be pounded and sieved and made into a poultice.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	But as for the quantity, depending on whether it is necessary to keep the bandage in place, and then to remove it, consider this, if not pain, itching or movement of a broken jaw from its place does not occur: then do not remove it over many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If however there happens to be a severe itching or disturbing pain or swelling: then attend to it immediately, and remove the poultice at once, and take off the linen cloth: and take a linen rag or sea-sponge wet with water: and rinse out the wound with it in warm water, until the itching is soothed and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the member rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put on over it a linen cloth dipped in vinegar and oil, or olive-oil: and bandage it up for the night, so that he is no longer exposed to heat, and the swelling of the member subsides and the pain is relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the application of the poultice several times a day, and do not tighten the bandage too much at first, and use a light one, until it has healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the swelling, redness, pain and inflammation, and all other symptoms are now completely gone, and you find the poultice comfortable and the bandage not too tight, then repeat the application as before.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If none of the things which I have mentioned happens to the member, do not remove the poultice, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when after twenty days all of that has been resolved according to your observations, as we have said, until such time as the fracture appears to have healed and the clot of flesh over it: also add at that time more bandage than before: and add also to the diet as much milk as he can bear.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If, however, you see the site of fracture drying up and healing more rapidly than is necessary: then know that nutrition must be withheld from it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	So wrap the wound with warm water around it for all six days and then apply a loose bandage.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Therefore, by this operation, nutrition runs to the limb and heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which the blind restorers do from a broken limb, when they do not restore at first, second because it should be restored, and restore according to the tortuosity, is an error from their operation, and a great fear: and if it were right, the ancients would have written in their books, and would have operated with that.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see any trace of this at all, and it is better that this should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Regarding the making of an accident in the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III:
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are various kinds of fractures, and many forms of them: and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture is caused by a blow which passes on to the bone so far that it comes to the sinew, which is beneath the bone, as it does in the wood by an ax: and because of this, this kind of fracture is called the axial fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or a certain blade of a weapon injures some bone, and wounds the face, and does not pierce by the wound to the very end: and this kind of fracture is called a Caloan fracture, that is, an absolute Lobation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, or great, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from a fracture there is a crushing, or rubbing: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also piercing, which is coming near to a flap, which is beneath the bone: or is in the face of the bone: and this kind of fracture among these two fractures is small, or great.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	It is from a fracture that is hidden in bone and subtlety of hair: and it is a small crack, and for this reason this type of fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from them is a fracture that is made by accident, or by the impact of a stone, and similar to it, which makes a layer of bone come inwards, and it is broken like this: such as happens with the bones of the skull when an impact occurs and part of them comes inwards.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And many times that happens to the skulls of wet bones, such as are the heads of boys.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these types of fracture separate and I will not forget them at all in their own place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these types of fractures by examination on them, and inquiry about them with the help of tests, and the removal of the corrupted flesh that is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The species called Capillaris is recognized by the fact that it is found on bone and wiped off and placed above it with a caustic: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the patient's condition: for if you see from the symptoms what it means to be clear of danger, such as with cholera, or its extension, or loss of mind, or loss of speech, or fainting, or acute fever, or watering of the eyes, and their redness, and other similar things from accidents in many ways, there is certainly no hope of recovery: but if you see that the patient does not seem to be frightened by these symptoms, and hopes for recovery, then start his treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is to say, if a person comes to you wounded for the first time: and this happens on the 24th day of the month, then it is necessary that you should study the removal of the bone before the 24th day in all ways.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then you should remove the bone before the 7th day, so that what is underneath the bone does not corrode because of a piece of skin, and those accidents which we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has reached the brain membrane, and is with little effort and attraction, then you should break the broken side, and grind it according to what I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And then you should shave the injured head: and examine the bone according to whatever way is possible for you: and in the form of the wound, and what is higher on the weak one.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	That if it happens to you that there is a flow of blood or pus at the examination of the bone, then oppose it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And that you fill the place with wet cloths in wine, and oiled rags: and make the joint rest until the pus is dried up, and are safe from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the cure of the bone, and removal of it.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done in two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One way is that you break the bone with a sharp chisel: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then take another Incisium wider by an inch or more: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also take another Incisium wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second way is that you have with you a number of Incisoria different in width: some of them are wider on some sides, and some shorter: and let them be at the ends of their sharpness, and be of iron or brass: and use convenience in hitting on the Incisorium, so that it does not hit on the head, and hurts itself.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is strong and hard: then you should bore around it before you administer the Incisoria with those called Terebra not penetrating: and are not so called unless they do not pass beyond the end of the bony part towards that one: because Terebra is a round extremity on that side, under the head, like a margin, and a small circle prevents from sinking in, and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	It is necessary for you to take from these Terribles a great number, each one corresponding to the quantity of thickness of bone, until the present time is completely crânum Terrible: whose extremities are acute in length and brevity, according to the quantity of thickness of his cranium.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three Terribles, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of the piercing in the circumference of the fractured bone is: so that you place the Terrible on the bone and rotate it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the Terrible to another place, and place what is between all the cavities of the thickness of the radius, or around it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the Incisors what is between all the cavities from the bone: and make it thinner than you can on it at the end of lightness, as we have said, until you remove the bone, or with your hand, or with any other instrument that you have prepared for it: such as scalpel, and fine forkes.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary, so that you do not cause any accident, for the Terrible or the Incisor to touch anything of the skin.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have thus circled the bone by piercing it, and separated it from the skin, if it is continuous with it, and you extract it, you should saw off, and make equal the end of it which remains in the bone with another similar Incisory instrument.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it is thin and subtle rather than with other Incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	That if there remains anything of the bones small, and fragile: then take it with ease, along with what is with you from the instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with liniments, and unguents which we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another mode of the operation is simple, absolutely far from fear: which Galen said, and praised it greatly: and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary that you, first of all, begin to remove the bone from the place where the fracture is more severe and obvious: until such time as you have removed that part, and placed under it this lens-shaped incisor, whose shape this is.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part, nothing is injured by it: and the acute part of it on its sides running in length, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part may be placed at the syphac, with the acute side incident to the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike over the incisor from one side with a small mallet, until you strike all the bone with ease, as it revolves: and you are safe from the paniculum, which does not happen to it, which you fear most certainly.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the healer is not more foolish than men, and more ignorant of it, and is not asleep, then if anything was left attached to the bone from the paniculum in some places, he would strike himself with the extreme end of the lens-shaped incisor, and release himself from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For he is released from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the paniculum, and that which is severed from the bone is its shape, and there remain in it sharp and subtle roughness: then you should scrape off that roughness, and cut off those subtleties with fine razors which you have prepared for various quantities, so that it may be possible for you to administer them at all convenient times, and straightened out of them, according to the fact that the operation leads you to, and the bone fractured, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your proportion, first of all, a nail which is wider than those razors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after it the thinner one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you have reached the point of administering the thinnest, and the finer of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every remaining fissure of the lung, and in a subtle fracture, you should administer care according to what leads to its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And this is a thing that is not hidden over all, to which in this art there is any kind of study, and stood on what we have written, and showed in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if a patch is caught, when you remove the bone: then you should take a piece of linen cloth, according to the quantity of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and put it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of cloth, doubled or tripled, immerse it in wine and rose oil, and put it over the first cloth: and make it so that you can do it more easily over it, so that it does not hurt the wound.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer over it a broad ligament: and do not tighten it unless by the quantity that holds the bone alone: and leave it with this cure for one day or two days, until you are safe from scorching heat.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and administer after it medicines with which there is no need of dryness: such as the roots of the lily, and the flour of herbs, and the powder of thistle, and aristolochia, and similar ones: and it is so that you should make a powder of these medicines, which is powdered over the bone like those that are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And administer universally in it all medicine of the property by which it cleanses and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care, according to your skill, that the bone is in your cure clear: and it is not in it an oil of ointment, nor any kind of dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not leave a scar on it at all: for when the scar is placed on the linen cloth of the brain, it corrupts and spoils itself, and causes great mischief after it: and it has already happened to the scalp of the head, when it is cleaned from it by neglect of its care, blackening on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider then, if these accidents happen to the sick, that they are certainly lethal.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if the black color does not occur, except because of the medicine that is put on it, and this medicine has the virtue of making it black: then you must take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and with them a piece of linen cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put the piece on the syringe: then care for the piece with the curing species that are appropriate, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Of restoring the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the two upper parts of the nose do not break at the same time, or one of them: for they are two bones; because the lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break, and does not happen to it except by friction, and twists, and turns.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts of his nose breaks, then you must insert your little finger into the nostril hole and fix it with your index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And be careful so that you don't cause him any pain during your operation on him.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	That if the break is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that little finger: then it is necessary to even out the edge on which the little finger rests.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If, however, the break is in two parts, then make it similar: and hurry with its restoration on the first day of the break, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven or ten days from the time of the accident, when you are free from fever.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the nose's edge a piece of linen cloth if the break is in one part: or insert two pieces if the break is in two parts: and let it be of such a length that it fills the nostril hole.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the restorers of old times said, let licinia be filled with butter, and be exchanged every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That is not true, however, I think that it should be filled with alumen mixed with powder for grinding.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then let go of the licinia until the os firm, and the cartilage dries.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when it is inserted into the nose instead of licinia a goose feather after it has been wrapped with a soft cloth: and so it is, that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and does not prevent the sick from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you want, make it so: and if you want, make licinia.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	That if it should happen to the nose while you are operating an apoplexy of warm wax, a nasum plastered with cerite, or with a little oil infused with rosemary, or with a little dyaquillon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if an apoplexy of warm wax does not occur, then let the plaster itself be made with siamese flour, and the powder of dried thistle mixed with alumen.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a piece of lint on top, and do not bind the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the bones of the nose are broken or crushed, then you should split them and remove the pieces with the appropriate instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then carry out the incision, and care for the nose when it becomes inflamed, and consolidated with the appropriate plasters or ointment.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	That if a nail should get caught between the nose, then you should take care of the nose with licinia: and administer a lead tube, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Of the restoration of the lower jaw when broken.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and the fracture is not with the nail: then consider if it is a single fracture, and not broken into two parts, and care for the interior: then the knowledge of it is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	If there is a fracture on the right side of his body, then you should insert the left index finger into the wound: if there is a fracture in the left mandible, then you should insert the right index finger; and push it with ease from the inside towards the outside with your other hand, moving it equal to the fracture.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the mandible has already separated into two pieces, then you should handle the extraction of the two parts according to their straightness: until it is possible to restore equality to it.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If an injury or fracture has already occurred to the teeth, and they have been moved from their place, then you should tighten them together with the hope that they will remain with gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then put on top of the fractured mandible a poultice.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over it a double cloth, and place over the cloth a large wooden splint that has been made equal in length to the mandible; or a piece of skin cut to size, equaling the length of the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it from above, according to how you have prepared the ligature for yourself, and let the application remain as it is until it has healed; and order the patient to use calmness and silence; and provide him with soft food to eat.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you think that something has changed in its appearance in some way: then approach and undo it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten out what has been moved from it, and cover the mandible with flour that has been sifted, mixed with egg white or wheat flour, after you have removed the poultice; and place a layer of soft wool over the covering.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While the attached poultice remains on the mandible and its disposition of bones does not change, then release it, do not undo it, until it has healed: or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often tightened seven times.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, a hot swelling occurs in the meantime, then administer to it what we have said many times regarding sedating it, until it disappears.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if there is a fracture with the radius, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	I have already separated the fragment of bone, or from the satlage; then carefully in this place, so that you remove those satages with it when you need to take away them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If, however, the opening of the wound is tight, then increase it with the phlebotome according to the quantity of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you remove those satages, and there remains none of them, then close the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, put on top of it plaster that suits it, and let it heal until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	The restoration of the Fork, when it breaks.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI:
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Many things break from the front part of the shoulder, and the fracture of the fork is made in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it breaks and separates into two, except that they happen to be in it satages: and it is easier to restore its.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or thus, so that they happen on the bone of satage: and it is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or so, so that there is a fracture with the radius.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in it when there is a fracture without radius, is, as you make present these two ministers, that one of them holds the help that follows the broken fork, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then you should equalize your fingers' fractures, until it is shaped according to what needs to be done: and there should not be any eminence in it, or closed.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you can tolerate an extension further, then it is necessary that you put under a cotton ball or woolen sphere: and let the magnitude of it be according to your need: and let it extend, and close the fork, and grasp the sphere with your hand, until you equalize the fracture, according to what needs to be done.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you can't get to the end of the fork towards the outside: for this reason, because it reaches the depth: then it is necessary that you lie down on your back on a tray: and put under his shoulder a medium-sized pillow in its magnitude, and press the minister of his shoulder to the lower side, until it lifts up the bone of the fork that is at the depth towards the top: and then you should straighten out the fracture, and equalize it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If, however, you feel a pulse in the furcula, and it is pulsatile: then you should, with ease, find upon it, and extract the pulse.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If, however, it is retained in the bone, then you should use one of the incisorii which you prepared for that purpose after you had placed under the furcula the siffach-holder: and the holder is made either of wood or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is attached to the ear which has not been incised.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its length should be according to that at which you are accustomed, by reason of the size of the bone and its proportion.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	The length, however, should also be according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And let it have two ends, as you see: and one end let it be wide, and the other end let it be narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the wound which you made while extracting the pulse from the bone is wide, and if it is secure from the dry heat: then you should join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the wound is small, or if you have no difficulty in keeping the dry heat away: then you should fill the wound with rags, and with powder according to the size of the wound which has been cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If, however, the dry heat should occur: then you should pour on the cloth in rosewater, and vinegar, and wine, and put it on the top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The stricture of the bone, however, when it is free from wound and from section, is, that you should place on the bone a paste made of crushed flour with aloes.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And put on a wooden plank above it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then you should place a ball under the tip of the bone, if you can bear that: and then you should raise the foot with the help of a block.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then you should take up the blood, that is, the roller which the Saracens hold, which is long and wide: and its length should be that of a palm, or about it.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled pad over the stump and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a small tray, whose length is three fingers wide and whose width is also three fingers wide.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth and tray together at the edge of the wound where the healing begins, over the broken area and place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the healing over the fracture like a bandage, and wrap it around his neck, and under the chin, healthy and sick, and bring it back to all parts, and as you see that the pressure holds the fracture together: and this is what does not cover you up, and all, so that it does not rub against the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this, you should see the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever you see that the ligaments have loosened, then straighten out the bandage, and tighten up the ligaments.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place a soft mattress on his back, and under the chin of the person lying down on it, so that when he moves, he feels relief from the side of his neck; and place a thin pillow behind him in bed at night, so that he feels support for his neck from behind.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Then the fracture will heal with arm movement.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to the neck: and do not break the ligaments, unless there is an accident from itching or hanging by the neck for twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then patch up the bandage again if you see that he is going back to the wound.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add pressure, and let him go, until it has healed and clotted.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture will heal and strengthen over a period of twenty days; and sometimes it takes longer in some people to heal this.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	## Of restoring a broken Spatul
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	It is rare for a spatula to break, and not if it breaks in the middle of its width: and it will not break from the edge of it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore the fracture is broken out of it, and broken in the middle of it, and is not known but by feeling: then according to what is the form of the fracture prepare its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce her to the natural form in every way possible with your skill, which is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on the place of the wound with a powdery substance with chalk and wood spice, and put on top of it a cloth towel.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on over the body a thin wooden plate from a thin board according to the amount of the spoon of all, or larger it a little.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If however under the plate is broken into some places of the spoon, then make it equal with soft spice until the plate descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then rub over it with long-lasting, tightening as it is applied, and the strength of the plate, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever you loosen the bandage, tighten it again, and make the plate equal if it moves away from its place: and let the sick lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spoon is restored after twenty days, or after thirty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number has been completed, then you shall loosen the bandage: and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For that is from the bones, of which communion there is no fear, nor is their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however it proceeds from a bone-fragment, and pierces under the skin: then cut over it, and take it away.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what I said in the fracture of the fork from sitting with the hot poultice, if anything comes from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Of the restoration of the fracture of the chest.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and that rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities however most frequently break, and are destroyed by the accidents of it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When his middle is broken and it inclines towards the lower parts, and he feels a great pain, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and perhaps he vomits blood, and there appears to be fracture of the bone, and it does not remain hidden from sensation, then his recovery is that he should lie down on his back: and place between his palms.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and join the ribs from both sides with the hands: and gently adjust his alignment, in whatever way is possible for him to be so adjusted, until his ribcage regains its shape, according to what is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place over him an embrocation and a cushion, and place under him a board made of thin boards from willow or linden, or similar, in lightness, after you have spread it out with cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then gently adjust the binding over the broken bone so that it does not move: and sometimes with the binding turn him around according to the roundness towards his back, and tighten him by tightening him.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the binding every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it: and if need be to bring about its healing when there is itching, or a sore spot, or pain, or swelling: then apply, and unravel it, and remove the embrocation, and adjust whatever has happened with the course of treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then remove the embrocation if you see towards it: and attach the binding, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	The restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that the fracture of ribs does not occur, except in the places near the back, and from the outer ends towards the front.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them any grinding, except therefore, because they are cartilage-like.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of this does not remain hidden from sensation during inquiry with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And his restoration is so that a broken rib with the fingers in any way that is possible for him to be so adjusted, until its shape is even, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then bind the plaster, and tightly tie the broken bone with a cable, if it is not enough.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	If the fracture is of the ribs and goes into the interior: then it happens to the sick person a great pain, and also a piercing, such as that which happened to him who has pleurisy: for the rib stings the wound, and also it happens to him difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and much spitting of blood: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancient ones have already devised it with many contrivances: and from them are those who say, that you put on food which generates inflammation and ventosity, so that it inflames the abdomen, and is extended, and drives the fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we shun, so that there is no need to make a quick poultice hot, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If it has already happened, then add this to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: Let it be placed on a damp place, and then suck it with determination, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, they are afraid that the moisture attracts fluctuations to the place, because of the weakness of disposition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: It is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been immersed in hot oil: and let there be placed fluffy things between the ribs, until it is filled: so that the bandage is equal when it is wrapped up according to the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person will be cured with a diet and medicine which cures pleurisy.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	That if the rib breaks the sick person's wound, which he does not bear, and stings the wound with the cable, and we fear for the sick: then let us break it on the place, and let us find the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us put on it an instrument which preserves the scent, of which the memory precedes: and let us cut the bone easily, and let us cut the bone itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us gather together two lips of the wound if it is large with stitches; and let us cure it with plasters until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If, however, between them there is a hot swelling, then let it be covered, and pour powder in rose oil and place it over the place; and let the sick person be treated with it as long as is necessary for the poultice.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Then also he should lie on his side, on a mattress, until he gets well.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	For the restoration of a broken spine of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Of the bones of the neck when a fracture occurs, and this rarely happens to them by abrasion: also of the spine of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When, therefore, it has happened to anyone and you want to know whether it is healed or not, then trust it.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and stupefied, and dead: and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor tighten them with your fingers, and when you prick them with a needle, he feels no pain, and does not feel the pain in them: then know that he is not healed, and is deathly in many respects.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If he feels movement in them and feels the tension with your fingers and the prick: then know that the spine of the neck is healed, and that the sick person will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If there is a similar thing in his spine of the back, and you want to know whether it is healed or not, then look at his feet: if you see that they are already softened, and what has happened in his hands also happens in them: then when he lies on his back, he walks with a limp and without volition; and when he rises on his stomach, he walks without volition: and when he rises again on his back, and wants to drink, but cannot: then know that it is deadly.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Non ergo labores in curatione eius.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing happens to him from that, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure of him that happens from that is, as you seek to calm an inflammation of hot blisters: so, as you put on oil of rose alone: or when you go out, as you wash yourself.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place on that for some times in the day until it is calmed down: then place on a place of plasters that comfort and dry up and bind well to it with bandage: and order the sick person to use rest and tranquillity.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the side where he feels pain until it heals.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If indeed there happens a separation of the bone with a blister, or something that has already been separated from it: then let it be separate on the skin, and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bind together two lips of the wound if it is large, with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the person with some ointment, from balm, until he heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the end of a bone is broken and the tail is cut off: then let it be that the thumb of the left hand enters into the wound, and the other hand fixes the broken bone as well as possible, according to the second principle of correction.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place on it, and remove it: and take care of the wound with the cure that preceded, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	§ On the restoration of the anchae.
Caput XI.	On the treatment of the head.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely do the bones of the skull fracture.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then their break is not, unless it is a crack at the ends of them: and they split along their length, and turn inwardly: and there happens a sore pain in the place where it is broken, and a bruise: and the foot that is broken turns black.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of that is, as you stretch your hand over it, until you stand on the break, as is the figure of it.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is in its extremities only, then make that fracture equal, according to how it is prepared for you from equality, until such time as it takes on a natural shape of its own.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is in length, or already leans towards the inside: then let the sick one lie on his belly, until such time as that fracture is prepared for you by restoration.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have made that equal, then place a plaster on it: and then place on it a frame of wood, or of skin: and tightly bind with strapping, so as not to fear the shifting of the fracture, nor the removal of the frame.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equal concavity of those with it, so that it fills it, until such time as it takes it by equality: and direct the sick one, so that he sleeps on his back, or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if there happens to be a swelling of heat on him: then cease from extending it, and from its restoration, until such time as the swelling of heat has settled down: and place over him that sits, according to what preceded, and then return to its restoration: and tightly bind him as is right.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if it has happened in the bone, or is broken, remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	The Helper for Restoration of a Fracture
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The Helper is that which is between the hip bone and the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	But if it is broken, then its restoration is according to two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	Of which one is: that you should take a flat piece of wood of middle thickness, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And bind with two straps on both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then let it hang from a raised place: and the sick one should sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then let him throw his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches to the tip of his elbow, at which point is annexed the width of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend something heavy from above it so that the doctor can reach below.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor should break the bones of his own hands at the same time, until he heals, according to what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that the sick person should lie on his back on a pillow: and his hand be suspended from his neck with a strap.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then order two servants, so that one of them holds what is above the fracture with his hands: and the other one holds his lower parts, and each one extends to his side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you want the extension to be stronger, then tie something under the fracture with a strap, and above it with another strap: and each of the two servants should extend to his side.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the end of the arm, then it is necessary that one strap be placed under the joint, and another under the fracture in relation to the shoulder.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And likewise if the fracture is near the hip: then it is necessary that a strap be placed on that spot, and on the hip itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then make the fracture heal easily without effort, until it is healed in the way that is necessary, and applied with a good application: then tie it up, if there is no swelling of the hot kind.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if a swelling of the hot kind does occur, then do not tie it up until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on the body a woolen cloth soaked in vinegar and olive oil, until it stops when the swelling quiets down: then tie it up: and the method of tying it up is that you place a patch over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place an innovation made from new cloth on top of the patch.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then the doctor should put his arm on a support, and place his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and tie it over the support of the arm, so that the arm stays in place with the help of the supports: unless you are forbidden to touch him, or if he moves around you or anything else made from broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If time permits and a bone breaks above you, then use stars: and it is, as you place upon the break itself a star which is wider and stronger than the others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And you should place between all the stars the length of a finger: and its length should be according to the break with the addition of three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten over the stars with the tension that I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, so that your tension over the place of the break is tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the break lengthens, the looser should be the tension.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If then you see the stars' distance and tension, like we said, at the moment when you restore the limb immediately, then do it: and if you have time for a poultice warm, then dismiss tension and stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for three days, so that there does not occur in the place itchiness, or swelling, or to prevent food from reaching the limb, due to the tension's excess.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	So straighten out all of this, according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you have confidence, that nothing will occur from it: then do not loosen the ligaments, unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let him sleep on his back, and his hands on his stomach: and let you place under the pillow a full blanket evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day, so that the broken limb does not loosen, or become weak the ligaments.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	So straighten out all of this with your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food for the nurse according to the order that we set forth, so that it is a light meal in the beginning, until he begins to tighten his jaw: and then it should grow heavier.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the custom of support and splint is, so that it is tightened for forty days: so then it should be loosened, and a bath is given to it, and treated with a ointment that corrects it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul and bruised, then do not disassemble it from its ligaments and sprains for fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII. On the Restoration.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two femurs.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small: and that is what follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and that which is placed below on the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore does the larger bone alone break, or the smaller one: and perhaps both break at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the small bone breaks above, then is its restoration easy, and its recovery easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the smaller bone breaks below, it is a bad fracture, and its recovery difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse is it when both bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore is the bone that breaks slightly above, then it behooves the physician to take care in its restoration, that he may put an extension on the small one with ease, until it is equal.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if the larger bone is the one that breaks: then should he put a stronger extension on with zeal.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it behooves him to put the shape of the hand in its restoration, and an extended extension above the wrist.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher on all the fingers: and let the flexor muscle be present on all the fingers, or else missing: and let it sit quadrangular before itself, or in front of it, or to its left, or to its right, so that it does not incur pain while sitting.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then he should extend the arm from its lower part, or from his own hand, or with a ligament.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another minister should extend from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should even out the bone, until he can reduce it to the best shape that he can obtain.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are any knots in the fracture of the bone, then you should strive to reduce each projeniture in its own place by your own virtue.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed it appears that there is a separate satuma in it, and you pierce the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then remove it according to the manner which we have said in those preceding words.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	But if the fracture is with the ulna, I have already done to that chapter a singular thing, so take the cure of it there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	That if it should happen in the beginning of your restoration to have a hot swelling, then make a panel of thin cloth with a yellow color from oiled oil, and white, and put between its thickness and thinness: and tighten the panel on him with a strict but gentle string, until when he settles down the swelling: then remove the panel, and place a prepared patch made from ground dust with albumen.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on patches, and let the patch that is put on the fracture be a little wider, and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know, that the number of patches for the arm is six in several dispositions: whether it is a fracture in one finger, or in two fingers together.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then put on your bandage in a stronger and more durable place, and slightly more with the bandage of its fracture: or put on a softer bandage according to what preceded its memory in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloth wrapped around the fracture, soft, damp cloth: and not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread with which it is tightened from linen itself, between thinness and thickness, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and ligaments after a few days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	That if anything should happen for which correction is necessary, such as itching that occurs in the limb: then let it be, to immerse the limb with hot water, until that itch subsides, and remove the bandage not constricted, until it is calm, and then repeat the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	That if the bandage has already become softened, and the bone is already removed, and similar things: then restore it completely with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	If nourishment is forbidden from reaching the limb because of the excess of the scar tissue, then it should be left for a little while and then tightened afterwards.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, nothing of what we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary that he should be healed unless after twenty days or so.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the patient's hand should be suspended from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And his neck should be kept level and guarded from sudden movements by a strong bandage.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And let him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in twenty or thirty days; and perhaps it will be restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this depends on the condition of the skin and the strength of the healing power.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	[On the Restoration of Fractures of the Hand].
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XXII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that it is rare for a fracture to occur in the hand or in the knuckles of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And does not happen to him unless there is repeated bruising.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When, however, the fracture or bruising occurs while sitting, then let the sick person sit in a square shape, and let there be a second seat opposite to it for a witness.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then put his hand on top of it.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the surgeon should make the broken bones join together by means of a proper bandage, until they are joined together well.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that a plaster and a support be placed there, unless a feverish swelling occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the plaster from above by the quantity of the place: and you have already covered it with linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If, however, the fracture is toward the lower part of the hand near the wrist, then make a sort of a ball from cloth: and instruct the sick person to wrap his hand with it so that it will be bent like a ball; and then tie it tightly with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the plaster be made of liniment that is soft, so that it may be applied to the body with the skin; and tie it tightly, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If, however, the fracture is external, then it should be: you should place a staff above, and another staff below the foot: and hold the hand open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put the splint on, as the hand is extended: and extend it between the fingers with a bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If, however, the fracture affects any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be treated according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it up with the foot: and if the patient has a preference, then put a staff that is straight and firm: so that the fracture may be kept immobile, and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If, however, the fracture affects any of the other digits, such as the middle, index, or ring finger, then it should be treated by joining it with the next healthy digit: or by tying them all together according to their continuity: and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a staff above it, as we have said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after that disposition aposteme of heat: and oppose with it whatever is necessary, when anything happens from it, according to what it returns of his narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Pelvis.
Caput XV.	CHAPTER XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The pelvis often breaks, and it is declared to the sense: because it turns towards the inner and back parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration was made so that it is tightened by ligaments above the fracture, and a ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the injured person extends his hand over his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he extends all the ligaments to the side according to equality: and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If, however, there is a fracture near the root of the pelvis, then put the ligament on the side facing towards the pelvis so that it extends upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And in the same way if there is a fracture near the knee, then put the ligament close to the knee so that it extends towards the bottom: and another ligament above the fracture.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor makes the two hands of the patient even, until he reduces it according to its natural shape: and the bones are joined together with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then let it be placed with plaster and tightened if there is no swelling of the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	That if there is a swelling on it: then let him rest for a few days, until the swelling goes down, and then return to your cure.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The tightening should be like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap the bone with a hard cloth, that is, leather: and make it twice as long, or three times: and let there be an excess of it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until it reaches the heel bone.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And put a long thread between the pelvis and the leg near the knee from below, and make its ends come out of the two sides from the upper part.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap the crus and pelvis with a surplus of leather.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put two stars above the pelvis where the fracture is: and place one star on top of the leg bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill with linen swabs between the leg and pelvis where the ligaments are to be placed, so that it is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong constriction from the middle over the site of the fracture into three or four evolutions.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And to the extent that you extend it with a ligament from the site of the fracture, your constriction will be less tight and softer, and milder.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then introduce between the hip and the thigh.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Bind then with three threads that are from above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then introduce the two ends of the thread into the lower part, until you reach the ankle bone.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when you tighten each end of the thread and also the ends of the strands from the other side: so that the ligament does not move away from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then remove the constriction over that while it remains, so that no member corruption occurs, nor swelling, nor inflammation, and such like.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything of that happens.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Then apply the solution to it and make straight what has happened there completely, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if a fragment from the bone prickles: then it should be made even, if it is possible for you to do so.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find over that and move it: and take care with the memory of its predecessor until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture in the hip is constricted, apart from adding strands to it as we have said in the lower leg and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, when repairing this fracture in such a way that no limp or pain occurs.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is repaired alone, apart from having the other leg applied to it, then that person will always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you should know that the hip is constricted in fifty days, or a little added, or a little stretched: all of this is according to difference of color, and the condition of the others.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Regarding the repair of a fracture in the knuckle of the knee.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that a fracture in the knuckle of the knee is rare, but it occurs to it often by wear and tear.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If, however, a fracture has occurred, then only a fracture, or a notch, or an opening in his parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And that is when the ulna is broken, and without the ulna.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And he will stand completely on that with his sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of him is such that it equals what is broken out of his parts with fingers, until it coalesces, and joins together according to what is possible from equality and convenience, and manufacture.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put plaster from flour, or grinding, with albumen, and put on top of it a round paddle, if you can endure that: and tighten the tightness corresponding to it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions that we have spoken of in the remaining fractures: such as the swelling of heat, and their likes: so that you oppose every accident with him that is suitable to him, until he heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a leg fracture
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII On the head
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You should know that there are two bones in the leg, one is large and is called the femur bone: and the other is slender, and is called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it has happened to both of the types of leg fracture that happens to the two bones of the arm: and because of that its restoration is made like the restoration of the arm in equality, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	That if both bones break together, the leg becomes bent in all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the slender bone breaks, the leg bends forward.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the large bone breaks, it inclines downwardly: and is one of those which do not hide themselves from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, equality, and binding of the joints according to that which is equal.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the leg fracture is a bad fracture, having many complications: let it be that there is less extension, and milder relief to you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg there is also an operation similar to that of the arm: and it is, when you equalize the joints, and perform all your operation, then take two strips of pine wood, which is used in making shoulder blades that are placed under tables: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose from them those that have little thickness, and there are none from the small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then he sewed together two pieces of cloth with two sutures according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one end of the leg at one side and the other end at the other side: and they should come together from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then he sewed together two layers at three places from the ends and middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when there is a tightening, the leg leans to the right and left, and it stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now he will prepare the splint of wood according to the length of the leg and place the leg in it so that it may be preserved from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed you must do this very much when you have a fracture, when it has broken on its own.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day and make careful examination to check for any swelling or other problems.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If then anything happens from these things, then oppose it with him as is necessary until he is healed, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	For the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel does not have a deep fracture.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, when there is a fracture of the bones of the foot and also of the toes, and when there is little or no fracture to them, they only experience damage in many situations.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	What if there is a fracture of the bones of the foot and you see those bones sliding away from each other on top, then place the injured foot on the ground as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you up and place your foot on that which raises it from those bones, then press or step on it, and make it even, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then put on a splint, and support from above: and place under the ankle a flat board with two ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tighten it with the leg as you lower it, after you have wrapped it up with rags and the rest with which it needs to be wrapped.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	After three days or four have passed, then solve the ligaments.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you shall not recognize the bones that are equal, nor shall you know if they are fractured, or if they are dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation on these is the same as for those.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if some of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and equal the rest according to what I have told you in the restoration of finger-joints of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then put your finger on a ruler according to the length of the finger, and make it a little wider: then place this table under the foot as I have told you, and tighten it with a tight fastening.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if what is broken is two or three or more bones, then place over each finger a staff of its own length, wrapped in a cloth: and tighten the table in the lower foot: and let it stand on one corner of the table outside the navel of the foot, so that it holds by good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it should be for you, so that you do not forget, to consider all that I have told you about the other broken bones from the accidents which we have mentioned: and oppose every accident with him that it may be needed.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	As for the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the bones of the chest, and the penis of a man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is broken, then let her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her towards the back side of herself, and hold her in place.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then fill the vulva of the woman with cotton, until it is filled: and let it be shaped in the vulva like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then stir the woman up, and gently spread her back.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cotton will come out, until it is before the door of the vulva like a sphere, and the broken opening will return.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a small ball on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	But when she wants to urinate, let the cotton come out easily, and then let her urinate: and bring it back to its place, as you put it in first: and then let her return to her ball first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let it be seven days, or about that, because the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you want, take a scimitar, and tightly insert a twig of fern through its hole, and introduce the entire wound into his Vuluam.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the twig with force, until the wound bends inside the Vuluam; for it returns broken.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it with poultice, and let it stand for a few days, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the Pectis bone breaks due to a man's or woman's strength, then administer to its restoration, and that which we have said concerning the anchoring of it into the bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And a straight bone does not hide in those who are next to it, which happens little, especially if it is someone who has some study, or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for the fracture itself signifies to you many things about the right way to restore its own strictness: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when the man' s bone breaks, take the throat of a goose; and introduce the entire arm into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place over it a healing cloth, and heal it, and let it stand for three days, or about that, and it will be healed, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	For the restoration of broken bones, when it is with the arm.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It belongs to him who has suffered a fracture with an injury, especially if it is a large bone, such as the hip, or auxiliaries, or similar to it, as you please, and stop the bleeding immediately: if you are able to control the conditions of bloodletting, as we have mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound spurts blood, then you should, as you please, aim at cutting off its supply so that it turns into dust on the bone: if you do not have anything else present.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to repair the fracture on that very day; and do not delay it, unless an apostema occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If, however, an apostema occurs, then put off the restoration until the ninth day, until it has subsided.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third day and on the fourth at all, for you will make bad accidents happen to it.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If, however, the broken bone is prominent above the detected wound: then it should be necessary for you to reduce it, and make it even with your hands easily and with a small extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, the extension is not prepared, and its equalling with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And that instrument is made of iron, the length of which is the quantity of seven or eight fingers; and its width according to the amount of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this reason it is necessary for the doctor to take three or four of them according to the amount that he needs for healing of any type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be a little thickness in it so that it does not split when pressed upon the wound during the operation: and let its ends be acute, having a margin in its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be above in thickness from half of it to the bottom.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, the acute end of the instrument should be placed over the prominent end of the bone: and push it with a single force until, when the bone has been reduced, it is even with a certain equaling.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	So keep in mind to make the ends of the fracture even with each other face-to-face.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If, however, the ends of the fracture are thin, and the instrument cannot take hold of them well: then it should be necessary for you to knock the end of the bone so that the instrument can have a grip on it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If, however, you cannot reduce them with the instrument I have described at all, then strike it with one of the incisers that we mentioned: or saw it with a saw in any way possible for you to do.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then cut off what remains in the bone from roughness and small cortex.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone is thus reduced, and remains after its reduction a great pain sore lamed, then know that the bone has not returned to its own place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do therefore this also.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For thou hast a great help in the infirmity, when thou hast completed thy restoration which thou doest to the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then dip the cloth in black sour wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not put on any woolen cloth, nor anything in which there be oil; lest that it should come to pass in it that the putrefaction and corruption should take place.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the herbs in the hour of your complentation from the restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And discharge the cloth laid on: so that you may fall with the hooks into the openings second by second in quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take all care, lest thou shouldest draw the bone with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times have done this foolish physicians: and it has come to pass in their infirmities or death or corruption or putrefaction, that is, rot.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And may your constriction be soft, gentle, diverse from the constriction of broken fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	That if the bone is ill, or is a great bone, and be patient on the top of it such an evil thing which we have described, and in which pain hangs out in place: then it should not be put on the top of the bone herbs.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them openings from hard cloths at the place of herbs, and draw the bone with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When it is after a day, or days two, and you see the bone begin to come on, as if there were pus generated therein: then take off from above the bone the cloth which thou hast put on above the bone with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer leech-blood, and ointments with which we are wont to treat wounds, as the four-drug ointment, and similar things.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it befits thee to loose the ligature.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening until it heals over, and is healed up.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way, that the pus go out of it from below with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	That if there pass many days without the wound being healed over, and pus does not come away from it: then know that there are little bones in it.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why you should enquire about the wound when it is hurting.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those little bones are separated, remove them and pull them out yourself.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And which of those little bones are not separated, and stab the limb, and cause pain to it, prevent that from happening to it, and remove it by any means possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	That if an injury to the limb occurs, or swells up, that is, gangrene, or some other kind of corruption and putrefaction: then you should turn each one of those little bones away from it as far as possible, by using what precedes it in the treatment, whose account was given in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from that in which it is necessary that my speech should remain, and to which you should pay attention when a bone breaks, and comes out on top of the limb, such as the hip bone, and similar ones from the large limbs, namely, that you do not assume attraction from it, for many times death occurs from it, except that you let it go until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps, however, it falls away of its own accord after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore be careful about the wound if you have it, otherwise let it go.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of a fracture in a broken limb.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This is often the case with the treatment of a fracture in a broken limb.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, that which is near joints: and it is fed from that figure of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps he may restrain the member from his own operation by nature.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider therefore at that time, if the swelling is recent: administer to her medicines which have a constricting action, such as aloe, and olive oil, and myrrh, and siccity-collyrims, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So, that you should take some of these things, or all of them: and bind them with a stingy liquor, or with an albumen-vial, or with vinegar: and place them on the swelling in a poultice, and tighten them over the good constriction.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And release the constriction, do not break it off after many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then remove it, and again apply another one until the swelling disappears.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tighten over it a leaden plate askew.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead is a property to remove all that we fear from the member.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the swelling has already become hard and constricted, and there is a need to remove it quickly: then find on top of it, and strike off the surplus: or cut it with some scissors, until it comes off: and take care of it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Of the cure when it is restored, and remains a member after that, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapt. XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of the bone is restored, and remains a member after that, feeble: then it is not made because of many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is, a multitude of the solution of the ligament and its not being according to what should be done: or because of the excess of the constriction of the ligaments, until it is restrained from running into the member: or because of a multitude of emollients in an inappropriate time: or because of a lack of blood in the body, and weakness of it.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And its cure is, to feed the sick, and to make the member strong: until there is an increase of blood in it.
Et administra balneum.	And apply the balm.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place the scalpel on the member: so that the scalpel draws toward it a great deal of his nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And make him rub with emollient ointment and warm water until he has returned to his natural form, and then put on a clean bandage.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	In the cure for broken bones when they are healing in a twisted position.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it has happened that a member has been restored after its sanation and eminence of the bone fracture, or tremor: and the nourishment is fed through it in the form of the member, however, the member is not prevented from its natural operation: then you should not hear his complaint that he wants to break the member again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have been many stammerers of doctors and restaurators who made this in our country.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	This operation is indeed a great one, leading to death, or great fear, as if it were mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the limpness and trembling are recent: then it should be rubbed with warm water in which have been steeped softening herbs such as leaves of althaea, and its root, and mealoza, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make him a ointment with a softening ointment, like the diochine made from dandelion roots.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or be applied mucus of althaea root, and mixed with chicken fat, or oil of sesame: and rubbed with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take oak leaves, and dry them with ash wood, and similar things that are called medicines which reduce the consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the trembling has been removed by persistent friction, old, and soft, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And administer movement of the member to all parts in all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the twistedness has already preceded, and is strong, and has become hard like a stone, and there is a need to cure it with iron: then let the upper part be cut off, and the continuation of the bone be healed, and what is in excess of the twist be removed with very fine incisions: and administer ease to him with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On the Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter on the dislocation of the head.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of a joint from its normal position.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Why does it obstruct its own motion, and distort the form of the limb?
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And causes pain on an already weak part, and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	So when a dislocation occurs, one should immediately seek to restore it: nor should he delay at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if delayed, the joint will stiffen up, and there may be reduction of the dislocation with it.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, in order not to make him move, nor to extend him in the hour of his stiffening,
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes a spasm and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then you should, in order to prepare for the bleeding.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be put away until it is calm.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member is anointed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then reduce it with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And take care of each member, bringing it back to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, also according to what preceded it in fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Chapter on the treatment of a dislocated mandible.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25: On the Treatment of a Dislocated
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two mandibles rarely dislocate.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the upper and lower jaws occurs in two different ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are removed from their places with a slight distance, and become slightly softer.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they dislocate completely and firmly, until they become softer towards the chest, until they flow with saliva, and cannot hold it, nor can they close their mouth, and wrap their tongue around the spoon with a sigh.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however its dislocation is slight, then it returns of itself with some difficulty.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If it is indeed a complete dislocation, then it is whole: then one should give the reduction to him quickly, and not wait long: and it is so that the nurse holds his head: and the doctor inserts his thumb of his hand on one side into the root of the dislocation between the jaw and the mouth if the dislocation is from one part.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he inserts two thumbs at the same time, if the dislocation is from two parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the other fingers of his hand are outside, which he equalizes.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And tell the sick person to clean his jaws and eat with all his teeth.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor equalizes the jaw and pushes it back into place until he gets back to his own place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	That if it is difficult to reduce him, especially if both jaws are together: then give a steam with hot water and oil until the reduction becomes easy: and do not delay reducing the jaws at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they are closed and equalized, and the nurse's mouth does not open: then place over them some woolen cloths, with a sponge that is made of wax: and oil-laced.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then tie it together easily with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the nurse lie on his back: and let his head be between two cloth pieces so that he does not turn to one side or the other: nor does he fidget or try to chew anything: but a soft food is given to him to eat, until such time as he can open his mouth easily, and his jaw is made to move: then he eats what he wants, and it is given to him with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not labor over the opening of his mouth when eating and drinking, or talking, until such time as his jaw is made to move and heal.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	That if it is difficult to reduce the two jaws when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their own place: then many times fever and sour water come from there: and perhaps a sick stomach comes forth, and perhaps pure choler comes out.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	For this reason you see that it is a loss, and often he dies who has this thing happen to him in ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the Reduction of a Dislocation of the Furcula and Extremity of the Humerus.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26: On the Reduction of a Disl
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furcula does not dislocate from the inside due to its continuation with the chest wall.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it dislocates sometimes to the outside, and this is made known by a sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is so that he lies sick on his back, and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then tie the place with your palm by a strong tie, for it will be reduced again.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a plaister on it, and pull it tight, and tie it up.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities that follow the bed, and continue with it, do not dislocate except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it dislocates on one day: then it should be reduced and made even as we have said, and it should be prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a plaister on it, and pull it tight, and tie it up tightly.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And order the sick person to adhere to rest and calmness until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same cure, the extremity of the Humerus is reduced when it separates from its place also.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the Reduction of a Dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27: On the Reduction of a Disl
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You should know that the Humerus does not dislocate unless by three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of which one is so that it dislocates to the tickling side toward the lower part.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is so that it dislocates to the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it dislocates upward on the extremity of the Humerus, and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not dislocate toward the rear, due to the shape of the shoulder blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not dislocate forward, due to the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And much more is dislocated and displaced to the lower side towards the tip: above all in those, whose flesh is scarce.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For it is quickly discharged from them, and quickly enters.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those, whose flesh is great, is contrary to it, that is to say, because it is discharged with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men that there is a blow, or a fall, and the humerus is dislocated cold, and it is thought because of that, since it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore let it be so, that you experience that thing, until you are sure of its certainty, and then proceed to cure it.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the dislocation is known when it is towards the lower side towards the tip: and you distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you manifestly see a difference between them, and if you touch the tip of the head of the humerus, it seems to be almost itself: and cannot the sick hand reduce to its socket, nor move it in all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And likewise, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards: then there is a manifest touch, and it is not concealed.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And of this kind of dislocation the reduction is easily made, when he is young, or a sick boy.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, as if he raises his own hand to his upper side.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your fingers under its tip, and raise the joint with strength towards the upper side to its place: and the minister will raise his hand, and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then put it down below, for himself he returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if he does not return through that which I have said, and there are many days from the time of dislocation: then let it be, that the sick man bathe in warm water, and an emollient lotion is given to him, which softens and relieves, such as if they had been boiled in oak leaves, and fennel seed, and meadow sweet in water, and given.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the sick person shall be placed on his back: and a ball and wool should be placed under him, which is equal to the length and narrowing.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor shall place his heel upon the ball, and raise with force the head of the humerus, and draw the hand of the nurse towards the lower part.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another attendant shall hold the head of the patient so that he does not move to the lower part: for he returns at once.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this mode: and it is so, that the longer sick person may stand present, and stand on the side, and introduce his shoulder under the ball of the attendant: and raise the ball of the attendant towards the upper part, until the sick person hangs suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another attendant shall hold the hand of the patient at the lower part of his thigh.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the sick person is light: then it should be so, that he be suspended with something else besides him, so that he does not return to his dislocation: for it returns at once.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another mode: and it is so, that he be placed on the ground a long round wooden figure, whose head is round: like the handle of the pestle: which is neither gross nor subtle.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then a sheet of soft cloth should be placed under the sick person, after it has been placed on the head of the wood: and the sick person should stand standing according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand shall be extended to the lower part from one side, and his body shall be extended from the other side with force: for the joint returns to its place with velocity.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	That if it is difficult to reduce him by all that we have said, then use this care: and it is so, that you take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: and its head round, that he may ease the entrance into the depths of his titillica, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are tied tightly around the head, so that the wood does not hurt the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then, under the chin, so that the hands can be extended, or the arm up to the bottom: and the wood is tied over the aid and the arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then, put the arm across the steps on the side, and extend the hand down, and let the rest of the body hang by the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For sure it should be joined immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	Since then, as soon as the entry is complete in whatever way possible: then it should be placed under the ball of equal size made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then put the prepared plaster made from ground flour with olive oil and egg white on the whole shoulder, as it turns away upwards.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten with a tight belt from below: and turn the ligaments over the plaster from above: and tie his hands to his neck, and let them go, and do not move his hands for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it should be that food for the sick is provided until the member is healed: for it is faster to heal it.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one is placed after seven or five days, and he exercises with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If then it stands firm and does not weaken, then it is healed now.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If then the joint dislocates many times, because of the moisture that occurs with it, or because of another cause: then it should be administered to it a caustic with three openings, as is described in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	That if this is done completely, and the ligaments are allowed to heal after seven days, and the joint does not firm up, and the plaster and tightening fall off a few times, and does not get stiff, and falls down, and he cannot raise it upwards: then you should know that the nerves in his shoulder have been cut, or extended, or weakened: and you should know that the joint never returns to its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	Dislocation is however that which takes place opposite the chest and nipple, or towards the rear reduction, occurs with an impact and extension with hands: until it returns, and is administered in it remaining constriction and care, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	That if it should happen after the healing of a slight weight on the limb, and sluggishness in its movement, then the sick person should often use the bath, until that weight softens, and he returns to his natural state first.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of dislocation of the cubitus.
Caput XXVIII.	Head XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the cubitus dislocates with difficulty, and also returns with difficulty; and it itself dislocates to all parts, especially to the anterior or posterior.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it falls under a sound, and under a touch, and takes whatever form it may take.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when the joint of the cubitus that has been dislocated is joined with a healthy one, it is manifest to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The joint is irritated, and it cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch the shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should, in order to do yourself justice, reduce the dislocation at once, before it has developed a heat swelling.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it should happen that the swelling is hot, its reduction is difficult; and it may well not heal completely, especially when it is directed towards the rear.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse in all forms of dislocation, and more painful to it; and it often ends with death.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And when it is restored from such dislocations as can be reduced, it extends its hands with two hands; and the arms are extended, and the thumbs of their hands are placed above the cubitus and under it, and they push the joint with their thumbs at the same time, or with the root of the palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or the dislocation is towards the front: then he returns so that he doubles his hand with his own, until he hits the cubitus that is dislocated with the root of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If he does not obey the dislocation for the purpose of reduction, then administer a powerful and sharp extension: and it is so that two ministers extend the arm; and hold him also by two ministers so that he does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is to be rotated back into place after it has been wrapped with a doubled length of cloth, or with a wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches it with his own hand, he should anoint it with oil: so that it be from those that help in lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should push the lubrication with a sharp impulso, until it is removed.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after the reduction of it, let there be placed on it an emplastre, in which sits the stifness, and drying with alum: and let it be tightened by a tightness that goes down.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm is to be suspended from the neck by the nurse: and let it be discharged after some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is to be released.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If the joint then remains firm in its own place, then dissolve the ligaments from it, and let go of it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the joint is not well tightened, then repeat the plaster, and the ligament, and let go of it for a few days, until it is tightened.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, it happens to him that he is heavy after the reduction of the joint, and there is movement in it: then administer humidification in a bath, and a subtle friction, and compression, until it is tightened, or place over the joint an iliac, that is, a nate of sheep's fat.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bind it up, and let go of it on top of her for a day and a night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it off, and put him into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When he then sweats, then rub the joint with a moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat over the top of him one time, and then two times, and then three times when he enters the bath, until it softens.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, put over it cow dung, moist, warmed with butter, and bind tightly over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this sometimes.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For herself, she is healed, and returns to her own state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	(Here) Albucasis on the treatment of dislocations.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	If (the hand) often dislocates, that is to say, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And reducing its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Conversely, those other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed is in reducing its dislocation at the hour at which it dislocates, before measurement of (the) place: or happen in that measurement heat.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And reducing the dislocation is in that (hand), so you put Mahassem of a weak hand on a table, and extends its minister hand: and puts the doctor's palm on the eminence of the joint, and pushes it, until he returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary that one considers, if the palm has already receded to the navel of the hand: then put the weak back of the hand on a table during extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is going toward the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be placed inside the table, that is, the inner part of the hand should be placed on the table, so that the doctor's palm falls over the eminence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If then he returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a plaster while it is resting, and let go of him, and do not return to it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if he does not tolerate it, and you cannot reduce it, after a few days then the joint remains according to its tortuosity: and does not hurt an invalid, unless the hand is softened, and cannot grasp anything: then you should know that nerves are cut off, or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	It is not therefore a gift in it, unless it is bound with a gauze close to its danger.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not confer something.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	For if [the surgeon] does not return the [surgery] bandage, then put it on the wound that we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then tie it and leave it for five days: then loosen it and leave it, and exercise your hands.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if his movement is restricted, and something heavy happens to him: then make it soft with warm water and sometimes rubbing, until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	[On the treatment of dislocations of the fingers].
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated completely from the rest, or if it is dislocated towards the back of the hand, or into the belly: then stretch out the finger, and push the dislocation of your thumb, until it comes back.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the end of the finger, and hang it towards the side where it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang it up, and stretch it out, until it becomes straight again in its own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	For when night comes, bind him according to the above description: and do not cease to keep him soft during the day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Make it for a few days, until it is tied up.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with him if he is dislocated towards the belly of the hand: and bind him to the side, and do your first operation with him, until he heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same with him when he is dislocated from the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	[On the treatment of dislocations of the spine].
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When something happens to anyone's spine, or if many of the vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And a sign of this is that the sick person's excrement does not come out willingly, and he cannot hold it in: and many times some member of his body, or two legs, or two arms, or one of them falls away, or one of the vertebrae is removed from its place. And often one of the vertebrae moves from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For many times, it is moved, because many times is moved their removal to the four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	But those that are moved to the back, are called Gibbositas.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure, however, is such that you consider then, if the Gibbositas occurs from puerility: then it is not in her cure, nor is there any cure from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which has occurred from accident, or percussion, or similar things, the old men have already said in long speech the methods of cure.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Whose much does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	But I have already shortened it from that, which little excuses his much from nearness to my intention: and my exposure of that which I exposed, and I formed the instrument in diverse ways from him from whom they showed that, and they exposed the same.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say, then, that in the Gibbositas which has occurred from the anterior part, is not talent, nor cure from it at all.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And likewise in that which is made on the two sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And they are not cured of those things unless that which has occurred on the back proper, for I tell you that: and it is as if it extends the sick man on his face on a level platform near the wall: and it expands under him a damp cloth so that he does not harm his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight wood is placed fixed in the ground in the end of the foot, around his head: and another wood is held around his feet in the other end of the foot: and the servant holds the wood, and does not stand firm in the ground.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other servant holds the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then a nurse turns over his head, and under his chin with leather, firm: and he extends the end of the ligament to the wood that is at his head: and binds him in it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then a different ligament is pulled above the thighs of him, and above his knees, and near to his toes.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligaments together and tie them to a different wood which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then all the ministers should extend to the part of the wood where the ligaments are tied, and they should not remove the two woods from their places where they are fixed: indeed they should not be fixed, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place his palms on the spine with strength until he has rotated it back out: or he should place it on the table.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he should attach his feet to the table with something that will not allow them to move until he has rotated them back out.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, he does not come back by this cure, then take a table whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make a hole in the wall from which we have spoken that is near to the sick man, a place where he can enter the end of the table.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the table on top of the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the doctor should place his feet on the other end of the table.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And he should tie it well so that the spine is constricted, and return to his own place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a tourniquet that is wrapped with your hand: and this is how you should do it, so that you fix on the ground near the head of the sick person two woods whose length is about one arm: and at the head of him, in the last foot of his bed, two woods.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length that is between all the wood and the palm should be one: and there has been made, in every place, a hole, through which the tourniquet runs; and all the wood should be firmly fixed on the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	Then the round wood should be inserted: and there is a tourniquet in which the ligaments run in two holes of the two woods.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is a palm with what turns with it: and there is also like it in the other two woods.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligaments that you have tightened in the chest of the patient around his neck which is at the top of him: and the ligaments that you have tightened in his thighs in a belt that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand by all the tourniquets, the one who tightens his hand with a thong, with which he is turned over: and the doctor will apply the spondyl, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the tourniquet that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, when the spondyl has been applied and the place has been made equal, then it is necessary that you put on a dried plaster with alum, which we will call "plaster".
Deinde stuppam.	Then stand up.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place above the plaster a board whose width is three fingers, or around them.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is such that it takes up the space of the gibbosity, and on the healthy side of the spondyl.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then tie with a ligament which we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And use the sick one with delicate food until he recovers.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If anything remains of the eminence in the place at the end of the recovery: then it is necessary that you administer the medicines which soften and make gentle, with the administration of the tablet which we have mentioned at a time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now is administered in that plate of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when it happens that the eminence remains at the end of the spondyl on the back: and it is thought that by means of this dislocation, and it is that very joint which has now come out.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why should not be made the supposition to him with this medicine: perhaps, in fact, will happen to kill him.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	The cure of an ankle dislocation.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the ankles and the shoulders do not happen, except for a dislocation: and they do not happen to them what happens to the other joints by a little distance, and a little sloppiness.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the ankle joint itself can be dislocated in four ways.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	It is dislocated both in front and behind.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed it is very much dislocated within; and only a little dislocated in front of and behind.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of this dislocation to the inside is: because when you join the healthy leg with the sick one, it is longer; and his knee joint rises higher than the healthy one, so that the sick person cannot double his foot under him; and there is a place that follows the hip behind the warm one, namely, because the head of the hip has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of this dislocation to the outside is that his symptoms are opposite to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of this dislocation to the front is that he spreads out the healthy leg according to the complement; but he does not double himself without pain in his knee; and if he tries to walk, he cannot stand on it in front; and he holds back his urine, and puts out his hip behind, and during walking he steps on his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of this dislocation to the back is that he does not spread his knee out, and cannot double himself without stretching his hip; and his leg is also shorter on the other side; and his hip joint is soft, and the head of the hip has reached its place there.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation is that you consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has already become accustomed with having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you administer the reduction and it remains according to its position: then it is not at all cured.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it should not be assumed that he has a full recovery.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that one whose dislocation is recent, and who has only four kinds of dislocations: then approach this so that you can join it together, and extend it both inside and outside, and move it with the right and left hand: for perhaps he will return to his own place without any other cure.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If, however, he does not respond in this way, then one should prepare the surgeon's instruments well and extend his leg from below: or with his hands, or with a band that is tied above his leg above the knee: and another surgeon shall extend his hand from above, so that he can insert his hand between the toes.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie the leg with a soft bandage below the root of the pelvis and hold the end of one of the ligaments tight.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And it should be either extended from the front part of the groin to the thigh, or from the back to the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And all these things should be done at once, so that the patient with his body is lifted off the ground and hangs by himself.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	This type of extension is a common type of four-point extension.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If, therefore, the dislocation returns with him that I mentioned, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for all the species of what I call treatment for himself to come.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction, however, when the dislocation is towards the inside, it should be laid out on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should place the bandage at the root of the pelvis, in that place which is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then he should extend the bandage from the groin side to the higher part of the body, towards the thigh.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong surgeon should take his arms, and lessen the size of the large hip that is weak, and extend it towards the outside with a sudden extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	He has already returned to his own place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type of reduction is easier for the remaining types of treatment, in which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, he refuses to enter at all with this type of treatment: then it should be tied together by two surgeons with a strong bandage, soft and smooth, over the two heels and over the two knees: and the length of each from its own beginning should be four fingers; and his leg should be extended longer by two fingers on the other side.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the sick one be hung on a tree, which is in the house; and let its length from the ground be the width of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong man to hold the sick person's feet: and let another hang with the sick person; and let another push the strong one away from the sick person with force, for the connection will return to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In recovery, however, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it should be laid out on the ground, as we have said in having a gibbus.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let it be pulled up by ligaments on his leg, the sick one himself, and on his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two logs should be placed, one at his feet, and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a log should be placed in the middle of his foot, firmly fixed; and let there be placed over it moist cloths so that they do not hurt the sick person; and let the log be placed between his thighs, so that it is not drawn towards the lower part by the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the helpers should stretch out on their side, and the doctor should make a careful reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If he then obeys to the re-location, it is good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place over it the table, and press it down, as we have said in having a gibbus, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it should be laid out on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it should be stretched out by the strong man quickly; and this same account is told about the ground: and let the doctor place his right hand palm on the sick person's thigh.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should be stretched out by the other hand, and with that stretching place him extended to the lower side of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the back: then it should not be stretched out by the sick person to the lower side, and let him lie on the ground; but rather, let him be placed on something hard, as also we said concerning his lying on two arms; and he should be on his face, and with ligaments that are extended: according to what we have just said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	It is necessary that compression be applied with a board also to the place from which the discharge has departed, when reduction is complete according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of his recovery shall not be hidden from you: and this is that you stretch out two legs for him, and when you see them equal, and the sick man tightens his leg, and extends himself without excuse: then you shall know that his member has returned, according to what is necessary: then join the two thighs together, and put on a plaster, and bind it with bandages, that is, a tourniquet: so that it may not move an inch from any part: and let him remain quiet for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligaments, and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in position, then you shall know that the dislocation is now fixed: so let the sick man walk then.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then go back, and plaster it, and bind it according to your first tightening: and let him also be kept quiet for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen that one and make him walk a little on both sides for several days, until he is comfortably healed.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	The Dislocation of the Knee Joint.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee may be dislocated three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	by the outside, by the inside, and by the bottom, that is to say, from behind.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate in front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is this: that you command the sick man to apply his leg to his thigh.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If he does not attach it to the thigh: then you shall know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all the ways of dislocation is this: that you make the sick man sit straight, so that he may extend his leg over it if he can, and attach his back to your face, and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then attach them to his knee with your palm, and place them straight between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply your two palms to the sides of his knee with determination.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another extends his leg until he returns the knee to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of the re-attachment is that the thigh should adhere to the pelvis with slowness, not forcefully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then cover it with a plaster, and attach the leg to the pelvis.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together at the same time with three or four days' worth of yarn.
Deinde solue ea.	Then dissolve them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the injured person not walk for a few days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if his reduction does not adhere to you, then administer a strong extension with ligaments, of which the preceding account was given in the cure of achilles, until he is returned to his place.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	The Cure for Dislocation of the Calcaneus
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The Calcaneus is sometimes reduced by a slight rotation, and sometimes dislocates by a second movement.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And the dislocation occurs, either internally, or externally.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of the dislocation is that you see the Calcaneus inflated, protruding towards the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The cure for the removal of the dislocation, however, is easy to reduce: and it is done by extending with ease with the hands, and adjusting, until it is returned to its place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the cure, however, when it dislocates by a second movement, you should make the sick person sit upright: and grasp him firmly from behind his back, in the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold with your right hand the leg from the upper part of it, and with your left hand at the lower part of the foot in place of the nail.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot toward you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the two fingers of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left hand and push the chest of the foot with the right hand against the thigh without working.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the chest of the foot towards the thigh in a third stroke, and you draw out the nail.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If then he returns in a single stroke or in two strokes after this manner and you see the foot even, it is good: but if not, then repeat the operation over him: for he returns again.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if you are forbidden to reduce him with it as we have said: then let the sick one lie on his back on the ground, and fasten a cloth firmly on the ground so that he falls between his knees: but now you have already spread over him a cloth, lest he be hurt.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the minister take the leg of the sick one: then let the other minister extend the foot, or with his hands, or with a band that binds around the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all the ministers extend against the extension of their own body: and let the cloth stand between the two knees of the nurse while she holds it so that the body does not move down towards the lower part during extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the doctor make the joints even with his hands, and let the other minister hold the sound thigh from below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation has returned, and it has been made known to you that the recovery is good: then let there be put a cloth and a cushion, and bind it with bands firmly, and tie the foot to the thigh with a band.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you should avoid or not be afraid of the nerves, which are above the heel, behind, lest a band should press on them and hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let go of him after two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	But if the ligament becomes soft, bind the sick one again: then let go of him on the third day or fourth: and forbid the sick one from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If one tries to walk before that space has healed, there is no security unless the dislocation is resolved, and it deteriorates, and does not receive cure after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	That if he should happen to have a hot swell: then it is necessary that you administer to him in a sedative that which we have preceded in our narration in another place from the cure, and embrocation, until it has disappeared.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Regarding the dislocation of fingers of the foot, and treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Head 25.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that he be allowed to rest with little extension without work: and this one is not difficult, on the contrary, it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If, however, the dislocation is in some of the joints of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that he should sit his injured foot on a level place of the earth, or on a table: and it is standing as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand up, and place your foot on that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then trample that with your foot with force until it turns, and you no longer feel it: and you do not appear to be standing on an edge.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under your foot a table which supports the whole foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten it with a tightening of three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then solve it, and let it rest from walking for several days, until it tightens and is secured by the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Regarding the species of dislocation with fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Head 26.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something like this has happened to him, and he desires to treat it, and to restore its health, many times death succeeds: and for this reason it is not necessary that he should make a hasty judgment about his cure, which is of this kind, unless he is prudent in the art of long use, merciful, gentle, slow, not bold, and not presumptuous: and that he should employ in the beginning of medicines which sit on the hot apostemes: and let him abandon the sick to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	If you do not expect healing, nor hope for deliverance from destruction with patience towards disease, and when it seems that there is some hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Then consider the reduction of this at once at the beginning of the thing, before the fever occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	But if the limb returns to health as we intended, then administer a regimen that calms the fever; and take care of the sore with the ointment from dry herbs at the same time.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	That if the dislocation is with a fracture and they happen to separate in a boney place, then consider removing them, and do in that what we said in simple diseases because it preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be careful according to your virtue, and guard yourself from the entrance into a state of fear: for my prediction has preceded you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your creator, and more enduring to your glory, and healthier for your body among them at your time.
