of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or the neck is dislocated, or if there are several dislocated, there is no cure, because death quickly takes the patient.
And the sign is that the excrement comes out involuntarily, and he cannot hold it, and often some limbs are paralyzed, either both thighs or both arms or one.
And often the spine is displaced in four parts;
that which is displaced to the rear is called "gibbosity": (or hunchback)
The treatment is that you look to see if the gibbosity has come from childhood:
then there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from a fall or blows or similar things, the ancients spoke of methods of treatment with grand words, where there is not much benefit in any of them;
but I have shortened it according to my understanding, and have fashioned instruments in various ways.
I say that for the gibbosity that comes on the chest in front, there is no remedy nor health;
and also that which comes directly on both sides, and one cannot treat except properly that which comes on the back, as I say; 
and the patient should be lying on their face in a level place, and have padding beneath them so they do not injure themselves;
then firmly fix a firebrand in the ground at the head, and another at the feet, and tie a cord beneath the armpits of the patient, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants hold the cords, one at the head and the other at the feet, across the two firebrands;
and let them be firmly fixed, the firebrands as we have said, and the physician places his palms firmly on the spine until it returns to place.
And if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board three cubits long, and dig beneath the wall, and let the patient be on their side, and put the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine;
and let the physician place his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, you can do this with a winch that is turned by hand.
And you should place two firebrands at the patient's head, an arm's length away, and towards the feet two others, and there should be between each firebrand, above and below, a handspan of space in length;
and each firebrand should have a hole through which the winch runs, and the firebrands should be firmly fixed in the ground so that they do not move;
and between each two firebrands there should be a turning bar, around which the ropes turn, and on the two turning bars, two small bars a handspan long, to turn the winch;
and then tie the rope that is through the armpits to the winch towards the head, and the other rope towards the feet to the other winch, and each of the assistants turns his winch with all the rope, and the physician places the spine straight as we have described.
And when it is straight, apply a desiccative plaster with plenty of egg, then the compresses, and then the splint of a small board three fingers long, so that it covers the place of the gibbosity and the healthy part of the vertebra, then tie it with a bandage, as we have said, and the patient should consume a light diet until he is healed;
and if any problem arises at the end of the healing process, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medications, along with the splint that we mentioned previously;
and sometimes a piece of lead is applied there, and sometimes the appearance arises in the last vertebra of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation;
and it is the bone that is showing, therefore one should not be presumptuous about it:
perhaps it would cause death.
