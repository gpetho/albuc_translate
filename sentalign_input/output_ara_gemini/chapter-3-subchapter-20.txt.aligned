Look, if the complication is soft, then use astringent medicines in it, such as aloe vera, frankincense, myrrh, spikenard, acacia, and the like, by taking some or all of these and kneading them with an astringent syrup or with egg white or with vinegar, and apply it to the complication in a poultice and tie it tightly and leave the bandage without loosening it for many days, then loosen it and repeat it until the complication is gone, God willing.	Examine it, and if the callus be soft, apply astringent remedies to it, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, balsam of sarcocol, acacia, and the like. Take some or all of these; beat them up with a dry wine or egg-white or vinegar, apply to the callus on some tow and bind up firmly. Leave the bandaging on for many days; then undo it and repeat until the callus is removed, God willing.	0.8089894

But if the callus is stony hard and its removal is urgent, incise the place and cut away the superfluous prominence, or pare it away with a scraper until it is gone; and dress the wound until it heals.	0.7577603
