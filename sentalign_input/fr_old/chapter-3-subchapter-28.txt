The dislocation of the hand  
The joints of the hand dislocate, and their reduction is easier, more than other joints. However, it must be reduced quickly, at the same time it is dislocated, before the area swells or a hot abscess forms.  
And the reduction is done by placing the injured hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and the practitioner aligns it, placing his palm on the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.  
However, it is necessary to check if it is well placed; then have the patient place the back of his hand on the table for extension and reduction.  
And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, let the patient place the back of his hand on the table, and the practitioner places his hand on the prominence of the joint. If it returns immediately, that is good.  
If not, bind it with plasters soothing hot abscesses, and leave it without reapplying.  
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it back in place after a few days, the joint remains twisted.  
And it does not harm the patient except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves are cut, or the arteries; and there is no other remedy except cauterization near the area, and possibly nothing else will help.  
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then untie it and leave it like that.  
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, bathe it in warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
