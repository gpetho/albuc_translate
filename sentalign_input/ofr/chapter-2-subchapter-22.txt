of the swelling of the eye
This disease which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a swelling that has gathered in the eye, resembling descending water, and it is not water; and the manner of the appearance of the procedure is that you have the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take his head in your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the swelling come to the top before your eyes; then it should be pierced, so that it doesn't descend and the light is unobstructed, and the patient sees things as he used to; and if it doesn't descend, know that it is water, and if the descent of the swelling is not as we have described.
have the patient sit between your hands, then take the fine spatula and make a small hole on the cornea through the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the corona, so that the swelling comes out; and when it has come out, instill into the eye warm water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled and honey, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
