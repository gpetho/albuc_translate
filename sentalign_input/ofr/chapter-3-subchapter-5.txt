Of the forceps/tweezers
The forceps often break forward, towards the shoulder, and the breakage occurs in three ways:
or it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure is as follows when the fracture is without a wound: you should have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder where the forceps/clavicle is broken;
and the other extends the neck towards the side;
then set the fracture evenly with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither a bump nor a depression.
And if you need to extend it further, place a round bolster made of cloth, or wool, under the patient's shoulder, and its thickness should be according to your need;
and extend and lift the clavicle, and press down on the bolster with your hand, so that you evenly set the fracture, as is necessary.
And if you cannot draw the end of the clavicle outwards, because it goes inwards too deeply, then the patient must lie often on his back, and place a medium-sized pillow under the shoulder, and the practitioner pushes the shoulder down, until the bone of the clavicle is raised.
And then straighten the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it shattered, then you must cut into it;
and gently pull out the pieces, and if the bone cannot be joined because of some overlapping, then trim it with one of the incisors that you have;
but you should place this instrument under the clavicle, to protect the periosteum:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and is as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the requirements of the work;
and it has two heads, as you see, and one is wide, and the other is narrow, like the shape of the wound that you made when you pulled out the bones;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, then stitch the wound, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with compresses and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses develop there, soak a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The tightening of the bone, when it is without wounds and without incision, is that you put on the bone a plaster of mill dust and egg white, and put light padding on it, and put a splint under the armpit, if you need it;
then take a very large bandage, a palm wide, then put a doubled cloth over the padding and the plaster;
then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around the bandage so that the ends of the bandage hang down;
and place the splint over the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck and under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit;
and bring it around from each side, and when you see that the bandaging holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the splint does not move on the broken bone, then check it every day, and when the bandaging loosens, tighten it;
and have the patient lie on his back, and when he sleeps, put a small pillow under his armpit to raise the shoulder up;
this will relieve the pressure on the fracture by easing the shoulder, or you can tie his arm to his neck and not untie it unless some bad incident occurs, until twenty days have passed;
then reapply the plaster, if you see that there is need for it, and tighten it and leave it thus, until he is recovered;
and it is restored in most cases within twenty-eight days, and in some men, sooner.
