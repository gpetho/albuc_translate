Chapter 69.
On castration.
You should know that castration in our law is excommunicated, but for a reason it is allowed for me to remember it in this book; and its remembrance is necessary only for two reasons, one is so that it is in the knowledge of the doctor when asked about it, that he knows the treatment for the one it happens to; and the other reason is that we often need to castrate other animals for our benefit, such as horses, goats, pigs, and similar animals.
So I say that castration is done in two ways: either by attrition, or by incision and cutting.
But in the one that is done by attrition, the way of the operation is that we make the animal sit in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down.
Then take them in your hand until they are dissolved and do not appear under touch.
But in castration done by incision and cutting, you need to hold the animal and press the covering of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory, and cut over each testicle with an incision until both testicles protrude.
Then cut those more that you have exposed.
And do not leave any part of the sac on them, except the subtle sac that is over the bases.
And this manner of castration is better than the one done by attrition, because strong attrition leaves some part of the testicles that causes the animal to desire mating.
Then treat the wound until it is healed.
