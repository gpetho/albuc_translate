On the Treatment of Imperforate Anus	On the treatment of unperforated female pudenda.	0.64018106
Imperforate anus is when the woman's vulva is not perforated or the opening is small. This can either be congenital, something she is born with, or accidental. The accidental type occurs due to a preceding cause, and it results from excess, protruding flesh.	This condition is when a woman's pudenda have no opening or have only a tiny opening; it may be either congenital or acquired. The acquired sort is due to some preceding disease; either to a fleshy growth or to a membrane, thick or thin.	0.77814806
Or a thin or thick membrane, and it may be in the depths of the uterus, or in its sides, or in its top or bottom.  It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and sometimes it prevents menstruation.  Knowledge of it is through examination by the midwife.	It may be in the fundus of the uterus or in its walls or in the upper part or in the lower part; and it prevents intercourse, conception, and delivery; it often also hinders the menses. This is recognized by inspection by the midwife, if the obstruction be obvious and low.	0.8570446
If the obstruction is apparent and near, (treat it). If it is not apparent, then examine it with your fingers or with a probe. If the obstruction is of a thin membrane and it is near the labia, then immediately perforate it. That is, you should place something like supports on the labia, then place both of your thumbs.	But if it be not visible she should palpate with her fingers or with a probe. And when the obstruction is due to a thin membrane near the labia you should lose no time in breaking it down. This is done by applying some sort of pad to the labia; then put both thumbs upon it.	0.7456257
With the woman on her back and her legs spread apart, then stretch the labia forcefully until the thin membrane ruptures and the obstruction opens. Then take some wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area. Have the woman engage in intercourse every day so that the area does not rejoin.	The woman should be upon her back with her legs spread wide apart; then the labia are to be stretched strongly till the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is laid open. Then take wool soaked in oil and apply to the place, and let the woman engage in coitus every day lest the place close over.	0.90419674
If the membrane is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel resembling an ace of spades. If the obstruction is from protruding flesh, grasp it with hooks and cut it. You should have with you medications that stop bleeding without stinging, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.	If the membrane be thick and strong you should incise it with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel. But if the obstruction be due to a growth you should catch hold of it with two hooks and cut it away. And have at hand remedies for allaying haemorrhage without pain, such as acacia and dragon's blood and olibanum, all mixed with egg-white.	0.7988554
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly; keep it in for several days.  Use a wick of dry linen. Then treat it with other wound-healing treatments until it is cured.  Another fleshy growth may occur in the uterus; it should be cut in this same manner.	Then use a cannula of lead to prevent the wound healing up too quickly. She should keep it in position for some days and employ a bandage of dry linen. Then treat with the usual healing dressings until it heals.	0.8233316
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, for a cancerous tumor that occurs in the uterus should never be touched with an iron instrument.	Sometimes other growths of flesh arise in the uterus itself; you should cut away in this manner all except cancerous tumours; for a cancerous tumour arising in the uterus is under no circumstance to be treated with the knife.	0.6111208
