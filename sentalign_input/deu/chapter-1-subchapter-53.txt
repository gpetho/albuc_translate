Chapter Fifty-Three:
On the cauterization of calluses and similar conditions.
Often, a disease called "clau" (callus) appears on the lower parts of the foot, causing thick, painful skin that injures the foot; cautery for these can be done in two ways: with fire or with hot water.
Fire cautery involves heating a concave cautery tool resembling a vulture's claw, made of iron, matching the size of the callus, with thin edges.
Then place the heated tool on the callus and move it around the callus until the cautery penetrates the callus completely.
Leave it for three days until it starts to throw off the callus.
Then plaster it with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on overnight, as it will eradicate the callus from its roots.
Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
If this doesn't work, and this often happens on the skin surface, especially on the hands and feet, then you need to apply hot water cautery. Take a cannula made of brass, iron, or a vulture's feather, and place it on the callus; pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, compressing it fully with your hand, and pressing the cannula's edge into the callus root. The hot water will find its way to the root. The patient should endure the hot water's bite for an hour, then remove it, as the callus with its roots will be eradicated.
Do the same for all such calluses on the body.
Then treat them with ointments that generate flesh once the callus roots are eradicated.
