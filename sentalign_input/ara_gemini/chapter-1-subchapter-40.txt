Chapter forty on cauterizing hip dislocation.
Erroneous/Harmful humors may flow to the hip joint, causing it to be dislocated.
And its sign is that one leg becomes longer than the other when you compare them to each other.
And you find a gap at the site of the dislocation.
It is necessary to cauterize the patient on the hip joint itself with a semi-circular cautery after marking with ink around the joint as it rotates, so that the joint itself falls in the center of the circle.
And use the cautery whose image is presented in stomach cauterization.
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it three times with the large olive-shaped cautery.
And make the depth of the cauterization equal to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then treat him until he recovers, God willing.
