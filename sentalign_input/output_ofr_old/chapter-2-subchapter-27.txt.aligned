About abscesses of the lips	On the extraction of nodules occurring on the lip.	0.56174344
In many men, hard abscesses, resembling grains of vetch, form inside the lips, both smaller and larger; then you must turn the lips, and cut above each knot, and take it with pincers and cut it in each part; then fill the area after the incision with ground vitriol until the blood is staunched; and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with drying substances until it is healed.	A good many people sometimes get little hard swellings inside their lips, some resembling the vetch grain; some larger, some smaller. You should invert the lip, incise all along each nodule, catch it up with a hook, and cut it away all round. Then after incising rub pounded vitriol into the places until the bleeding stops. Then let him rinse with vinegar and salt, and dress the place with styptic drugs till the wounds heal.	0.8896531
