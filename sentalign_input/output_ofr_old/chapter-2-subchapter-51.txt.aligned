Of the large hanging swellings Sometimes thelul occurs in the belly and nowhere else, and it is a disease called "fungus" because of its resemblance to fungi, with a thin root and a large head; and there are small and very large ones;	On the amputation of warts occurring on the belly. Some people often get warts on the belly and on the rest of the body, called fungous warts, because of their resemblance to fungi. They have a slender pedicle and a broad head, the edges of which are sometimes inverted ; and some are small, whereas others of them grow very big.	0.7359723
and I saw a man who had two on his belly that were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, with thin roots, and were already split, and moisture was constantly flowing from them.	I myself once saw a man who had two warts on his belly that looked more like fungi than anything else; they were white and had thin pedicles. Their edges were inverted and had split open, and a humour flowed continually from them.	0.8420985
I cut them and found one weighing 18 ounces, and the other 6 ounces, and the procedure for the incision is that you see if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white and moist with thin roots;	I amputated them both and weighed them: one came to about eighteen ounces, and the other six ounces. This is the operation for amputating them: examine the patient carefully, and if he be of a humid temperament and the colour of the warts be white, and if they are soft, with a thin stalk, amputate them with a broad scalpel.	0.71985817
then cut it with a broad spatula, and have the cautery ready in the fire. Because often there is too much blood flow during the cutting, and if the blood overwhelms you, then quickly cauterize it;	But you should also have at hand cauteries in a fire; for often in amputating them there is much haemorrhage. So, if the bleeding be a hindrance to you, be quick and cauterize them.	0.72906
and if you see the patient is frightened and afraid of the knife incision, take a well-made lead thread, and tie the growth as we have said, and leave it for two days;	On the other hand if you see that the patient is frightened and dreads the cutting of them with the scalpel, take a wire of stout lead, and ligature this type of wart and leave for two days.	0.6951365
then tighten it, and keep tightening the lead thread until it cuts through the growth, and it falls off by itself without trouble; and if the roots are large, it is dangerous to cut, especially for the belly, but you can cut half of it,	Then increase the stricture by the lead wire and go on doing this as it sinks into the wart, until the wart is cut through and spontaneously falls away with no trouble. But if the warts have stout pedicles there is some risk and fear in the cutting of them, especially those that occur on the belly. Sometimes, however, you can cut away the half, or some part, and then cauterize to prevent recurrence.	0.7468159
then cauterize it so it doesn't return; then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the thelul that is of dark color and poor quality and looks bad.	Then dress until the wound is healed. But beware of trying to cut away growths that are dark in colour, with little sensation and hideous in appearance, for they are cancerous tumours.	0.62911236
Because it is a cancerous abscess, and I will come to the treatment of cancer later.	I shall soon be mentioning cancer.	0.4153793
