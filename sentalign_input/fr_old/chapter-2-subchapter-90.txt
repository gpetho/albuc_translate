Of the veins
Vis are large veins enveloped and full of melancholic excesses, which occur in various parts of the body;
and they occur more in the legs of those who walk and work and carry loads, than in others.
It is therefore necessary that you sometimes administer purgatives for bile, and then treat it with basilica (a type of medicinal herb).
The treatment with iron is done in two ways: one is to cut them and draw out the black blood;
and the other way is to lift the vein and draw it all out.
The cutting is done in this manner: first pour very hot water on the leg, until the thick blood is thinned,
then squeeze the patient's leg from above the thigh to below the knee;
then cut the vein in one place, or two or three, with a wide cut,
then elevate and draw out the black blood by hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood flows as the patient's strength can tolerate;
and then tie it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The lifting is done in this manner: shave the patient's leg if there is much hair,
then put him in a bath, and pour hot water on his leg until it turns red and the veins swell;
and if you don't have a bath, heat it by the fire, and then cut along the vein from the top of the knee, or the part below at the ankle;
then open the skin with the hook, and strip the vein on each side, until it appears when touched;
and it looks red and black, and when it enters the skin it looks like a white cord;
then put the hook underneath, until it is lifted from the skin, and then hang it lightly with the hook,
then cut it in another place about three fingers up; then strip the skin over the vein until it appears,
then lift it with the hook as you did before, and hang it on another hook, as you did the first time;
then cut another incision, or more if needed, then lift it, and cut it at the toe of the foot,
then draw and lift it to the second incision; then extract it from cut to cut, until it comes all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot draw and lift it, insert a needle with a strong double thread,
and tie and draw it, and place a hook underneath, and turn your hand one way and the other, until it comes out;
and be careful it does not break, because if it does, it cannot be drawn or lifted, and it harms the patient;
and when you have drawn it all out, place wool soaked in wine and rose oil on the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is twisted and entangled together, and it is not straight, as we have said,
it is necessary to cut it crookedly, but not cut it; and draw it as we have said before.
The shape of the iron used to cut the vein is curved, and does not cut unless it cuts the vein;
and it is of a large curve, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but it should be thick as we have said, and here is the shape:
