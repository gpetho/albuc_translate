of the stitching of the eyelid
When this adhesion happens to some men in such a way that the upper eyelid is attached to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must insert the point of a razor under the eyelid, and lift it upwards;
and stretch it with small tweezers, until you cut what is stuck with a subtle spatula, which should not be too sharp or too cutting, so that the patient can tolerate it and the too sharp spatula does not injure the eye;
and make your incision, with which you peel away this adhesion, lightly, so that the eyelid returns to its natural shape;
and this entire adhesion is healed, and they sometimes put salt water in the eye, and then rinse it with fresh water, and with an eyewash;
then place between the eyelid and the eye a linen tent, and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white;
and after the third day, use the eyewash and desiccating remedies until it is healed.
