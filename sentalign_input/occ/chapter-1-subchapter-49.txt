Chapter Forty-Nine:
On the cauterization of albaras (white patches), which is morphea.
When albaras is old and does not respond to any medical ointment, then cauterize it with a deep cautery slightly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness and color are removed and the color is changed.
Then treat it with barley and lentil flour mixed with rose oil, leaves of arnagrosa, and blood of a pigeon or swallow. Each should be in equal parts, all mixed together, and then spread on a cloth and placed on the area until it heals.
