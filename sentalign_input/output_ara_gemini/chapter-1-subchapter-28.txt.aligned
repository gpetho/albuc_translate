Chapter twenty-eight on treating liver swelling with cauterization.	CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT. On incising a tumour of the liver with the cautery.	0.772508
If an abscess appears in the liver and you want to know whether that swelling is in the liver's parenchyma or in its membrane, then if it is in the parenchyma, the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.	When there is an abscess in the liver and you are anxious to know if the tumour is in the body of the liver or in its capsule: if it is in the substance of the liver, the patient will be suffering from a feeling of heaviness and no very acute pain.	0.7603461
And if it is in the liver's membrane, there will be intense sharpness with the pain. And I have seen that its treatment has baffled physicians, so the patient should lie on his back.	But if it is in the capsule of the liver there will be the sharpest intensity of pain and you will see that it has baffled the doctors.	0.6780535
And I have seen that its treatment has baffled physicians, so the patient should lie on his back. Then mark the swollen area with ink.	Then the patient should lie back on his neck; then mark the place of the swelling with ink.	0.69749236
Then heat the cautery iron in the fire, and it is the cautery iron that resembles the probe, and this is its image: And cauterize it with a single cauterization until you burn all the skin. And continue with the cauterization to the peritoneum until all the pus comes out.	Then heat the cautery in the fire, this being the cautery resembling a probe, of this form, and with that make one cauterization till the whole thickness of the skin is burnt through, finishing up at the capsule so that all the purulent matter comes out.	0.7930666
Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.	Then apply the treatment for wounds.	0.6275132
And this type of cauterization should not be used except by someone who has long training in the art of medicine and has treated these diseases with experience repeatedly.	This kind of cauterization should not be employed except by one who has a long experience of the medical art and who has frequent practice at dealing with this kind of disease.	0.84549505
Only then should he undertake such a procedure.	Then he can undertake this kind of operation.	0.7584439
And leaving it (untreated) in my opinion is better.	But in my opinion it would be better to pass it by.	0.554437
