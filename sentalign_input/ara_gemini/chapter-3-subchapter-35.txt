Chapter Thirty-Five: On the types of jaw dislocation that occurs with a wound or with a fracture or with both of them.
Whenever something like this happens, and you intend to treat it and fix it, it often results in death.
Therefore, no one should attempt to treat such a thing except someone who is skilled in the craft, long-experienced, gentle, compassionate, deliberate, neither reckless nor daring.
And he should use, in the beginning, only the medicines that soothe hot swellings and entrust the sick person to fate - God willing - except for what you hope for his safety from damage, along with the mildness of the illness and you see in it some hope.
So send him away immediately at the beginning of the matter before the hot swelling occurs, and if the limb returns to what you wanted, then use the regimen that soothes hot swellings and treat the wound with appropriate drying ointments.
If the jaw is fractured and bone fragments that are loose occur, then extract them and follow in that what we mentioned in simple diseases from what preceded in their places.
And strive your utmost and keep yourself from entering the path of risks, as I have previously advised you, for that is more preserving of your prestige and safer for your honor, God willing.
