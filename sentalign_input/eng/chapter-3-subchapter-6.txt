 CHAPTER six.
On the repair of a fracture of the scapula.
The scapula is rarely fractured in the broad part but it does break at its margins.
When any part of it is broken or it breaks in the middle (which is recognized by palpation) you should attempt the correction of the fracture according to the shape it takes, and its restoration to its natural form, by whatever means you can.
Then apply over the place mill-dust with eggwhite, and soft tow; and over that a dressing made of a folded cloth; and over that a broad splint made of thin board to the size of the whole scapula or a little wider.
If there be beneath the splint a hollow in any part of the scapula, level it with soft tow so that the splint rests evenly.
Then bind tightly over it a long sling and make sure that the splint does not slip out of place.
Examine the bandage daily; and whenever it gets loose tighten it and adjust the splint if it has shifted.
The patient should lie on his sound side.
The scapula mends in twenty or twenty-five days.
When this time has elapsed you may safely loosen the bandaging, for this is one of the bones in which there is no danger of fragmentation or cracking.
If a splinter of bone protrudes and starts to prick under the skin, cut down upon it and remove it, and do as I said under fracture of the collar-bone, to allay the effusion, if anything of that kind happen.
