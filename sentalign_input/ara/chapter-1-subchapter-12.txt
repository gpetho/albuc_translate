Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing watery eyes.
If you ascertain the beginning of watery eyes by the signs mentioned in the classification, then hasten to have the patient drink what cleanses his head and protects him from all moistures, and have him sweat in the bath while fasting for several days.
Then have him shave his head and cauterize it in the middle of the head, then cauterize him twice on the temples if the beginning of the watering is in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.
Then cauterize all the veins and arteries that are under the skin with the cautery iron, and let the cauterizations be the length and width of the temples, and beware of bleeding.
If you see any bleeding, stop it immediately with any treatment you can, and we will discuss the wisdom of incising arteries, cutting them, and guarding against bleeding.
Two deep cauterizations may also be made on the nape of the neck, under the two bones.
