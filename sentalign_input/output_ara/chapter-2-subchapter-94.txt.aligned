On Extracting Arrows.	On the extraction of arrows.	0.8906903
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the locations in which they occur in the body. As for their difference according to their types, some of them are large and small, some are hollow glass and solid glass, and some of them have three angles and four angles.	Arrows vary both as to types and as to the different parts of the body pierced by them. They differ thus as to type: some are big and some are small; some with hollow heads and some with solid; some of them have three angles and some four; some have tongues; some have spikes.	0.86571544
And some of them have tongues, and some of them have splinters. As for those that are according to the organs in which they occur, they are of two types: either the organs are among the principal hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. So when an arrow strikes one of these organs and the signs of death appear to you, which I will describe to you later, then you should avoid removing that arrow from them, because death follows its owner in most cases. And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not disappeared into the depths of the organ, then remove it and treat the wound. And among the signs of the brain if an arrow strikes it and pierces the bone and wounds the membrane that is on the brain, a severe headache, torpor, and dizziness occur from that.	The difference due to the part transfixed by the arrow is twofold: for there are either the chief hollow organs such as the brain, the heart, the liver, the lungs, the kidneys, intestine, bladder, and so forthâ€”when one of these arrows transfixes an organ of this kind, and you observe the signs of death which I shall describe to you later, then you must avoid the extraction of the arrow in that case, for death will generally follow; but when you do not see these fatal signs and the arrow is not quite buried in the depths of the organ, then extract it and dress the wound.	0.8675288
And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not disappeared into the depths of the organ, then remove it and treat the wound. And among the signs of the brain if an arrow strikes it and pierces the bone and wounds the membrane that is on the brain, a severe headache, torpor, and dizziness occur from that. And redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, and vomiting bile. And perhaps blood comes out of the nostrils or ears, and perhaps speech is interrupted and the voice is gone, and a white moisture resembling porridge comes out of the place of the wound, and something like the water of meat flows from it.	Now the signs when the arrow has struck the brain, and penetrated the bone and injured the meninges covering the brain, are these: there arise from that a violent headache and vertigo and giddiness and a redness in the eye, and a redness of the tongue, and convulsion and mental confusion and bilious vomit; perhaps also blood comes out of the nose or from the ears; often also the speech is affected and the voice is lost; also there comes out of the site of the wound a white fluid which resembles gruel, from which there flows something like the juice of meat.	0.8515275
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not come out. As for the signs of the arrow if it strikes the heart and is close to the left breast, it feels as if it has been embedded in something solid, not in something empty.	If you observe these signs, avoid treating the patient and extraction of the arrow if it has not come out.	0.6691002
And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by coldness of the extremities, a cold sweat, and fainting. Know that death is inevitably descending.  And the sign of the arrow if it wounds the lung is the emergence of frothy blood from the wound.	The signs of an arrow in the heart are: nearness to the left breast; the patient feels it as if it were fixed in something solid, not hollow; often also there will be imparted to the arrow a pulsating movement; and black blood will issue from the wound; and after this follow coldness of the extremities and a cold sweat and unconsciousness; then you may know that death is surely on its way.	0.7721076
And the vessels that follow the neck swell, and the patient's color changes, and he breathes heavily and seeks to inhale cool air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm that is in the chest, it will be close to the small ribs and breathing will be labored with severe pain.	The sign of an arrow that has wounded the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound; also the vessels that lie along the neck swell up and the patient changes colour, breathes heavily, and seeks to inhale fresh air very strongly. But if the arrow strike the pleura then it will be close to the small ribs and he will breathe deeply with much pain and heaving of the chest, and all parts of his shoulders will be agitated.	0.8097951
And he sighs and all the members of the shoulders move. And if the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain follows it, and blood resembling the liver in its redness comes out of the wound. And if the arrow strikes the stomach, some undigested food may come out of the wound.	But if the arrow strike the pleura then it will be close to the small ribs and he will breathe deeply with much pain and heaving of the chest, and all parts of his shoulders will be agitated. If the arrow hits the liver, there ensues violent pain, and blood flows from the wound, resembling the liver in its redness. If the arrow strikes the stomach, often undigested food comes out of the wound and renders the case obvious.	0.7655866
And its matter is apparent. And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and sticks in it, and something of the stool comes out of the wound, or the omentum, or an intestine has been perforated, then there is no hope in treating him nor in removing the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder, urine comes out.	If the arrow wounds the belly and is fixed in it, and from the wound there comes excrement or omentum or torn bowel, there is no hope in treatment nor in extracting the arrow. If the arrow has hit the urinary bladder, and urine comes out and some of the bladder protrudes and the patient has violent pain, then you may know that the wound is mortal.	0.8109523
And if something protrudes from it to the outside, and the pain intensifies on the patient, know that he is perishing. As for the other organs, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, upper arm, spine, clavicle, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are most often safe.	But as for the other parts, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, dorsal vertebrae, collar-bone, hip, leg, and the like, in most cases they will heal if the arrow does not happen to strike an artery or nerve, and if the arrow is not poisoned.	0.72485083
When the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned. And I will tell you some of what I have witnessed regarding these arrows so that you may be guided by it in your treatment. An arrow struck a man in the corner of his eye at the root of his nose.	Now I will relate to you certain cases of arrow wounds that I have seen, so that you may be guided thereby to your own methods of treatment. For example, once an arrow struck a man at the corner of his eye near the root of the nose, and I extracted it from him on the other side beneath the lobe of his ear, and he got well, and his eye was none the worse.	0.69071066
I extracted it for him from the other side, under the earlobe, and he recovered and no harm happened to his eye. I extracted another arrow for a Jew who had been struck in the corner of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had disappeared, and I could only find its small end that attaches to the shaft.	Also I extracted from a Jew another arrow that had pierced the orbit beneath the lower eyelid; the arrow had sunk out of sight and I could take hold only of the tiny extremity of it which is secured to the shaft; but it was a big arrow from a compound bow, the iron tip four-sided, very smooth without barbs. The Jew recovered, nor did any ill befall his eye.	0.85087025
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, with smooth, square iron, and it had no barbs. The Jew recovered, and no ill befel his eye. I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabian.	I also extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.	0.49089247
It is the one with two barbs. I made an incision for him between the jugular veins, and it had sunk into his throat. I treated him gently until I extracted it, and the Christian survived and recovered. I extracted another arrow for a man who had been struck in his abdomen, and we thought that he would die from it.	It was an Arab arrow, one of those with two barbs; and I cut down upon it between the two jugulars (for it lay deep in the throat), and worked gently at it until I extracted it; and the Christian was saved and recovered. I also extracted another arrow from a man, that had struck him in the abdomen, and our opinion was that he would certainly die from it.	0.89634645
When he remained for a period of thirty days or so, and nothing in his condition changed, I made an incision over the arrow and worked on it carefully, and I extracted it, and he recovered, and no ill befel him. I saw a man who had been struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound closed over it.	But when it had remained in him for the space of thirty days or thereabouts, and his condition was unimpaired, I cut down upon the arrow and manoeuvred it out and extracted it; and he recovered, nor did any harm befall him.	0.8304461
Then, after seven years, the arrow came out at the top of his thigh. I saw a woman who had been struck in her abdomen by an arrow, and the wound closed, and the arrow remained, and nothing in her condition changed, nor did she feel any harm from it in any of her natural functions.	I also saw a man who had been struck in the back by an arrow and the wound had closed over it; and when the space of seven years had elapsed the arrow came out at the root of the hip. And I saw a woman who had been struck in the abdomen by an arrow and the wound healed with the arrow remaining in it, and her condition was unimpaired; she felt no harm from it and her natural functions were not harmed.	0.8540067
And I saw another man who was struck by an arrow in his face, and the wound closed, and it remained without him feeling much pain. And of such cases there are many. I extracted an arrow for a man, one of the sultan's commanders, who had been struck in the middle of his nose; it had deviated slightly to the right side.	And I saw a man who had been struck by an arrow in the face, and it had healed over, and he did not feel much pain from it. And many such have I seen. I once drew out an arrow from one of the officers of the State, that had struck him in the middle of the nose and was inclining a little to the right, and the whole arrow was buried.	0.90166664
And the entire arrow disappeared. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck him. I found the arrow's wound very narrow, so I probed it with a thin probe, but I did not feel it.  He felt a prickling and pain under his ear on the right side.	I was called to treat him three days after he had received the arrow wound; and I found the arrow wound very narrow. I explored it with a fine probe but did not find it; but the patient felt a pricking and a pain beneath the right ear, and I hoped that the pricking was due to the arrow.	0.8613266
I hoped that the prickling was from the tip of the arrow.  So I dressed the area with a dressing that had the power to draw and ripen, hoping that the area would swell and a sign of the arrow would appear, so that I could make an incision over it. But nothing happened in the area to indicate that the arrow had reached that spot.	So I applied a poultice to the spot, a poultice with power to draw out and cause suppuration, desiring that the place should swell and that a sign to indicate the arrow should appear so that I could cut down upon it.	0.74259615
So I continued with the dressing on it for many days, but nothing happened. Then during that time the wound closed and the patient remained despairing of its removal for a period, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. He told me the news, so I applied the sharp, corrosive medication to the wound for many days.	But nothing happened at that place to indicate that the arrow had come through to there; so I persevered with poulticing it for many days; yet nothing fresh manifested itself and the wound healed up meanwhile, and the patient despaired for a time of its extraction. Then one day he felt the arrow inside his nose, and he told me of this; so for a number of days I applied a caustic medicine to the wound until it opened.	0.8727589
Until it opened and I probed it. I felt the thin tip of the arrow that adheres to the shaft.  Then I continued to open the wound with that sharp medication until the tip of the arrow became clearly visible to us. This took me a period of time, about four months.	I explored it, and felt the slim end of the arrow which is fastened to the shaft; then I enlarged the opening of the wound by the use of the caustic until the tip of the arrow was plainly visible to me. About four months passed.	0.831529
Then when the wound widened and it became possible for me to insert hooks into it, I pulled and moved it, but it would not come out. I continued to coax it and try various instruments on it, until one day I grasped it with well-made hooks, the image of which will come at the end of the chapter.	Then when the wound was enlarged and I was able to introduce forceps into it I pulled on it and moved it, but it would not come out. And I went on skilfully and gently trying for it with various instruments until one day I caught hold of it with a pair of strong forceps (their shape will be described at the end of the chapter) and drew it out; then dressed the wound.	0.90488017
And the physicians were certain that the cartilage of his nose would not heal. But I treated it, and the wound healed, and the patient recovered completely, not harmed at all. I am informing you of the method of extracting some arrows so that you may use that as a standard and a guide for what I have not mentioned.	The medical men judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound healed up and the patient made a complete recovery nor did he suffer any harm. Now I shall tell you the method of extracting certain arrows so that you may take it as a guide and an analogy for others that I have not mentioned; since all parts and details of this art cannot be comprehended in any description, nor can any book include them.	0.86563706
Because the details and particulars of this craft cannot be grasped by description, nor can a book encompass it. Rather, the skilled practitioner extrapolates from the little to the much, and from what is present to what is absent, and devises a new procedure and a new instrument for unusual incidents.	Now I shall tell you the method of extracting certain arrows so that you may take it as a guide and an analogy for others that I have not mentioned; since all parts and details of this art cannot be comprehended in any description, nor can any book include them. A skilful worker will form a judgement on much, from little; and on what is not present from what is before him; and he will think out a new method and a new instrument for an unaccustomed case when it occurs in the practice of this art.	0.75164205
Concerning the extraction of arrows from this profession, I say that arrows are extracted from the organs in which they are lodged in two ways: either by pulling from the place where they entered, or from the opposite side.  Those which are extracted from where they entered...	So I would state that arrows come out from the parts of the body they have transfixed, in two ways: either by drawing out from the site of entry; or from the opposite side. An arrow that comes out by the track of its entry: the arrow may be visible, standing out from a fleshy part, in which case it may be extracted by pulling.	0.7561923
...if the arrow is protruding in a fleshy area, it is pulled and extracted. If it does not yield to extraction at the time it occurred, then you should leave it for several days until the flesh around it putrefies, making it easy to pull and extract. Likewise, if it is lodged in bone.	An arrow that comes out by the track of its entry: the arrow may be visible, standing out from a fleshy part, in which case it may be extracted by pulling. If it does not respond to traction immediately it strikes, you must leave it for a few days until the surrounding tissues have suppurated, when the pulling and extraction of it will be made easy.	0.73888856
And if it does not yield to extraction, also leave it for days and try pulling and moving it every day, for it will come out. If it does not yield to extraction after several days, then you should perforate around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine perforator until you widen [the hole] for the arrow, then pull and extract it.	Similarly if it has stuck fast in a bone and will not come out, leave this also for a few days, repeatedly pulling on it and shifting it day by day, and then it will come out. But if it will not come out after some days, you will have to drill away the bone from all round with a fine drill so as to make room for the arrow; then draw on it and pull it out.	0.84686196
If the arrow is lodged in the bone of the skull and has penetrated deep into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of the symptoms I have mentioned appear in the patient, refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until his condition becomes clear after several days.	If the arrow is buried in some part of the body and is quite lost to sight, explore for it with a probe, and if you can feel it then draw it out with any suitable instrument.	0.5371976
then attempt to pull and extract the arrow. If it is firmly lodged and does not yield to pulling, then use the perforators around the arrow as I have described to you, and then treat the area until it heals.  But if the arrow is embedded in some part of the body... and hidden from the senses, then search for it with the probe. If you feel it, pull it with some of the instruments suitable for extracting it. If you cannot do so because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vessel there...	But if you cannot get at it on account of the narrowness of the wound and the depth at which the arrow is, and there be no bone nor nerve nor blood-vessel, then cut round it until the wound be sufficiently wide to enable you to take hold of it and extract it.	0.6932355
then enlarge the wound by incising it so that you can reach the arrow and extract it. If it has barbs, grasp them and free the flesh embedded in them from every side by whatever means you can. If you are unable to free the flesh, try to break the barbs and twist them until you free them.	And if it have two barbs by which it is held, free them from the adherent flesh all round, in any way you can; or, if you cannot free the tissues, try skilfully to break off the two barbs and twist them about until the arrow comes free.	0.7248684
When you attempt to extract the arrow, wherever it may be, twist your hand with the hooks in all directions until you free it. Be extremely gentle so that the arrow does not break, making it difficult for you to pull and extract it. If you are unable to do so immediately...	Whenever you try to extract an arrow from any part, employ a twisting motion of your hand with the forceps in all directions until you free it; and use the utmost gentleness not to break the arrow and thus make it hard to draw it out and remove it.	0.87144935
then leave it for a few days until the flesh around it putrefies, then try again, for it will then be easier. If you encounter bleeding, use the treatment we mentioned in its chapter. Take great care not to cut a vessel, nerve, or tendon, and use ingenuity.	If you are unable to get it out at once then leave it for some days until the tissues that surround it putrefy, then return to it, for then the extraction will be easy; and if haemorrhage interfere use the remedies prescribed in the chapter dealing with that. Exercise the utmost care not to cut a blood-vessel or nerve or tendon; and employ the greatest skill in freeing the arrow; it should be done gently and unhurriedly and with perseverance, as I have told you.	0.81577516
By whatever means you can, extract the arrow, but do so gently, slowly, and steadily as I have described to you. When you pull the arrow, it is best to position the patient in the same way they were when the arrow struck them.	Exercise the utmost care not to cut a blood-vessel or nerve or tendon; and employ the greatest skill in freeing the arrow; it should be done gently and unhurriedly and with perseverance, as I have told you. When extracting an arrow you should place the patient in the same position he was in when the arrow struck him, for that is more convenient; but if you cannot do this then let him be in whatever position is possible for you.	0.76966834
If you cannot do this, then use whatever position you can. As for the arrow that emerges from the opposite side, either a part of it will have protruded outwards, or you will find the tip of the arrow close to the surface of the skin by feeling it and you will see it bulging.	The arrow that is to be extracted from the opposite side either has some part protruding through or else the tip of the arrow gives rise to a palpable swelling just beneath the skin and you see it sticking out; then cut down upon it; the incision should be wide enough to admit the forceps.	0.69718814
Make an incision over it, just large enough to fit the hooks, then pull it, for it will be easy to extract. If it is stuck in a bone, twist your hand in a circular motion so that the arrow affects the bone and widens the space for itself, then pull it.	Then pull on it, for the extraction of it will be easy. If it is stuck in bone, twist it round with your hand until the arrow makes an impression in the bone and opens up a way for itself; then pull it.	0.8314396
If not, leave it for a few days and then try again until it comes out. If the arrow's shaft is still attached, push on it.  If the shaft has fallen off and you wish to push it, insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the notch of the arrowhead, then push with it.	If it does not come out, let it alone for some days, and repeat until it does come out. If the arrow-shaft be in the wound, then thrust the arrow out with that. But if the shaft has fallen out, and you wish to employ thrusting, introduce down to it the hollow instrument whose cavity will enter upon the ferrule of the arrow, then push it forward with that.	0.8866202
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that fits into the hollow, as this will make the arrow easier to extract.  If the arrow is poisoned, you should excise all the flesh that the poison has reached, if possible, then treat it appropriately.	If the arrow be hollow, thrust it forward with an instrument that will enter into the cavity, for the exit of the arrow will thereby be made easy. If the arrow be poisoned you must, if you can, cut out in a circle all the flesh into which the poison has entered; then treat it with what is appropriate.	0.92106545
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side, and is close enough to be probed and you can make an incision over it, then make an incision, taking care not to cut any vein or nerve, and extract it.	If the arrow that has struck be in the chest or abdomen or in the urinary bladder or in the flank and it be close enough for you to explore it with the probe and you can cut down upon it, then do so, but beware of cutting into a blood-vessel or nerve.	0.8627282
Then suture the wound if it requires stitching, then treat it until it heals.  Image of the hooks with which arrows are extracted:.	Afterwards suture the wound, if suture be necessary, and dress it until it heals. Forceps for extracting arrows.	0.8370453
Their ends are like a bird's beak, made like a file; when they grip the arrow or something, they do not let go.  They are made in large, small, and medium sizes, all according to the size of the arrow, and the width and narrowness of the wound.	The extremities resemble the bill of a bird and are engraved like a file so as not to lose grip when you close them upon an arrow or some other object. They are made in several kinds, large, small, or medium, all according to the bigness or smallness of the arrow and the breadth or narrowness of the wound.	0.8690201
Image of the hollow pusher:.	The hollow thruster.	0.496655
Image of the solid pusher:.	The solid thruster.	0.5664481
This one has a solid end like a probe so that it easily enters the hollow arrow and pushes it.	The extremity is solid like a probe, to facilitate entry into, and pushing, the hollow arrow.	0.80128324
