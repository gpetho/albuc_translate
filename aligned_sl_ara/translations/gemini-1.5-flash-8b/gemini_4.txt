The author of this book, having completed for you, my children, this book, which is the complete portion of the science of medicine, and having reached its peak in clarity and explanation, saw fit to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of practical application.
Because practical application in our country and in our time is entirely lacking, so much so that its study has almost ceased and its effect has been cut off. But only a few traces of it remain in the books of the ancients, which the hands have corrupted, and error and confusion have affected, so that its meanings have become obscure and its benefit distant.
Therefore, I saw fit to revive it and compose this treatise on it by way of explanation, clarity, and abbreviation, and to provide images of cautery irons and other instruments of practice, since it is an addition to the explanation and an illustration of what is needed.
The reason there is no skilled practitioner with skillful hands in our time is that the craft of medicine is long, and its practitioner must first exert himself in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen. So that he may grasp the uses of the organs, their arrangement, temperaments, connections, and separations, and know the bones, nerves, and muscles, their number and exits, the pulsating and static veins, and the locations of their exits.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are numerous in name but few in deed, especially in the craft of the hand. We have mentioned a part of this in the introduction to this book.
For whoever is not knowledgeable about the anatomy we have mentioned is liable to make mistakes that kill people, as I have witnessed often among those who have pretended to this knowledge without study or understanding.
For I saw an ignorant physician who incised a swine-like tumor on a woman's neck, injuring some of the arteries of the neck, causing the woman to bleed to death before his eyes.
I saw another physician, attempting to remove a stone from an elderly man, who had a large stone, acting rashly and extracting it with a piece of the bladder tissue. The man died about three days later. I was called to remove it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the patient's condition that I could not have done it.
I saw another physician who earned a living practicing medicine among the merchants of our town.
A black boy, who had a fracture in his leg near the heel, with a wound, came to him. The physician, in his ignorance, hastily applied splints and bandages tightly to the fracture, over the wound, leaving no breathing space for the wound.
Then he indulged his desires, and left him for days, instructing him not to loosen the bandages until his leg and foot were swollen and he was close to death.
I was summoned to him, and I quickly loosened the bandages. He found relief and his pain lessened, but the damage to the limb had already taken hold and I could not prevent it.
The damage continued to progress in the limb until he died.
I saw another physician treat a malignant tumor. After a few days, it ulcerated, and the patient's condition worsened.  This is because, if the cancer is purely a black humor, it should never be treated with iron.
Unless it is in a limb that can be completely removed.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work can be divided into two categories: work that is accompanied by safety, and work that, in most cases, leads to injury.
I have warned throughout this book of any work that involves risk and fear, and you should avoid and reject it.
So that the ignorant may not have an opportunity to speak ill or find fault, take care, exercise caution, and treat your patients gently and with certainty.
Use the best path leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure illnesses.
Keep yourselves away from that which you fear might lead to doubt in your religion and worldly affairs, for this will be more lasting for your reputation and elevate your standing in this world and the next.
Galen, in some of his precepts, said: "Do not treat a disease badly, and thus you shall be known as bad physicians.
This article is divided into three chapters.
The first chapter.
In cauterization by fire and cauterization by a sharp medicine, a categorized treatise from the heel to the foot, descriptions of instruments, cautery irons, and everything necessary for manual work.
The second chapter.
On incision, lancing, bloodletting, cupping, surgeries, removal of arrows, and similar procedures, categorized and arranged, and depictions of the instruments.
The third chapter.
On fractures, dislocations, treatment of sprains, and similar conditions, categorized and arranged from the heel to the foot, and depictions of the instruments.
The first chapter.
On cauterization.
Before we describe the procedure, it is necessary to mention the benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
To say that the benefits and harms of cauterization are a lengthy discussion, a precise science, and a hidden secret, many wise men have spoken about it.
And they differed, but I have summarized their brief statements, fearing to be overly lengthy.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for every bad temperament, with or without matter, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without matter, and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they differed. Some said that cauterization is beneficial in it, while others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for a disease caused by heat and dryness because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to be cured of a hot, dry disease with a hot, dry remedy.  The one who says the opposite says that cauterization with fire may benefit from a hot, dry disease occurring in people's bodies. Because when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the human body cold.
And I say as he says, because experience has revealed that to me many times, but one should not conceive of this matter except those who have diligently practiced and trained in the art of cauterization extensively. And he who stands on the differences in the temperaments of people, and the nature of diseases within themselves, their causes, symptoms and duration.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear of them, especially cold, moist diseases.  All physicians agree on this, and they do not differ in the benefit of cauterization in them.
Know, my children, that the secret of cauterization with fire, and its superiority over cauterization with a burning medicine, lies in this: fire is a single element whose effect is confined to the organ cauterized, and it does not harm another connected organ except with a minor harm.
Cauterization with burning medicine may extend its effect to other organs, and it may possibly create a disease in the organ that is difficult to treat, and may even kill.  Fire, because of its noble and esteemed essence, will not do this unless it is excessive.
This has become clear to us through experience, due to the length of service and care in the craft, and through the understanding of the facts of the matter.
Therefore, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse.  Had it not been unbefitting this book of mine, I would have presented to you the secret and manner of fire's action on the body, and its eradication of diseases, using a philosophical and demonstrative argument that would be too subtle for your comprehension.
Know, my children, that they have differed regarding the time when cauterization is most suitable, and have declared the best time to be spring.
I say that cauterization may be suitable in any season, for the harm caused by the season is outweighed by the benefit that cauterization brings. Especially if the cauterization is for a strong, urgent, and serious ailment, which cannot tolerate delay, because a greater calamity might follow than the slight harm caused by the season.
Do not, my children, think what the general public and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization which cures a disease will never return and thereby becomes a blemish.
And it is not as you suppose, because cauterization is like a medicine that changes the temperament and dries out the moisture, which is the cause of the ailments.
However, cauterization is superior to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.
The disease may return at some time in the future, depending on the patient's temperament, the strength and severity of the illness, the gathering of humors in the body, and the patient's negligence in acquiring proper nourishment and similar causes.
Unless the disease for which cauterization is used is a mild one, in a part of the body with few humors and moisture. For example, cauterizing a tooth for pain and similar conditions, the pain may not return, and this will be the least of the possibilities.
Also, the common saying that cauterization is the last resort in medicine is correct, not in the way they think, because they believe that no treatment will help after cauterization, and the matter is otherwise.
The meaning of "cauterization is the last resort in medicine" is that when various treatments have been applied to a disease without success, and then cauterization is used as the final measure and is successful, *then* cauterization is considered the last resort. Not in the sense understood by the common people and many ignorant physicians.
The ancients stated that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, saying this because of gold's moderation and noble nature. They said that the cauterized area does not become inflamed, but this is not universally true.
Because I have experienced it, and found that it works in some bodies but not others. Cauterization with gold is better than with iron, as they said, except that if you heat a gold cautery in the fire, you cannot determine when it is heated to the desired degree of gold's redness.
Because cold quickly affects it, and if you increase its heat in a fever, it melts in the fire and becomes molten, thus causing the craftsman to be occupied.  Therefore, cauterization with iron is faster and closer to correctness for practical use, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections, ordered from head to foot, to make it easier for the student to understand, God willing.
The First Chapter.
In cauterization of the head, a single cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for excessive moisture and coldness in the brain, which are the causes of headaches, frequent colds from the head to the eyes and ears, excessive sleepiness, toothache, and sore throats. And generally, for any illness caused by coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and lethargy, and similar ailments.
The method for this cauterization is to first order the patient to induce vomiting with a purgative that clears the head for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and habits.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor, then have him sit before you, squatting, with his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes.  Wherever your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive oil cautery, which is of this form.
If the bone is exposed to the extent of a bodkin head or a carbuncle, lift your hand. Otherwise, reheat your hand with the same iron, or with another, if it has cooled. Until you see the bone as I described, then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a piece of cotton in it. Place it on the area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a piece of cotton soaked in ghee and leave it until the heat from the cautery subsides.  Then treat it with the four-fold ointment until it heals, God willing.
They say that a wound that remains open prolongs the pus, which is better and more beneficial.
Some have said to cauterize the skin to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the bone's thickness burns. Then, to remove the burnt bone, and then to treat.
Others said that one should exaggerate the cauterization so that it strongly affects the bone, causing it to fall off like a carat or a small coin.  They claimed that this releases the vapors of the head from that spot, and that the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then treat until it heals. I do not find these two types of cauterization at all beneficial except in some individuals, and by way of chance.  I prefer to leave them alone, and with safety, if it be true, as the head weakens when its natural connections are disrupted as we have seen in other limbs.
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is safer and better in my view. Use it, and you will be safe, God willing.
The Second Chapter.
On cauterizing the head as well.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head, and this persists in the patient, and if the applications, poultices, flogging, ointments, and bandages have been used, and especially if the single cauterization we described did not help, then examine. If the patient's head is strong by nature, and not weak, and if he experiences severe cold, cauterize another small area above that one. Then cauterize each horn of his head with a cauterization until the thickness of the skin is gone and the bone is revealed to the extent we have described. And cauterize a spot at the back of his head, in the area known as the "axe" [or "the place where the axe lies"]. Be gentle here and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience intense pain unlike the pain of all other head cauterizations. I will mention this cauterization in its proper place.
The cauterizing instrument used for the horns and back of the head should be gentler than the one used for the middle of the head. This is its form/image.
Chapter Three.
Cauterization of the chronic sister.
If, in the cleft of the head, pain occurs with headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then have the patient purge with medicines that purify the head, and use all other treatment mentioned in the classifications of diseases. If this is not effective, then cauterization in this case is twofold. Either by cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
As for cauterization with the burning medicine, one takes a single clove of garlic, peels it, and cuts its ends off both sides. Then, with a wide scalpel, incise the painful area of the temple until there is a subcutaneous space large enough to accommodate the clove.
Then, insert it under the skin until it disappears.  Then, press firmly on it with a firm pressure. Leave it for about fifteen hours, then remove it and take out the garlic. Leave the wound for two or three days, then bandage it.
Place a cotton swab dipped in ghee on it, until the area becomes suppurative.  Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.  If you prefer, you may use some of the burning medicines which I have given in the 18th article on burning medicines.
As for cauterizing with iron, it is done in this manner: heat the cautery iron, which is depicted as follows:
It is called the nail-headed cautery because its head resembles a nail, with some serrations on it, and a small protuberance in the middle.
Then, place it on the painful area, and hold your hand while slowly rotating the iron, burning the skin to about half its thickness. And lift your hand so you do not burn the vein underneath and cause bleeding; then soak a cotton swab in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. Then, treat it with ointment by applying it to the cotton swab until healed, God willing.
If you wish, cauterize this vein with the sharp, knife-like part of the cautery, preserving it from cutting the vein in this chronic vein, especially.
Chapter Four.
Cauterizing the chronic vein.
If you have treated the vein using the aforementioned treatments and what we have mentioned in the classifications of diseases, and the treatment has not been successful, and you see a cause beyond what we have described, such as initial cauterization with medicine or cauterization by fire, do not proceed. You should heat the knife-like cautery until it whitens, after having marked the painful area with a line about half a finger long or similar.  Hold your hand once, pulling it firmly until the vein is cut and reaches the bone.
However, you should be cautious not to touch the jaw that moves during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or nerve controlling it, causing spasms.
Be cautious and vigilant about the bleeding of the artery you cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially if one does not know what to do and has not had prior successful experience; abandoning the procedure is preferable.
The treatment of accidental bleeding from an artery will be discussed in its proper place in the book, God willing, if you find a condition that this cauterization cannot handle.
If you find the patient's body able to withstand it, cauterize the center of the head as described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, use the cauterization we mentioned in the chapter on cutting an artery with the two-bladed cauterizing iron; it is a better and more effective cauterization than this one.
Chapter Five.
On cauterizing earaches.
If an earache occurs due to cold and is treated with laxatives and other treatments we have mentioned in the classification, but the pain does not subside, then heat the cauterizing iron, which is called the dot, which is its image.
Then, after heating it, apply it to the entire ear, moving it around, or around both ears if the pain is in both. Move the cauterization away slightly from the base of the ear after marking the location with ink. The cauterization should be about ten dots on each ear, or thereabouts. Then treat the locations until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Six.
In cauterizing the fistula.
The fistula that is treated by cauterization is the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
One should avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve tension.
When you have treated this type of fistula with irrigation, massage, and gargles, and your treatment has not been successful, then the affected area should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area, because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization should be made with one cauterization opposite the upper part of the ear, slightly below the crown of the head, and another in the temple, its length equal to the length of the thumb.
With the cauterization, apply your hand until you burn about half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cautery, which is a type of knife, but slightly gentler, as you can see. The knife should have a slight excess of thickness, then treat the area as previously described until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On cauterization of chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and you treat it as we have described, and your treatment is unsuccessful and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize four times. One cauterization on each temple, one cauterization in the center of the head as previously mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head, as previously described.
The cautery treatment, as previously mentioned.  A cauterization may also be applied to the mouth of the stomach, which would be more effective; then treat as previously described.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for forgetfulness.
One afflicted with phlegm should first be given large doses of laxatives and purgatives to clear the brain.
Then, shave his entire head and apply a mustard poultice, as described in the chapter on dressings, several times.  For it is a form of cautery.
And do this in the same manner as previously mentioned. If he recovers thereby, do not proceed further; otherwise, cauterize him three times on the back of his head, in a row, from the top of his head to the base of his neck.
Leave the thickness of a finger between each cauterization, and then treat the cauterization as previously described.  If you wish to increase the treatment, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle one.
If you wish to increase the treatment, cauterize on the temples, then treat him until he is healed.  The cauterizing instrument should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterization for paralysis and general relaxation of the body.
First, cleanse the head with the applications we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head, and cauterize one cautery in the center of the head and one on each temple and one on the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck. If, in a case of general relaxation of the body, more than this is required, and the patient can tolerate it and the illness is severe and stubborn, cauterize four cauteries on the vertebrae of his back. Cauterize deeply enough to burn most of the skin, then lift your hand and treat him as previously described until he is healed, God willing. The cautery should be olive-oil based.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterization for epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is due to phlegm should be cauterized.  First, his brain should be cleansed with large leeches and with all the other treatments we have described in the section, if the patient is strong and can tolerate taking the medications.
However, if he is a child who cannot tolerate medications, then for many days before, use gargles and mouthwashes that cleanse the brain, while also improving his diet.
Then shave his head, then cauterize with a single cauterization in the middle of the head, as described earlier, and another cauterization in his back. And on each temple, one cauterization. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize with the cauterizations mentioned in the discussion of paralysis and relaxation of the body on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, using an olive-oil cautery, in the manner previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this way.
Chapter Eleven.
In the cauterization of melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is putrid moisture and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauterizations that we mentioned in the case of paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess leaning towards black bile and the patient's body is moist and corrupt, purge what cleanses the brain as described in the division.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of flax like a circle, then place it in the center of his head, and the patient sits crouched, holding it from each side. Then take one pound of old sheep's butter.
Then heat it over a moderate fire until a finger can tolerate it when inserted, then pour it into the center of his head in the circle. Leave it until it cools.  Do this to the patient once a week along with his other good treatment until he is healed, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small, scattered punctures, without holding the cautery in your hand, but rather with a gentle touching.  This type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cotton pad soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter twelve.
On cauterizing water descending into the eye.
If you observe the descending water in the eye, by the signs mentioned in the classification, immediately treat the afflicted person.  Cleanse his head and protect it from all moisture.  Make him sweat in a bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize with a cautery in the middle of the head. Then cauterize twice on the temples, if the water is descending into both eyes, or if it is descending into one eye, cauterize on the temple of that side.
Then, using the cautery, cut all the veins and arteries under the skin.  Let the cauterizations be in the length and width of the temples, and be careful to prevent bleeding.
If you see anything of it, cut it at the appropriate place using whatever treatment is possible.  We will discuss the wisdom of dissecting and cutting arteries, and preventing bleeding.
One may also cauterize twice deeply on the back of the neck, under the bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the cauterization of chronic weeping sores.
If the eye's weeping is chronic and constant, and originates from veins and arteries on the surface of the head from outside the head, and you are certain that it is due to thick, cold, phlegmatic excess, cauterize it with the cauterization I described at the beginning of the descending water. One cauterization in the middle of the head, two on the temples, and two on the back of the neck beneath the bones. If more is needed, cauterize on each side of the eye's tear duct at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing a foul-smelling nose.
If treatment with what we mentioned in the classification was unsuccessful, promptly cauterize the patient's sinuses for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle area with an olive oil cautery iron. Then cauterize with a nail-shaped cautery iron, two cauterizations above the eyebrows, slightly beneath the hair, and be cautious of the artery, do not sever it. This is a depiction of the nail-shaped cautery iron.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid is relaxed due to disease or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize slightly above the eyebrows, two cauterizations in each direction, spaced from the temples, and the length of each cauterization should be equal to the length of the eyebrow.
Do not overdo the cauterization with your hand, but only to the point where one-third of the skin is burned.  And the shape of the cautery iron should be of this type.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If the eyelashes turn inward and injure the eye, cauterization in this case is of two types. Either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.  As for cauterization with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to allow the eyelashes to grow long and even if they are the type who pluck them.
If it is hurting when they are growing, bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so they don't move until they grow.  Once they have grown and are even, place the patient's head on your lap, then mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of a leaf.
Begin the mark near the eyelashes, then place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a basilisk under the eyelid.  Then heat an iron; this is its form.
Then cauterize it little by little in many applications, until the surface of the skin which is in the shape of the entire herb leaf is burned.  A sign of correct work is to see the eyelid has shrunken, and the hairs have risen from the eye's flesh.
Then remove your hand and leave it for three days, then apply a cotton pad with ghee until the scab is removed. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If any hair grows back after a while and the eyelid relaxes,
Then repeat the cauterization at that spot as you did at first. If the hair is on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with a burning medicine, you order the patient to let the eyelashes grow long and even.
Then make a shape of an asafoetida leaf from paper, then take from the usual soap and quicklime, one dirham or similar weight of each, grind them thoroughly together, doing this quickly so that they do not dry. Then spread it out on the paper in the shape of the asafoetida leaf, and place it on the single or both eyelids. Place a cotton pad soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on the medicine and gently press it, moving it whenever the patient feels the burning of the medicine, because he finds a burning sensation like fire.  As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger.  Once the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And observe; if you see the eyelid has risen as it rises from cauterization by fire or cutting, then do otherwise, and reapply the medicine to the part where it has not taken effect and has not blackened, until you complete your work and the eye is cauterized. Then apply cotton with oil until the burning subsides.
Then treat it with palm ointment or similar until it heals.  You must be extremely careful during treatment that no medicine falls into the eye.  If the eyelid loosens after a few days and we fear there is something in the eye (referring to hair or debris).
Then reapply the medicine to the loosened part of the eyelid, specifically as you did at first, and treat it until it heals.  This is a picture of an asafoetida leaf.
Know that people's eyes vary in size and age, therefore adjust your cauterization accordingly.  The correct method is not hidden from those who have expertise in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
Cauterizing the fistula that appears in the eye's margin.
If you have treated the fistula with the methods described in the sections on diseases, and your treatment is ineffective, it is then necessary to cauterize it in this manner.
Order the patient to place his head on your lap, and have an attendant hold it firmly, preventing any movement or shaking of the head.
Then place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or the juice of a *barzquṭūn* (likely a specific plant) on their eyes.  Then heat the cautery iron, which is pictured in this way.
It should be hollowed out, like a bird of prey's feather tube, on the side where the cauterization will be done.  If you prefer, the other end can be pierced or solid like a rod; however, the hollowed one is better for your work, God willing.
Then, if the fistula is open, squeeze out the matter and dry it; or if it is not open, open it and remove the pus.  Then apply the extremely hot cautery iron to it, holding it until you reach the bone.
Keep your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose when cauterizing, so that your hand doesn't miss or the patient doesn't become distressed, and the cautery iron doesn't land on the eyelid and damage it. If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, then stop; otherwise, reheat the cautery iron a second time if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball with ghee and treat it with the dried ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, apply the strong, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed, and treat it as described in the appropriate section, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing a fistula, mentioned by some earlier authorities, is to carefully cut into the fistula, then place a thin cone, shaped like this, into the opening.
Pour in molten lead weighing approximately one dirham, and hold the cone firmly and steadily in place, ensuring the patient remains completely still so that the molten lead does not flow into their eye.  You should place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
The lead will burn the fistula and heal it remarkably. If the fistula heals with the described cauterization and treatment, then it is sufficient. Otherwise, it will be necessary to use nasal cauterization to return the fistula to its proper nasal passage, as will be detailed later in the appropriate section.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing a cleft lip.
A cleft in the lip, known as a fissure, often occurs, especially in the lips of young boys.  If the cleft is treated as described in the division but the treatment proves ineffective, then use a small, knife-like cautery iron, as illustrated.
Make its cavity as thin as a knife's edge, then apply it hot and quickly to the cleft itself, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the fissure.  Then treat it with the qirrotti until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing a fistula in the mouth.
If a tumor appears at the base of the gums, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, and then ulcerates and bursts, forming a fistula from the discharge of pus, and treatment proves ineffective, then a cautery iron should be heated to a size suitable for the fistula.
Then insert it hot into the hole of the fistula, and hold it until the heated iron reaches its depths and its end. Do this once or twice, then treat it afterward with the treatment we mentioned until it heals, God willing.
If the matter is cut off and heals, otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what will be described in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On loose teeth and gums.
If the gums are loosened by moisture and the teeth are moving, and treatment with medicine is ineffective, place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery, whose image will come after this, after placing the tube on the tooth.
And insert the hot cautery quickly, and hold your hand for a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then lift your hand, and then repeat the cautery several times as desired, then the patient fills his mouth with salt water.
He holds it for an hour and spits it out.  Then the loose tooth will become firm, and the relaxed gums will tighten, and the bad moisture will dry up.
The Twenty-first Chapter.
On cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is caused by cold or worms, and treatment with medicine has not been effective, cauterization can be done in two ways: either with oil or with fire.
As for cauterization with oil, take cow's butter and boil it in an iron ladle or a shell.  Then take a cotton ball, wrap it around the end of a rod, dip it in the hot oil, and quickly place it on the aching tooth. Hold it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. Or, if you prefer, dip wool or a cotton ball in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, then place the heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the base of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, use a copper or iron tube, somewhat thick-walled so the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.  Then heat the cautery iron, place it on the same tooth, and hold it until the iron cools.  Repeat this several times.
The pain will disappear either that day or the next.  After the cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.  This is the shape of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you prefer, as is appropriate.  This is the shape of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing swine.
If swine are affected by phlegm and cold humors, and are not yielding to maturation with medications, and you desire rapid maturation, then heat the hollow cautery, the image of which is shown, having both ends pierced.
To expel the smoke during the cauterization from the other end, place it, protected, on the same tumor, once and again if needed, until it reaches the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, then make the cautery the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton swab dipped in clarified butter to remove what has been burned by the fire. Then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If humidity predominates in the trachea, especially if accompanied by a cold temperament, the patient should first be purged with laxative medicines, then cauterized with a cautery on the notch of the neck at the base of the throat, in the low-lying area.
Be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery and burn only half of the skin.  Then cauterize again at the joint of the neck, at the end of the pearl of it, with a strong cautery.  Let the cautery be an iron one, in the manner previously described.
Then treat him with what was previously mentioned until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterizing lung disease and coughing.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold moisture, and the patient does not have a fever or consumption, and the illness is chronic, cauterize twice above the collarbones in the soft, empty, low-lying areas, and once more in the center of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be in the form of a nail, as previously described.  If you prefer, the cauterization may be by dripping with the cautery known as the *naqṭa*. Its form has been previously described in the treatment of ear pain.  The number of drops should be from thirty to a similar number.
Then treat him with what was mentioned previously until he is cured.  A cautery with three branches, shaped as described, may also be used. This type of cautery should be employed quickly, as it allows for three cauterizations in one application. This is the form of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus dislocates due to slippery moisture, or if, when replacing it, it does not remain fixed, so that it repeatedly dislocates upon the slightest movement, as we have observed, then the condyle must be reduced first. Then the patient lies on their back or on their right side, and the skin inside the armpit is lifted upward with the fingers of the left hand if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then the double-bladed cautery, whose image is this, is heated.
Then, with it, the skin is cauterized until it penetrates to the other side. The cauterization mark will be four cauterizations.  A three-bladed cautery may be used, in which case the cauterization mark will be six cauterizations; the blades will be of the sharpness of the cut.
This is the image of the three-bladed cautery.
Sometimes one more cauterization is added, making eight in total.  Then, crushed balls mixed with salt are applied to the cauterization.  The patient must rest and not move the limb for a time, until it strengthens.  If the dislocation is upward, this is rare.
Cauterize above the shoulder blade with one good, nail-like cauterization, or many small, dotted cauterizations. The joint will strengthen, the moisture will be expelled, and the patient will recover.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If a cold and excessive moisture develops in the stomach, upsetting its temperament, and frequent discharges occur despite various treatments proving ineffective, the patient should lie on their back, extending their legs and arms, and then be cauterized three times. Cauterize below the breastbone, to the extent of a finger, with a nail-like cautery iron.  Apply two more cauterizations below and slightly off the sides of the first cauterization to create a triangular shape.  Space them sufficiently apart to prevent coalescence should they become suppurated. The depth of the cauterization should be about two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and the cauterizations should form a triangular shape.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cautery in the center of the stomach, in this manner.
The cautery iron used for this single cauterization should be circular, in this manner.
The stomach may also be cauterized by puncturing.  For those who fear the large cauterization, mark the stomach with points of the desired size using ink, then cauterize them with a pointed cautery iron, and subsequently treat with the previously described remedy until healed.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
Concerning the cauterization of the cold liver.
If the liver presents pain due to coldness and dampness, or due to a violent wind, such that it has departed from its natural disposition to an excessive degree, and the patient has been treated as described in the classification but to no avail. The patient should lie on their back, and three cauteries of this shape and size should be applied to the liver, below the collarbones, where a person's arm ends.
After each cauterization, a space the thickness of a finger should be left. The cauterization should be along the body, straight, and do not hold the cauterizing iron tightly.
The burn should be about half the thickness of the skin, no more. The patient should be standing on their feet, or if unable to stand, lying with legs extended and arms raised. This is the shape of the cautery iron.
You may use a knife-shaped cautery iron for these cauterizations if you have skill and care in the craft, being careful not to extend the cauterization too far, as this will burn all the skin, causing burns to the abdomen and reaching the intestines, as the skin there is thin.  Know this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
Cauterization of a liver tumor.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know whether the tumor is in the liver's flesh or its membrane, if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient will experience heaviness and pain without intensity.
And if it is in the liver's membrane, the pain will be accompanied by intense severity.  If the physicians have exhausted their treatment, the patient should lie on their back, and the inflamed area should be marked with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire, the cautery which resembles a hoe, and this is its image. Cauterize it with a single cauterization, until all the skin is burned and the cauterization reaches the membrane, so that all the pus comes out. Then treat it with abscess treatments until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be performed by those who have extensive experience in medicine, and whose hands have repeatedly dealt with such illnesses through experience.  Only then should they undertake such a procedure; to leave it to me is preferable.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients recommended cauterizing a cold fistula with the roots of the zarawand plant.  Take a single, long, dried root of zarawand, as thick as a finger, and dip it in oil.  Then hold it in the fire. Then cauterize once between the collarbone and the neck, and two small cauterizations a little below the blood vessels, angled towards the area under the chin.  And two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, angled slightly backward.  Another cauterization in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.  Three cauterizations from behind, one between the shoulders, and two on either side of the flank, below the cauterization between the collarbones.
One should not penetrate deeply with the cautery, but rather apply it superficially to the skin, as a smoldering action. Some of the ancients noted that some people used a flat iron-like cautery, heating it, and then inserting it between the ribs until reaching the tumor itself.
The pus will drain as described in the case of a liver tumor, and in this type of abscess, cauterization carries a risk; either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops in the area, with no cure.
Chapter Thirty.
In cauterizing the spleen.
If treatment of spleen disease, as described in the classifications, proves ineffective, cauterization may be employed in three ways, all correct: one is to cauterize three or four times in a line along the spleen.
In the form of liver cauterization described previously, with a space between each cauterization equal to or slightly exceeding the thickness of a finger.  Use the same cautery as described for liver cauterization, and do not insert the cautery deeply.  The patient should be lying on their back.
The other method is at the elbow. Lift the skin opposite the spleen, where the patient's left elbow ends. Raise the skin across the width of the body so the cauterizations are lengthwise.
Then, insert the cautery tips, very carefully, until they pierce the skin on the other side, then remove the cautery.  The cauterizations will be four in number, and if desired, use the three-pronged cautery.
Then, treat the cauterized area after allowing it to discharge pus for several days. This is more effective than any previous treatment.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization is beneficial in dropsy of the abdomen, specifically. If you have treated the patient with the various treatments we described in the classification and your treatment is ineffective, you should cauterize four times around the navel and once on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, one on the spleen, and two behind his back, one opposite his chest and the other opposite his stomach.  The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin. Then, leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
Do not neglect the patient with further treatment after the cauterization, as is necessary to gather the necessary elements for a speedy recovery. The shape of the cauterizing iron used for the back is pointed, as previously described, and the one used for the chest is olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they (the feet) swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the back of the foot at the point between the little toe and the ring finger.
Hold your hand with the cauterizing iron straight, do not bend it, and then lift your hand and do not return it; the yellow water will drain out, and the cauterizing iron should be of this shape.
Then cauterize the legs twice on each leg.  The cauterization should be done with the sharp end of the cauterizing iron, along the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other below that, towards the middle of the leg.  And cauterize each thigh twice, twice on each.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, allowing the water to drain out, then treat it with the other methods we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On cauterizing dysentery.
If the dysentery is due to cold and dampness, weakening the binding and digestive powers of the stomach and intestines, and if other treatments have failed to cure it, and you see the patient strong enough to endure cauterization, then cauterize a large area on their stomach. As previously mentioned, cauterize the stomach with a circular cautery iron. Apply four cauteries around the navel using a fine nail cautery iron.  Apply one or two large cauteries to the cotton on the coccyx.
If you see a considerable amount of dampness and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize a spot on the pubic region and a spot on each hip; and possibly add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach. This is an effective treatment, whose benefit will not fail, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If, in the anus, there are numerous chronic hemorrhoids, or a single one, composed of thick, cold humors or corrupted moisture, and the treatment mentioned in the previous section was ineffective, cauterize the patient with three triangular cauteries on the lower part of the spine, slightly below the table.
And cauterize a spot under the navel the size of two fingers.  If you judge that the patient's stomach is cold, and their food is not digesting, and you see their face swollen, cauterize a large spot on the stomach as previously described, and cauterize a spot on the liver. And another on the spleen with a nail-shaped cautery. Leave the cautery open for a time, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery that resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the same cut wart and exert pressure until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which the blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as described, then treat them with suitable ointments until they heal.  If a large cauterization is applied to the cotton, it will be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On cauterizing fistula in the anus and surrounding areas.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and procedure described in its place, and avoids it, cauterization might provide a cure. If someone has a fistula that has existed for a long time, and pus and foul humours are flowing from it, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then determine its depth with the probe, then heat the cautery, which resembles a spatula, and insert it hot into the fistula along the same path and to the depth that the probe reached. Repeat the cauterization until all the corrupted tissues are burned, once, twice, or three times, as needed.
Be cautious about burning a nerve, if there is one, or a large vein, if the fistula opens into the bladder or into the gut.
Take precautions from all these locations, and only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area, and you judge that it is not penetrating. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area seals up, and the discharges cease, and it remains like that for a time, then know that it has healed completely.
If the discharges do not stop, know that it is penetrating or has a corrupted bone in its depth, or something similar to what will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On the cauterization of the kidney.
If pain occurs in the kidney from cold or thick wind, and the patient's sexual potency is diminished as a result, it is necessary to cauterize the loins, specifically each kidney, with the nail cauterizer previously mentioned.  Perhaps we cauterize three times on the same area, creating three aligned cauterizations for a greater benefit.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot hold his urine, cauterize once below the navel on the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and cauterize again to the right of the navel, and another to the left.
After the cauterization on each side, make a cauterization the size of a thumb's breadth below the back, or two cauterizations if needed.  The cauterizing tool should be a nail cauterizer, as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
On the cauterization of the uterus.
If the uterus has accumulated cold and dampness, preventing conception, corrupting its form, or causing pain during delivery, three cauterizations should be made around the navel, as described in the cauterization of the bladder. A cauterization on the cotton below the back, or two, using a nail cautery.
Chapter Forty.
On the cauterization of a dislocated hip.
Erroneous humors may accumulate in the hip joint, causing dislocation.  A sign is the lengthening of one leg compared to the other when the legs are aligned, and a gap will be found at the site of the dislocation.  A roughly circular cauterization should be applied to the affected area of the hip joint itself.
After applying the cauterization around the joint, as if a circle were drawn, so that the joint itself is in the center of the circle.  Use the cautery shown as an example for cauterizing the stomach.  If this cautery is not available, cauterize with three cauterizations using a large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cauterization deep enough to reach all layers of skin, then treat until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-one.
In cauterizing the sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and dampness, and the treatment mentioned in the classification was ineffective and prolonged, then the patient should be relieved of the thick humours with rotten seeds or prickly pear seeds, or similar ones.
Then cauterize.  Cauterization has two types: either with burning medicines or with fire. Cauterization with fire can be done in many ways. One of them is to cauterize the hip joint itself three times in a triangular pattern like this.
This will create a beneficial depth, with a space equal to the thickness of a finger between each cauterization. The cautery should be olive-colored.  A cauterization could be made in the center, on the head of the hip itself, resulting in four cauterizations.  Or, if you wish, cauterize with the circular motion previously mentioned in the treatment of hip dislocation, using one cauterization.
So that the circle surrounds the entire hip and burns the whole thickness of the skin.  This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize the thigh twice in the area where the patient indicates pain, and cauterize once above the heel, about four fingers to the outer side. The cautery should be a sharp one, and the depth of the cauterization should only be the thickness of the skin.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize where he indicates with the pinpoint cautery three, four, or more times, if necessary. If he indicates pain below the knee toward the leg, cauterize there with one sharp cauterization.
Be careful in all your cauterizations not to cauterize to the point of burning a major nerve or artery, lest you inflict a serious injury or a prolonged affliction upon the patient.
I have seen one and another who cauterized above the heel and overused the cautery, causing the leg to swell until the swelling reached the foot and the whole foot became perforated and the entire leg decayed.  Then diarrhea and death followed.  If the pain is in both areas, cauterize them in exactly the same way.
Some wise scholars have mentioned a hip cauterization with these characteristics:  A cup-like device is made of iron, with a diameter of half a cubit. Its opening has the thickness of a date pit or slightly less. Inside this cup is another cup, and a third.
The distance between each cup should be the width of a thumb. The cups are open on both sides and their height is about one or two thumbs. A handle of iron is firmly attached to the cups. This is its form.
Then it is heated in the fire until it is red-hot and throws off sparks.  Then it is placed on the affected hip, and the patient is lying on their sound side.  Three circular cauterizations are made at once. Then, the patient is left for three days, bandaged with ghee, and the wound is left open for several days.
Then it is treated with ointment until it heals.  The author of this book said that this type of cautery is rarely used because of its unpleasantness and horrifying appearance, and few can endure it.  However, it is a good cautery for those who can endure it, and who are afflicted in that location.
As for cauterization with burning medicines, one makes two cups resembling the rings in which the hinges of a door are inserted, of bronze or iron.
They will have a height of about two thumbs, and the distance between them will be the thickness of a finger. The bottom and top will be open, and they will be joined together in this manner.
Then place them on the affected hip, with the patient lying on their healthy side.  Hold your hand gently, then pour a little hot, sharp water between the circles.  Hold it for the length of an hour glass. The patient must endure the burning and stinging, as it will feel like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then remove the instrument and wipe the affected hip with fresh water.  Leave it for three days and apply oil to it until the blackness of the burn disappears. Leave it for a number of days, allowing the pus to drain.  This is most beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.  If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it to hold the water, similar to what was done with the hip. This is the description of the sharp water.  I have demonstrated it in my treatise on the preparation of medicines.
Take one part each of potash and quicklime, grind them, and place them in a new pot with a single small hole at the bottom, just large enough for a rod to fit in. Place another glazed pot underneath the bottom of the first pot.
Pour fresh water over the potash and lime until it covers them by a finger's breadth, after you have thoroughly squeezed them with your hand. Leave the pot until the sharp water drips into the glazed pot below. Then collect all this water and pour it over fresh lime and potash.
It will then be extremely potent, effective in many medical procedures and cauterizing other parts of the body, as it acts like fire itself. Some medications can also cauterize the hip, such as safas, baladi honey, and lime mixed with soap, ground.
Galen recounted a story about an ancient physician treating hip and sciatica pain, greatly praising his method, claiming it required no other treatment and cured the condition in a single application.
Even, perhaps, a patient would be carried into the bath and emerge cured.  To obtain this remedy, take fresh green shiitrakh, or if fresh green isn't available, then take fresh dry shiitrakh. Grind it with some fat and apply it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg or thigh.
Apply the compress and leave it on for three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning sensation subside. Then have them enter the bath.  When their body is damp, place them in a basin. The pain will disappear and the patient will be cured, God willing. If not cured, reapply the dressing after ten days.
He will be cured, God willing.  Know that no one should use these cauterizing remedies unless the body has emptied itself. Dioscorides mentioned that goat dung, when used for cauterizing sciatica, is beneficial.
The cauterization should be done in this way: take wool and soak it in old oil. Place it on the deep area between the thumb and the elbow, closer to the elbow. Then, take dry goat dung.
Then ignite it with fire until it becomes embers, then place it on the wool and leave it until it dies out.  Repeat this process until the sensation extends from the middle of the upper arm to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called cauterization with goat dung.
Chapter Forty-two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Pain in the back may arise from numerous causes, such as a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and similar occurrences. It may be due to the accumulation of cold, moist material.  Cauterization is applicable only in this type of case.
After the patient has vomited, and has been treated with substances like rotten herbs, the back should be cauterized where the pain is located, using three rows, the width of the table.  Each row should have five cauterizations, or more, as much as the patient's tolerance and strength allows.  First, mark the area with ink.
The cauterization should be done with a point cautery.  Alternatively, three or four cauterizations can be made using a medium-sized nail cautery, in this manner.
Chapter Forty-three.
On cauterizing the initial swelling.
This ailment often affects young children.  A sign of its initial stage in a child is shortness of breath when standing or moving, and at the end of the spine's vertebrae, a prominent bead will appear, protruding above the other beads.
If you see this and wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery, like this. Cauterize each side of the vertebra evenly.  If you wish, cauterize it around the vertebra with a pinpoint cautery in two or three rows, keeping the points close together.  Then treat the affected area until it is healed as described.
Beware that cauterization should be used for swellings arising from nerve spasms.
Chapter Forty-four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are caused by cold dampness flowing to any part of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, physicians commonly call it gout, especially.
If the cold gouty cause is treated with the methods we have described in the classification, but the pain does not go away, then cauterization will relieve it.  Cauterize the area around the joints of the legs with many cauterizations after emesis. The cautery should be olive-oil based, of moderate strength, in this manner.
And if you need to cauterize spots on the leg, use a pointed cautery. If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, which often happens, cauterize each knee with three or four cauterizations on each side using the same olive-oil based cautery.
If more cauterization is needed, then cauterize, but do not make the cauterization too deep. The cauterization should only be about the thickness of the skin.  If the pain ascends to the hips or back, use the cauterization methods described in its section.
If the pain is only in the hands, cauterize around the wrists in a row on both sides. If the pain persists in the fingers, cauterize a spot on each knuckle and on the palm of the hand. If, after a few days, the pain ascends to the elbows or shoulders,
Cauterize both of them [the elbows or shoulders] on every side.  The patient should not neglect good treatment and taking medicines.  If the diet is improved and the phlegm is expelled, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the cauterization of hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, and some of the intestines and fat have descended to the testicle, and this is a recent onset, then the patient should be instructed to refrain from eating that day, and to use laxatives to evacuate the bowels.
Then he should lie on his back before you, and you should instruct him to hold himself until the fat or intestines emerge. Then you should push them back with your finger.  Then mark with ink under the hernia, on the pubic bone, a mark resembling a semicircle, its ends towards the upper body.
Then heat a cautery, its form is this.
Until it becomes white and throws sparks.  Then return the intestines or fat to their place within. Then have a servant place his hand on the area so that the intestines do not protrude again.  The patient's legs have been spread apart, and a cushion placed beneath him, and another servant ties his legs together.
And another on his chest, holding his hands. Then lower the cautery onto the same mark, your hand holding the cautery upright until it reaches the bone, or repeat it again if it did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And guard against the intestines protruding while cauterizing, so as not to burn them, which would cause the patient either death or a great affliction.  And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed.  And the cautery should be gentle, appropriate for children, and appropriate for adults.
Then treat the cauterized area with butter after three days, until the burn's dryness subsides, then treat it with other ointments until it heals. Let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
His food during his treatment should be what softens his bowels so that the intestines do not protrude when he moves or defecates.  Then, if he wishes to stand up after forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days.  Reduce exertion, fullness from food and drink, and loud crying.
If he follows this treatment, he will heal completely, God willing. I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its proper chapter, God willing.  As for a hernia that occurs in other parts of the abdomen, if you want it to not worsen, cauterize the hernia with a circular cautery, appropriate for its size. Let the amount of skin burned be about two-thirds of it, then treat it as we have described. It will not worsen, God willing.  Some of the earlier scholars mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After marking the hernia with ink, making a line across the top of the hernia and another line below it, place your hand in the middle and cauterize with a single, nail-like cautery. The first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter forty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If, in some part of the body, a fall or blow causes pain that persists for a long time and is not relieved by medication, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pinpoint cautery.  The cauterization of each part should be according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And if the pain and fistula are alleviated, then he is cured from the first cauterization; otherwise, you should repeat the cauterization, for it is the nature of these pains to spread from the affected area to nearby ones, so it is necessary to follow up with cauterization until the patient recovers.
Chapter forty-seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for those afflicted with leprosy, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize him, observe; if the leprosy is incipient and you have treated it as described in the classification, and it has not deteriorated or ceased, and you fear that the corruption will affect all his humours, cauterize his head five times. The first in the usual center of the head, the second below it, towards the forehead near the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one from behind on the nape of the neck.  Apply the cautery somewhat vigorously until it slightly affects the bone.
And scales will peel away from it, making it easier for the thick vapors to escape.  Cauterize the spleen as well, as previously mentioned.  However, if the leprosy has persisted and clearly appeared on the patient, then you should cauterize the head with the aforementioned cauterizations. One cauterization on the tip of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the cervical vertebrae, six on the thoracic vertebrae, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the tail, another above it on the same plate, and two on each thigh, one on each. Two on each knee, one on each, two on each shoulder, two on each elbow, two on the ribs of the chest, and cauterize each joint of his fingers and toes, and each heel of his feet and the wrists of his hands.
And be careful to avoid burning the nerves located on the back of the heels.  A cauterization may also be applied to the pubic bone, the mouth of the stomach, and the liver.  Know that the more cauterizations you apply, the more beneficial and effective they will be.
Know that the patient experiences less pain from cauterization than a healthy person, because his body is numb.  The cauteries should vary in size, depending on the organs and joints, as described in the characteristics of the instruments previously.
Then treat the cauterization with fine crushed carob, honey, and other remedies, until healing occurs, God willing.
Chapter Forty-eight.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness:  If a part of the body becomes numb and is treated with medications, ointments, and bandages, but does not heal, cauterize the same numb part with cauteries appropriate to the size of the affected area of the body;  your cauterizations should be slightly below the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until healed.  Cauterization may also be used for some numbness affecting the hand and foot, which occurs in the vertebrae of the back, at the point where the nerve that moves that limb exits, and this will remove the numbness.
Only those knowledgeable in the anatomy of the body and the exit points of the nerves that move the body should undertake this.
Chapter Forty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of leprosy.
If leprosy persists and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it with a moderate depth of cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and the color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose ointment, and the herb *Polygonum aviculare* (or *Polygonum hydropiper*), and dove's blood or the blood of birds of prey, one part of each. Mix them all together, apply it to a cloth, and bind it to the affected area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it revolves.  Some sages have suggested a severe cauterization in the middle, but I do not see this as advisable, as I anticipate it will ulcerate. I have witnessed this several times.
Therefore, the correct approach is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we have said, or with multiple small cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On cauterizing the abscess.
If an abscess occurs and is slow to mature, either because of the agent causing it, or the patient's age (if the patient is elderly and anemic), or due to time, and you wish to hasten the abscess's maturation, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations, dotted around.
Then leave it, for this will hasten maturation. If you wish to cauterize it further, heat the cautery iron, which is of this form.
and place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be from below, so that the discharge of pus is easy, then treat it with what is necessary until it heals.
Chapter fifty-two.
On cauterizing cankers.
A canker is a corruption that spreads through the tissue, consuming it, like fire consumes dry wood. If you see a canker in a place suitable for cauterization with fire, heat a cautery iron with many small and large nails, according to what suits the location of the canker.
Then cauterize it from all sides until all corruption is removed and nothing remains, then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all scabs and corruption are removed.
Then treat it with healing ointments. If after three days you see that the flesh grows correctly without corruption, otherwise repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas.  The canker can also be treated with a strong medicine.
It acts as a substitute for fire, with faster effectiveness.  We have mentioned its treatment with strong medicine in the classification.  Take it from there when needed.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This affliction often occurs on the soles of the feet. It is a rough, painful condition.  Cauterization can be performed in two ways: either by fire or by strong water.
As for cauterization by fire, heat a hollowed-out cautery, resembling an eagle's beak, made of iron.  It should be sized to encompass the nail on all sides and have a thin edge.  Then, lower it, heated, onto the nail, and rotate your hand with the cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail.
Leave it for three days, allowing pus to form. Then, dress it with crushed, salty wild bread, leaving the dressing on for a night. It will then detach from its roots.  Then treat the wound with a flesh-promoting ointment until healed, if the nails are not inverted.
It often occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet.  Therefore, one should take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's beak, and lower it onto the nail or wart.  Then, pour a small amount of strong water into the tube.
Hold the tube with your hand, gently rotating it, so that the edge of the tube affects the root of the nail, and the strong water penetrates to the root of the nail. The patient should endure the stinging of the strong water for a while.
Then, leave it. The nail will detach from its roots.  Do this one by one until all such things on the body are dealt with. Then treat the affected areas with flesh-promoting ointments after they have detached.
Chapter Fifty-four.
In the treatment of the scabies.
If scabies occurs due to cold in the nerves, or from a fever of the quarter, or something else, it is necessary to cauterize four or five times on the back, between each cauterization and one on the chest. And apply one cauterization on his stomach with the olive-oil cautery.  Then the scabies will subside and the cold affliction will mature rapidly.
Chapter Fifty-five.
In the cauterization of a wound occurring on the body.
Ugly boils may erupt on the body due to thick, corrupt cold matter.  Upon their first appearance, a gentle cauterization should be applied to the head of each boil with a heated stick, whose tip has been ignited with fire, or with the long root of a wild plant, or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Boils, too, should be cauterized in their initial eruption in this manner.  Their active principle will not increase, but dissipate, and the patient will recover, but this should only be done after the patient has been bled (by venesection).
Chapter Fifty-six.
In the cauterization of bleeding occurring when an artery is cut.
Bleeding frequently occurs from an artery severed by an external wound, or when incising a tumor, or cauterizing a part of the body, and similar procedures, and its arrest is difficult.
If this occurs to someone, quickly place your index finger over the mouth of the artery, pressing gently until the blood is contained beneath your finger and nothing escapes. Then, take several small and large olive-shaped cauteries, and heat them in the fire until extremely hot.
Then, take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery ruptured.  Apply the cauterium to the same vein, after quickly removing your finger, holding the cauterium until the bleeding stops.
If the blood spurts forth when you remove your finger from the mouth of the artery and the cauterium cools, quickly take another cauterium from the prepared fire, and continue to do this one after another until the bleeding stops.
Take care not to burn a nerve, lest another affliction befall the patient.  Understand that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be severed, especially if it is large, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by amputation if it has not already been severed. If it is severed, its extremities will contract and the bleeding will cease; or, it may be tightly bound with threads; or, drugs that will stop the bleeding and firmly constrict it may be applied.
As for those who attempt to sever it with a ligature, or by constricting it with cloths, or by applying burning things, and the like, it will not cease in that way, except rarely. If one of these situations presents itself without a physician or remedy being available, let them immediately place the index finger over the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
Press it firmly until the blood is contained and flows from above the wound and the artery, and the finger should not be removed from over it with very cold water constantly until the blood thickens and coagulates and stops flowing.  In the meantime, consider what cauterization or medication is needed.
The Second Chapter.
Concerning incisions, lancing, phlebotomy, and other surgical procedures.
In the first chapter, we mentioned every ailment in which cauterization with fire and caustics are suitable, their causes and reasons, and the instruments.  We have organized this into sections, from the toe to the head.
And I will follow the same path in this chapter, to make it easier for the student to achieve their goal.
Before I begin, you should know, my children, that this chapter contains more deception than the first chapter on cauterization.
Therefore, the warning must be more stringent, because in this chapter, the practitioner often risks expelling the blood upon which life depends, when opening a vein or cutting a tumor, lancing a boil, treating a wound, extracting an arrow, or cutting a stone, and similar procedures.  All of these carry deception and fear, and death often results.
I warn you against venturing into doubtful practices, for in this craft, you may encounter various individuals with diverse illnesses. Some are weary of their ailments and have grown indifferent to death.
Because of the severity of their illness and the prolonged suffering, their sickness shows clear signs of approaching death. Some offer you their wealth, hoping for health, but their illness is deadly.  You must not accept help from anyone with such characteristics.
Let your caution be stronger than your desire and eagerness. Do not undertake anything without certain knowledge of the likely outcome, and in all the treatment of your patients, employ foresight and warnings concerning the prognosis for recovery.
For in this, you will gain praise, glory, remembrance, and thanks. May God, my children, grant you wisdom, and not deny you righteousness and success.  For that is in His hand; there is no god but He.
I have arranged this chapter into sections, following the previous chapter on cauterization, from the head to the foot, so that you may find what you seek, God willing.
Chapter One.
Concerning the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
This ailment frequently affects children at birth if the midwife applies pressure to the child's head roughly.  It may also arise from a hidden, unknown cause.
I have not observed this ailment in anyone but children, and all those I have seen suffered a swift death. Therefore, I have decided to abandon its treatment.  I have observed a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger each day. Until the child could no longer sit up due to the enlargement of his head and the increase in moisture, until he perished.
This moisture either collects between the skin and bone, or under the bone on the peritoneum.  If the moisture is between the skin and bone and the swelling is small, a single horizontal incision should be made in the center of the head, approximately two fingerbreadths long, to allow the moisture to drain.  This is the method of the surgeon's scalpel.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling is larger, make two intersecting incisions, like this:
If the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of this is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and the water descends when you press it with your hand inwards, this is not hidden from you, then three incisions should be made in the middle of the head, in this way.
After the incision, all the moisture will drain out.  Then the incisions are closed with strips and bandages.  Then, apply poultices and oil from above for five days.  Then, remove the bandages and treat the wound with dressings and ointments.  Maintain a moderate head dressing, and provide the patient with all dry, low-moisture foods.
Until the body part strengthens and heals. Another method of incision is to observe where the bone of the swelling and the accumulation of water appear, because it may be more in the back of the head, or in the front, or in the right or left.
Therefore, aim the incision where the swelling and water accumulation appear.  Make the incision as you can, being careful not to cut an artery and cause bleeding, for from that bleeding the patient will die, along with the expulsion of the moisture.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears, known as the "hissers.
When someone suffers from a severe illness in the eyes or chest, and the usual remedies are ineffective, the best treatment is to cut these two arteries.
Therefore, if you wish to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the artery.  Then, hold the patient's neck tight with their garment, and look for where the pulse beats, in the two lowered positions behind the ears.  They are rarely hidden, except in some people.
Then, mark them with ink, and cut them with a dissecting scalpel, down to the bone.  This should be done with the head in a straight line, or if you prefer, you can insert the scalpel underneath the artery and cut upwards.  The length of the cut should be about two clenched fingers.
If the artery is cut, blood will flow out in a pulsating manner, spurting forward in a continuous stream.  If the artery is not visible, then measure from the ear about three fingers, mark it with ink, and cut down to the bone.  And what is necessary...
About six ounces of blood will be released immediately, perhaps more or less, depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of their arteries.  Then, examine the wound.  If any part of the peritoneum remains on the bone, cut it off.
So that a hot swelling does not occur, then bind the wound with a linen thread and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic headaches or acute attacks brought on by sharp humidity and heat in the temples' muscles, or chronic severe headaches, and similar ailments, and treatment by various medical methods is ineffective, we have tried, in these conditions, to dissect the arteries of the temples or cauterize them, as described.
The procedure for dissecting them is that the patient's hair in the temples should be shaved, and the visible artery in the temple should be located.  Its pulse will make it evident, and it is rarely hidden, except perhaps in some individuals.
Or, if the cold is severe and it is hidden, the patient should tighten their neck with their garment. Then, you should rub the area with a cloth or apply warm water until the artery is clearly visible. Then, take the scalpel, which is depicted in this way. Then, gently slice the skin with the scalpel until you reach the artery.  Then, insert a hook and pull it upwards until you remove it from the skin and free it from the membranes underneath from every side.  If the artery is thin, twist it with the hook's end. Then, cut off a section of it to the extent that its ends separate and constrict, and no bleeding occurs.  If it is not severed and cut, the blood will not drain at all. Then, drain the blood from six to three ounces.
If the artery is large, it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread.  Let the thread be either of silk or of bowstrings, so that putrefaction does not quickly reach it before the wound heals, causing bleeding.
Then, cut off the excess between the ligatures.  Do this at that time, or after another time. If you wish, cauterize to the bone with a knife-shaped cauterizing iron, until its ends are severed.  This will accomplish the same work, or better, as we said.
However, if the patient has a fever or a heated temperament, because cauterization helps to destroy moisture, it will be more beneficial.  After removing the arteries, the area should be packed with old cotton and secured with tight bandages.  After healing, treat with dry medications that promote flesh growth and with compresses until he is healed, God willing.
If during your work, bleeding occurs from the artery, quickly cut it, either by cauterization, or fill the area with alum and press your hand firmly until the blood stops. If none of these are available, place your finger on it until the blood clots.
Apply very cold water to the area until the pain subsides and the wound is tightened properly.  A less difficult and easier way than cutting the artery is to cauterize the vein with this knife-shaped cautery iron, after marking the two places with ink.
Apply it very hot until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed at two places so that the distance between its ends is increased.  It will not heal with this cauterization at all. This is a picture of the cautery iron.
It should have two sharp blades, resembling small daggers, but much less sharp than a knife, because if they are as sharp as a knife, the cold will reach them quickly, and the flesh will not cut quickly.  If they have some thickness, the heat of the fire will remain within them.
Cutting the flesh quickly is the best, easiest, and simplest method.  Make sure the distance between the blades is about the thickness of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
For the treatment of constant, hot tearing from the eyes.
If the tearing is constant and originates from the veins on the skull's exterior, and no medicinal treatment is helpful, and you see the patient's face has become red. He feels a crawling sensation in his forehead like ants crawling, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their edges eroded and their eyelids stuck together due to the intensity of the tears.  The earliest practitioners of this treatment resorted to this procedure, calling it "treatment with the sword."  It involves instructing the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then, three parallel incisions are made on the forehead, running along the forehead's length. Each incision is about two fingers long, parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second one slightly off from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third one on the other side.
And be mindful not to sever the arteries on either side, and keep your hand away from the contact of the jaws. After each incision, leave a space of three fingers clasped together. Have with you prepared sponges or many dry cloths to absorb the blood.
Then, insert the sharp, two-pronged scalpel, which is of this design. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, use it to peel away all the skin between the incisions, along with the periosteum on the bone. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision, and then remove the scalpel. And insert into the first incision another instrument, called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth, blunt on the other.  This is its image.
Place the sharp side of the scalpel towards the flesh attached to the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone. Push it until it reaches the middle incision, and sever all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do the same from the middle incision to the other incision. After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, compress the areas from the clotted blood.  Then, in each incision, place a wick of cotton wool, and apply a dressing soaked in a mixture of syrup and oil, or vinegar and oil.
So that a hot swelling does not occur. On the third day, dissolve the ligaments and use plenty of lukewarm water for irrigation. Then treat it with basil ointment, rose oil, and other remedies used for treating wounds, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On treating tears and discharges from the interior of the head to the eyes.
When someone suffers from frequent, severe, persistent discharge, and the eyes appear sunken and small, with impaired vision and ulcerated eyelids with eyelashes falling out. And there is severe, painful pain deep within the head, and frequent sneezing. Know from these symptoms that these materials and discharges come from numerous deep veins.  The best treatment is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is severe, painful pain deep within the head, and frequent sneezing. Know from these symptoms that these materials and discharges come from numerous deep veins.  The best treatment is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead. Or raise it slightly laterally, beginning the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and the incision should be to the bone. Keep your hand away from the moving temporal muscles involved in chewing.  Once the bone is exposed, and all the blood has been dried with a sponge...
Separate the edges of the incision with used cotton or flax thread, then secure it from above with bandages.  Soak the bandages with medicine and oil to prevent a hot swelling.  Once you have resolved it and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should rub the bone to encourage the growth of flesh.
Then treat it with a desiccated preparation that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts wheat flour and four parts of calphonium, and preparing an ointment from them.  This is used for flesh growth in wounds like these.
Chapter Six.
On treating things that fall into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic or semi-metallic stone, such as iron or glass; or a plant seed, such as chickpeas and nuts, and the like; or a liquid, such as water or vinegar, and the like.
Or if it is an animal, if a stone or a similar object that does not grow in the ear falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you see the stone, put a little violet or ceruges ointment on it, then try to remove it by moving the head or by inducing sneezing with a spoon. And close the nostrils when sneezing occurs, after placing a bandage of cloth or wool around the ear and pulling the ear upward.  This treatment often removes it. If it does not come out, try to remove it with gentle forceps, which has this form.
If it is removed with the forceps, otherwise, try to remove it with a gentle, slightly bent, blind hook. If it is not removed with that, then make a copper tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal.
Seal the area around the tube with softened pitch mixed with oil, so that the air has no way out other than the tube, then pull it out with force.  This often removes it. If it is not removed by these methods, take a small piece of mastic gum or a type of gum used for catching birds, and place it on the end of the rod.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, then gently insert it into the ear canal after the ear is dry, if it is not removed by all of the methods described, then proceed to incision before the hot swelling or tightening occurs.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient at the temples to a degree commensurate with their strength. Then, sit the patient before you, tilt their ear upward, and make a small incision at the base of the ear, near the cartilage, in the lowest part.
The incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone. Then, remove it with whatever instruments you can.  Then, quickly suture the incision and treat it until healed.
If the object that fell into the ear is one of the kinds that proliferate and swell, try to remove it by the methods described.  If that does not work, take a thin, delicate forceps, like this.
And try to cut that type of fallen ear grain with it, only if you are certain that the grain has been moistened by ear vapor, so that it becomes many small pieces. Then remove it with a blunt hook, or with a soft cloth, or by suction.
As mentioned, it is then easy to remove it.  As for water entering the ear, the patient should first use a sneezing movement with a censer.  Having previously filled their ear with some old cotton, lying on the affected ear, if it comes out by this method.
Otherwise, take many small, smooth pebbles, warm them slightly by fire. The patient inserts one into the ear hole. The patient should then stand on one leg, on the affected side. Striking another stone against the stone in the ear.
He continues doing this with pebble after pebble until all the water comes out.  Water may also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear, and burning the other end until it is mostly consumed, then repeating with another feather.
Repeat this several times until all the water is removed, or draw it out with a tube, as previously described for the stones.  As for removing an animal that has entered, if it is small like a flea or similar, treat it according to what was mentioned in the classification.  As for...
If its body is large and visible to touch, try removing it with dry cloths and tweezers. This is easier than anything else that invades the ear. As for removing worms that have developed in the ear, if you treated it as mentioned in the classification in the chapter on ear problems and your treatment did not work.
Then you should look at the ear in the sun. If any worm is visible, remove it with dry cloths or fine tweezers. If nothing is visible, take a tube, which is depicted as follows...
Narrow at the bottom and wide at the top.  Insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly with it. Repeat this several times until all the worms are removed. If it does not come out, seal around the tube with wax, as I have mentioned for the stones.
If it does not come out with the methods mentioned, use the ear drops that I have described.  The ancients used them to kill worms.  You will find this in the chapter on ear drops.  You should use the instrument to apply ointments and medications to the ear.  This is its image/illustration:.
As you see, it is made of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top.  If you wish, the tube within the instrument can be made of tight copper.  Or, if you wish, you can take a piece of string and tightly wrap cotton around one end.
Then you put the ointment, or juice, or whatever medication you want, into the tube that is in the ear.  Then, insert the string with the cotton from above and gently squeeze with your hand until the ointment is driven into the ear cavity and the patient feels it.
Have the patient inside [the instrument] and make sure that what is being dripped into the ear has been warmed slightly in the fire.  Be careful that the thing being dripped in is not too cold or too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
In treating ear blockages.
Some children may be born from their mothers' wombs with their ear openings unpierced.
Some people may also experience a blockage in the ear canal due to a wound or a growing piece of flesh, and this blockage might be deep within the ear opening, undetectable by sight.
It may also protrude slightly from the opening, and be visible; the one that occurs deep in the ear and is not visible is, in most cases, harder to cure; and the one that is visible, one should place the patient's ear in the sun. And look at it; if you see the blockage outwardly, then open it with a gentle scalpel, and this would be its image:.
Its tip should have a small, limited protrusion, and the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides, so as not to harm the ear. If the blockage is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a gentle snare and cut it off with extreme gentleness until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, take a smooth, gentle probe, warm it slightly in the fire, and then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage, along with the patient's experience of hearing impairment, then gently remove it.
Be careful not to injure the ear drum. Then, place a wick in the ear, sized to fit the opening, and coat it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure the wound is healed, or take a wick, soak it in water, and sprinkle powdered alum on it.
Use it. If you see that the ear has become inflamed with a hot swelling, then you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick coated with a preparation made from rose oil, so as to reduce the inflammation. Then treat it until it is healed.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear. Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding mentioned in the section on haemostasis.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be wet or dry.  It is necessary to grasp them with a forceps or a needle, and cut them off at their roots with a scalpel.  Then, apply powdered alum to the affected area.
If blood flows from them, cauterize it with a gentle lentil-shaped cautery iron.  Cauterization after cutting is better.  It often returns if any part of the root remains.  If cauterized with fire, the roots are burned and it will not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of cold affecting the eyelids.
A condition resembling a cold in its severity and hardness often appears on the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called a cold, which is the accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids.  If the cold is protruding on the surface of the eyelid and moves in every direction, the treatment is simple: cut it across.
Then gently peel it away from every side until it is removed, then hang it up with a hook and cut it. If you cannot cut it without cutting through the eyelid, that will not harm the patient. If the cut is large, stitch it together and treat it until healed.
If it is small, there is no harm. The ointment will mend and unite it. If the cold is inclined towards the inner surface of the eyelid, turn the eyelid inside out, and hang the cold with a hook, without needing to cut, and trim it from every side.
If it cuts through the eyelid, that will not harm anything. Then wash the eye with salt water after cutting the cold, and treat the area with something that will heal it until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
On treating the stye that appears on the eyelid.
A stye is a swelling in the layers of the upper eyelid.  It appears most often in children.  It weighs down their eyes, causes them colds in the early morning hours, and they cannot look at sunlight. So that the tears come quickly to them.
Therefore, you see them leaning on their faces, and sleeping on them.  Their eyelids beneath the eyebrows are wet, possibly swollen.  The stye is evident.  If you press the area with your fingers, you feel the stye between them.  The method is for the patient to place their head on your lap.
Then take a linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick, large enough to surround the stye on all sides.  Then place it over the stye and press with your fingers on all sides to gather the stye in the center of the circle.
Then, with a lancet, make a transverse incision through the center of that moist area, not larger than an incision made in phlebotomy.  As for depth, it is necessary to cut through the entire skin until you reach the stye.
In most cases, the stye protrudes from the incision as a white fatty piece.  Pull it outward with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, turning your hand to the right and left, until it heals.  Be careful not to enlarge the incision, lest the lancet injure the eye.
If the stye does not appear at the initial incision, you should gently enlarge the incision slightly until the stye protrudes.  Then, pull it out as described.  Then, dip a cloth in vinegar and water, apply it to the area, and bandage it firmly. Some people crush salt.
Place it in the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture. Then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs at the site, treat it with cooling compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of eye dressings.
If superfluous eyelashes grow on the eyelid, deviating from the natural course beneath the natural eyelashes and becoming thick, they harm the eye and cause various ailments such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, white discoloration, and thickening, thus causing blindness.
And the treatment of the eye has four aspects: either by cauterization with fire, or by a strong medicine, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or by cutting and stitching, or by cauterization with a stick, as I have described.
You should place the patient's head on your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns, then insert a needle with thread underneath the eyelid, and pierce the needle and thread through from above, close to the hair itself, and pull the thread upwards through the eyelid.
Then turn it with a spatula, and make a cut in the inside of the eyelid, excluding the excess hair, with a sharp scalpel, from the larger to the smaller incision.  Then remove the thread, and place a small pad of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and stitch the eyelid with thread.
Like the shape of an anise leaf, but the shape should be as much as is needed to lift the eyelid, because this may vary from person to person. Some people may require a certain amount of the eyelid to be cut to match the amount of eyelid relaxation.
Some people need a smaller cut.  All this depends on the relaxation of the eyelid.  Then, using the scalpel, make incisions along the lines you marked, starting from the larger incision towards the smaller one.  Each incision should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of a spatula.
Then, insert a hook into one corner of the skin and peel the entire skin away.  Then, using a needle and thin wool thread, stitch the two edges together.  Wipe away the blood, and attach any excess threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substance.
You may wish to do this, or not bother.  Then, leave the stitches and threads for about three or four days, and then treat it.  If you wish, you may leave the wound unstitched and treat it with something to dry and tighten it.  The eyelid will lift when the wound is closed.  Stitching is better.
This method of eyelid lifting was mentioned by the ancients, but it involves hardship for the patient.  It is a good technique with no risk.  Another method of eyelid lifting is to shape the eyelid like an anise leaf, as described. Then, lift the eyelid using three hooks, which may be separate or grouped in this configuration.
Then, cut away any excess eyelid with a small pair of scissors, in this manner, with precision.
If you cannot hold the hooks in place or if it is not working, take a needle with thread, insert it into the center of the shape, insert another thread near the larger incision, and a third near the smaller incision.  Hold the threads with your fingers, evenly, then lift your hand with a steady motion.
Lift all the marked skin as described, then stitch together the edges of the wound and treat it until healed. If a hot swelling appears after cutting or incision, soothe the swelling with qīrūtī or similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also have its edges turn inward; in this case, the described cuts, stitches, cauterization with fire and strong medicine, and cauterization with fire or strong medicine are to be applied.  Cauterization with fire or strong medicine is more gentle on the patient than cutting and stitching.  The latter is a more difficult procedure.
Cauterization with reeds is done in this way:  Turn the eyelid, make the incision described from the inside, then prepare two thin reeds or sticks, the length of the eyelid and a width smaller than that of a scalpel.
Nibble the ends of each, on both sides, where the threads will be held, then gently bring them together over the remaining part of the eyelid and tightly bind the reeds on both sides. Leave it for several days, as the tightened skin will die, turn black, and putrefy.
Until it falls off on its own. If it takes too long, trim it with nippers, then treat it until healed. When it is healed, the eyelid will rise and the eyelashes will not irritate the eye.  This is how the reeds are made: this shape and exact length and width.
Chapter Twelve.
Removing irritating hairs from the eye with a needle.
If there is a hair or two, the procedure is to take a thin needle, thread it with a smooth, thin silk thread, tie its ends in a very delicate knot, and let the thread's length be about a span.
Then, thread another thin, shorter thread into the needle.  Tie its ends, if desired. Have the patient rest their head on your lap, near the light, so the work is clear.  It is a delicate operation.  Then, using the needle and thread, insert the needle into the root of the superfluous hair.
And push it through the eyelid quickly until you remove it above the natural hair. Then pull the thread upward, through the needle, and the hair—if it's one, two, or three—is removed from the needle.
Then, pull your hand, so that the hair comes out with the needle in the eyelid with the natural hair.  If pulling the thread does not remove the hair, pull the thread downward, using the thread that was previously threaded into the needle, until the needle comes out the top hole.
Then, return the hair to the needle and pull them out. Repeat this until the hair is elevated at the upper hole, visible to the eye. Then, remove the needle and thread, and gently press down on the eye. Leave it pressed for two or three days until the hair is firmly in place, and the surrounding flesh has healed.
If the hair is short, either add a longer hair from the natural hair, so it rises with it, or let it grow longer over time, and then remove it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On treating the stye that occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
This stye, which is called an arnbie, can be either natural or accidental.  Accidental styes result from a wound, a cut, a burn, or the like.
The treatment involves incising the abscess, separating its edges, and placing a linen thread between them, tying it off until it heals.  Things that dry and constrict should not be used in its treatment.
If you do otherwise, the stye will return more severely.  Instead, use things that loosen, such as fenugreek, poultices made with water in which a ram's horn has been boiled, flaxseed, and diachylon ointment melted with some grease.  Apply this to the thread and treat with it.
The goal of the treatment is to prevent the adhesion from returning to its initial state by all means possible.  The method described is only part of the stye's repair and does not necessarily restore the area to its original condition.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the treatment of styes located in the lower eyelid.
This stye, arising from the lower part, is the true stye, and is either natural or accidental.  The accidental stye results from a wound, tear, burn, or similar injury.
The method involves taking a needle with a double thread, inserting it into the flesh, and piercing from the inner to the outer eyelid until the thread is on both sides of the flesh.  Then, pull the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, then stop. Otherwise, take a spatula, place it over the wound, and turn the eyelid.  Make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, with the ends of the incisions meeting at the angle of the cut, forming an angle. So that when they meet, the shape will be similar to this shape:
Then, remove the flesh to the extent that the sharp edge is below the eyelid.  Then, bring together the separated parts with two stitches using a thread of wool.  Then treat it with the relaxing and twisting medications we have mentioned until it heals.
If the ulcer has occurred from a cut, stitch, or cauterization, it is necessary to make a small incision, also without affecting the eyelashes, as previously described. Then, separate the lips with twisting, as we have mentioned.
In summary, treating ulcers, whether above or below, requires adapting the procedure based on the ulcer's specific appearance, as its presentation can vary significantly.  The skilled practitioner should employ the most appropriate method possible.
Until the shape returns to its natural state, or approximates it. The disease itself will often indicate the appropriate treatment and tools.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion can affect many people, causing the upper eyelid to stick to the white of the eye, hindering its free movement and natural functions.  Therefore, a slender instrument should be inserted beneath the eyelid.
Then lift it upwards, or stretch it with forceps, and cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not as sharp as surgical blades, but rather slightly blunt, so as not to disturb the patient during the procedure and risk the scalpel slipping and injuring the eye with its sharpness.  Cut as if you are peeling off the adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its normal position and the entire adhesion heals. Then, irrigate the eye with saline water, or instill a solution of zinjari (a type of astringent) in water into the eye.  Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen thread.
Place wet cotton wool soaked in egg white over the eye. After three days, use poultices until healed.
Chapter Sixteen.
In cutting the nail and deep flesh growths.
The nail comes in two types: either nervous, resembling a tough, thin membrane, or non-nervous, resembling a moist, white, solid substance that shatters if touched by iron or attempted to be grasped with a hook.
No hook can hold onto either type. Both types begin from the largest part, gradually spreading until they cover the eye and block light and eye movement.  The procedure for cutting them involves the patient placing their head on your lap.
Then, the patient opens their eyes and you lift the eyelid with your hand. Next, grasp the nail with a slightly curved hook, pulling it upwards. Then, take a needle, thread a horse or cow hair and a strong thread through it, bend the tip of the needle slightly, and pierce the nail's center.
Pierce it with the needle, tie the nail to the thread, pull it upward, and peel the nail's side towards the pupil with the hair, as if spreading it with the hair to its end. Then, cut the remaining part at the root of the growth with a gentle scalpel or small scissors, leaving the natural flesh of the growth.
So that cutting it does not cause constant tearing. The nail may be pulled with the hook alone, or with the thread, as we said, then the smooth-ended scalpel is used to peel the portion that resembles this image.
Care must be taken that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, causing a tear in the pupil. After cutting, a pinch of powdered salt or some zinc oxide is placed in the eye. This is left for another day. Then, it is treated appropriately until it heals.
If the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle or secure a hook, this type of nail is often treated with medications, healing as described in the classification. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a gentle, smooth, blunt scalpel, like this image. Gently scrape the nail from above using the scalpel, if you see it crumbling and breaking apart.  If only the scraping is effective, place some zinc oxide, red oxide, or powdered salt into the eye from your container.  Press the eye closed for another day.
Then, continue this procedure until all of it is gone. However, if a hot tumor appears in the eye, leave it and treat the tumor until it heals, then resume the scraping until it heals.  And as for the protruding flesh of the cornea...
If the protruding flesh is causing severe injury to the eye, hook it with a forceps, and cut away a portion; do not cut deeply, lest tears begin to flow. Then, place red or zinc oxide into the affected area until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
Cutting superfluous flesh growth in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red, layered flesh may grow, covering the pupil or nearly so, or overflowing onto the eyelids; the eyelids might even turn outward, resembling a rose.
The treatment is to have the patient place their head on your lap, then open their eyes, and using the appropriate forceps, remove all the red flesh.
Or hold it with a lancet or a forceps, then cut the flesh piece by piece until all of it is removed. Protect the eye so as not to injure it during the procedure. You may cut it with the scalpel described in the chapter on trimming the fingernail or with small scissors. As with the forceps described in the next chapter.
Once the removal is complete and all the rose-like growth is gone, fill the eye with powdered salt or instill a corrosive red drug and apply a white-of-egg compress externally to prevent a hot swelling.
If any rose-like growth remains, and you are overwhelmed by bleeding and fear a hot swelling, leave the eye alone and treat it with something to quell the swelling, then return to the procedure until it heals.  Do the same for any excess flesh of this kind that appears in the eye.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye by nature or by appearance with the iron instrument. Do not insert your hand into any of these procedures until you ascertain that the organ can tolerate the procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
In removing obstructions from the eye.
Obstructions are red vessels woven over the eye, hindering its function and weakening it over time.  First, you must observe; if the eye containing the obstructions is strong and has no other ailment besides the obstructions...
Then, the extraction, which is to instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and then remove those vessels with a single or double hook, according to your skill. The hooks should be delicately curved in this manner:
Or two hooks joined together as one, in this manner:
Then, delicately remove those vessels with a fine pair of scissors, wiping away the blood periodically until you see the eye is free of those vessels and the blood has drained.  Protect the eye and do not injure it with the tips of the scissors.  Work in the mid-day sun.
Be very diligent in your work, so as not to cut anything other than those vessels.  Once finished, instill green or red eye drops to consume any remaining obstructions.  If you cannot remove all of them at once, bandage the eye to relieve any pain.
Leave it for several days until the pain subsides and the inflammation cools down.  Then repeat the procedure using the same method, until the eye is healed.  This is the shape of the needed scissors.
Leave it [and let the head of the patient rest in the student's lap, and another student wipe away tears and examine the front and back of the eye.  You] The essential procedure is to open the eye using fixed or triangular-shaped instruments held by a student.
Keep a close watch, with the patient's head resting in the student's lap, and another student wiping away tears and examining the front and back of the eye.  You have the choice to begin removing the vessels from the top or bottom of the eye.  Preferably, dry two forceps, one at the end of the eyebrow, the other at the beginning of it.
Hold the forceps between the middle and index finger, then hang the forceps from below, opposite them.  Then hold them between the ring and pinky finger, and gently pull your hand back so that you see all the vessels have risen.  If desired, cut them with small scissors, or a gentle scalpel.
Insert the needle into the vessel and trace the entire vessel until it rises above the conjunctiva.  Do not cut the vessel; if tears and blood flow (liquefy) upon you.
Then, cut with the scissors any excess from above and below the eyebrow so that only the corneal portion remains unstripped. If you can, lift it off the cornea using the needle; this is better, and it may be possible in some people.
If you cut it, a scab will form in the area, which will settle the pain and prevent swelling. Then repeat the procedure.
Chapter Nineteen.
In returning the quill to the nose.
Doctors call the quill a nassour. If, after treating it with cauterization or a strong, burning medicine as previously described, it does not heal, the only recourse is to lance the swelling when it is ripe and remove all the moisture or pus from it.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument of this form:
The instrument is called the "rough head" and is made of Indian iron. Its head is round like a button, engraved with fine carvings like a whetstone or a scraper.  Place it on the affected area of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while gently squeezing your hand until you ascertain that the corruption has been removed.
Do this several times, then apply binding, dried medicines to the area.  If the area is sealed, flesh grows, the discharge stops, and forty days pass without recurrence, or discharge, or any further incident.
Then know that it has healed.  Otherwise, there is no other recourse than to return the nassour to the nasal opening in this way: expose the bone again with iron or a sharp medicine.  When the bone is exposed, take a probe of this form:
The tip of the iron is triangular, and its shaft is a tapered cone, narrowing towards the tip, as you see. Place it on the bone itself, near the nasal opening, with your hand slightly away from the eye. Then rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
By finding air exiting from it when the patient holds their hand on their nose.  Then, bind the area with the astringent, dried medicines, as I have taught you.  If the flesh grows, and the area hardens, the material that was protruding outward will return to the nose; this will be less difficult for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On returning the protruding eye.
If the entire eye protrudes, and no damage or loss occurs to the sight, the patient should be made comfortable, then held in a recumbent position on their back.  A cupping glass should be placed on the back of the neck, without any particular condition, and a gentle suction performed.
Then, apply a compress made of acacia, aloes, frankincense, and henna to the eye.  Then, the eye should be secured above the dressing with many bandages.  The bandages should be made by taking a series of soft strips of cloth, folding each into four layers, and creating many such strips.
Then, layer them one over the other as needed for the eye.  Secure them firmly with a strong bandage.  Return the cupping glass and apply suction again, without restrictions. Then, remove the cupping glass and keep the eye bandaged for one day and one night.
If the ligament relaxes during this time, it should be tightened again.  Then, remove the bandage after one day and one night, as we said.  If you see the eye has returned to its proper position, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the dressing, bandages, tightening, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-one.
On severing the tendons.
If a rupture occurs in the orbital layer, and the tendon protrudes outside the eyelids, appearing like a tendon, disfiguring the person's appearance, and you wish to sever it, proceed as I describe.
Insert a needle into the tendon's origin, from below upwards.  Then, insert another needle, with a doubled thread from the medial side, and pierce it. Leave the first needle as it is.
Then, cut the place where the doubled thread is bent, and tie some of the tendon around the needle and tighten it firmly.  Then, remove the needle and apply wool soaked in egg white to the eye. Leave it until the threads and tendon fall out. Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  The tendon may be tightened from all sides with a circular bandage until the eye becomes more prominent. Then, use a thin scalpel to reach the depths of the eye, causing the whitish moisture to flow out, and the eye to droop. Then tighten it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of the abscess.
This affliction, called an abscess, is a collection of matter in the eye, resembling descending water, but without it.  The method of treatment is that the patient sits upright on a chair, and then you take their head with your hands from both sides.
And you move it so that you see the matter move downwards with your eyes, then you hold it still so that it does not move.  The light will return, and the patient will see things as they used to see them.  If it does not descend downwards, we know it is water. If the matter does not descend as described.
Otherwise, have the patient sit before you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision above the corneal membrane, where the adhered material meets the corneal membrane in the limbus, until the matter is expelled.
Then, drop warm water into the eye, in which honey has been mixed, or water in which licorice and honey have been boiled.  Then treat with further remedies until it heals.
The twenty-third chapter.
We have previously described the types of water in a detailed and explained classification; consult that for the proper water to use for instillation.  At that time, the patient should sit before you, seated facing the light near the sun.
Tie and firmly hold the healthy eye, then raise the eyelid with your left hand if the affected eye is the left eye, or with your right hand if the affected eye is the right eye.
Then, place the tip of the cup close to the limbus, slightly pressing it against the white of the eye, nearer the smaller conjunctiva.  Then push the cup forcefully while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel the cup has reached an empty space.
The depth of the cup's insertion should be the same distance as from the pupil to the edge of the colored iris (limbus).  The copper cup, due to the clarity of the cornea, will be visible to the observer as though it were part of the eye. Then, raise the cup to the area where the fluid is located.
Then press it downward repeatedly. If the fluid descends immediately, the patient will see what has been opened to their sight by the cup, which is in their eye. Then rest for a while. If the fluid rises, lower it again without removing the cup.
If it settles and does not rise, remove the cup gently, twisting your hand slightly. Then dissolve a little of clear, fine salt in the fluid and wash the eye from the inside.  Then apply a moistened compress or bandage to the entire outside of the eye.
Apply rose oil and egg white and bandage the healthy eye.  As for us and the people of our time, we apply crushed cumin with egg white. If the cup does not enter the eye due to its hardness, for some people have extremely hard eyes. One should take the lancet called the *al-bārid*, which has this form:
Pierce only the adhered part with it, do not delve into the piercing.  Instead, gently insinuate the cup, then insert the cup as previously described. Once your work is complete, prepare a secure and dark bedroom for the patient to lie on their back.
He must refrain from all movement and coughing.  His food should be soft and easily digested, and he must not move his head at all, right or left.  The bandage remains in place for three days.  Then, in that same darkened room, his vision is tested.
Show him objects, then remove the bandage on the seventh day.  One should not do this during the treatment or immediately after the cupping, but rather before the water rises rapidly due to intense gazing.
If a hot swelling appears, the eye should be unbound before the seventh day, and treated to soothe the swelling.  Once the swelling subsides, then release the vision and place a veil over the face, allowing his sight to adjust gradually from beneath the veil for several days while he remains in the dark room.  Then...
He is gradually released from the room and allowed to manage his affairs.  Know that the student of cupping cannot dispense with repeated observation before undertaking the procedure.  I have heard that some Iraqis claim to make a hollow cup in Iraq that draws out water.
I have seen no one in our country perform this, nor have I read about it in any of the earlier books.  It may be a recent innovation.  Here are illustrations of various types of cupping instruments, for their clarity.
They are made of copper, particularly, and their tips are precisely this shape: triangular, sharply pointed.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
For the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Various growths may develop in the nose, some resembling scorpions with many legs, others cancerous, hard, and dark-colored, and still others soft and not dark-colored.
If these growths are soft, not malignant or cancerous, the patient should sit facing the sun, their nostril opened, and a hook inserted into the growths, pulling them out.  Then, using a sharp, gentle scalpel, cut what is caught from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh is gone. If any remains that you cannot cut, then remove it gently with one of the softer instruments, so that nothing of it remains.  If blood or a hot swelling prevails.
If it is a malignant tumor, then promptly cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone. Then, after the cutting, apply vinegar and water or a drink to the nose, so that it opens and moisture flows from it to the throat.
Know that it has healed. If the moisture does not drain properly, know that there is a growing flesh within the porous bones that the cutting instrument did not reach.  In that case, you should take a thick linen thread.
Tie many knots in it, placing each knot the size of a finger or less.  The patient maneuvers one end of the thread into their nose with a probe or anything suitable, shaped like a button, and pulls the thread so that it reaches the nostril.
It emerges at the throat.  Children often do this in school, and it's easy for whoever desires to do it.  Then, gather the two ends of the thread—one that came out of the mouth and the other that remains in the nose.
Then, use the knots in the thread to dissect the flesh, doing this until you know that the flesh has been separated by the knots of the thread. Then remove the thread, and once the blood has been cleaned from the nose, place a thread soaked in Egyptian ointment into the nose.  Do this for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes any remaining flesh.  Finally, a lead tube is placed in the nose for a number of days until it heals. If further drying treatment is needed, use that.
This is an image of the *mas'at* used to instill ointments and medicines into the nose.
It is made of silver or bronze, resembling a small, open lamp, with a channel as well.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the applicator's ointment container flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when heating ointment or any other liquid substances within it.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Warts often grow on the tip of the nose, increasing in size and number over time, until their appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and remove it entirely. Then, either cauterize the area or apply a burning medication in place of cauterization. If you delay cutting it until it grows large, observe it; if it is hardened, solid, dark-colored, and insensitive, ...
Do not use iron on it, for it is a cancerous tumor.  I have often seen that cutting this tumor brought about a great calamity for the sufferer.  If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that it can be cut entirely, ... Then drain the pus, and cut it without hesitation or delay. Treat the area with something that dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear. If its connection is separated by a wound or something similar, know that if a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, rarely will treatment be successful, except in some people.
Therefore, when someone presents with such a condition, examine if the wound is fresh and bloody. If so, bring the edges of the wound together by stitching and then treat it until it heals.  If the separation of the connection has separated its edges and each gap is sound, then it is necessary to dissect each gap with the thickness of the visible skin until it bleeds.
Then, bring the edges together with stitches, tighten them, and sprinkle powdered sumac and frankincense on them. Place a plaster of Palestinian ointment, or another of the uniting ointments, on top of the powder. Leave it tightened for two or three days, then remove it.
Then change the medication and leave it until the threads detach on their own.  Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The method of suturing is to bring together the separation of the connection, either with needles as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread as I explained there.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
On removing the knots that appear on the lips.
Many people may have small, hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling carbuncles, others smaller or larger.  Therefore, you should turn the lip inside out, cut every knot, and remove them with forceps.
Cut it from every side, then fill the wound with powdered alum after cutting to stop the bleeding.  Then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the areas with something astringent until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-eight.
On cutting excess flesh in the gums.
Excess flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients called "apuls".  It should be grasped with forceps or a curette, cut at its base, and allowed to bleed.  Then, powdered alum should be placed on the area.
Or one of the astringent powders, dried. If that flesh returns after treatment, it often does. Cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-nine.
On cleaning teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums.  These may turn black, yellow, or green, leading to gum disease and an unsightly appearance of the teeth.
The patient should be seated before you, head resting on your lap.  Clean the tooth or teeth exhibiting scales and sand-like material until none remains.  Do the same with black, green, or yellow discoloration, and any other blemishes, until clean.
If the initial cleaning removes the impurities, well and good.  Otherwise, repeat the cleaning process on another day, and again on a third day, until the desired result is achieved.  Know that teeth require various instruments of differing shapes and forms, according to the task at hand.
For the instrument used to clean the inside of a tooth is different from the one used for the outside, and the one used between the teeth has a different shape.  You should have a variety of these instruments prepared.
Chapter Thirty.
On the extraction of teeth.
One should treat the tooth's pain by every possible means, and delay extraction.  For once extracted, there is no return, as it is a valuable substance, even if extraction is unavoidable.
Therefore, if the patient is determined on extraction, you must first make sure the tooth is definitely painful. Often the patient deceives himself about the pain, thinking it is in a healthy tooth and extracting it, yet the pain does not subside until the diseased tooth is extracted.  We have witnessed this frequently in the actions of the barbers.
If you are certain the pain is in the tooth itself, then you should use a strong scalpel to cut around the tooth, separating the gum on all sides.  Then, move it gently, little by little, with your fingers or fine forceps, to loosen it.
Then, with the large forceps, firmly grasp the tooth, holding the patient's head between your knees to prevent movement.  Pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it.  If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and gently insert it under the tooth from all sides, moving it as you did previously.
If the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill the hole with a cloth and seal it firmly with a thin, smooth instrument so that it does not break when you apply the forceps.  You should carefully cut around the gum on all sides, thoroughly.
Take care to avoid breaking it, for a piece left behind will become a greater affliction for the patient than the initial pain.  Beware of what the ignorant barbers do, rushing to extract it without using the methods we have described.
Often they inflict great suffering on people, the least of which is breaking the tooth and leaving the roots, either all or some of them. Or, they might even pull out some of the jawbone, as we have observed repeatedly.  After extraction, the patient should rinse the area with liquid, vinegar and salt.  If bleeding occurs, which is frequent, then powder some alum and apply it to the area.
Otherwise, if alum does not help, use the forceps.  The design of the delicate forceps used to move the tooth first:  long handles, short grip, and thick to prevent bending when gripping the tooth.  This is an image of the large forceps.
The handles should be thick, so that when grasped, they do not yield or bend. The tips should be short.  The forceps should be made of Indian iron or tempered steel, with secure, fitted tips, and teeth that interlock for a firm and tight grip.
The tips can also be shaped like a file, and thus will be strong and precise.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On the extraction of tooth roots and the removal of fractured jawbones.
If, during tooth extraction, a root remains fractured, a piece of cloth soaked in oil should be placed on the area for one or two days to allow the area to relax, then forceps or pliers should be inserted. Which resemble the beak of a bird called a 'balrajah'. This is an image of the forceps.
If it is not possible to remove it with these forceps, then it is necessary to make a hole in the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert a small lever-like instrument, of which this is a picture.
Short, slightly thick, and not pointed, lest it breaks. If the root is removed by this, otherwise, use these other instruments, which are pictured. The first one is triangular and somewhat thick.
Another gentle triangular image.
We may also use this two-pronged instrument, of which this is also a picture.
And with other instruments and tools, as mentioned in the description of teeth extraction. We may also use this instrument, resembling a large fish hook, which this is a picture of.
Triangular, bent, slightly thick at the tip so it does not break; and it should not be pointed. Know that tooth extraction tools are numerous, and so are other tools; almost innumerable. A skilled artisan, with his craft, may invent tools, tailored to the work and the diseases themselves.
Because some diseases were not described by the ancients with instruments due to their diverse types, if a bone in the jaw or in one of the mouth's bones breaks or decays, investigate the area using the appropriate tools and tweezers as described for removing roots.
And we use a forceps, this is its image.
It should have some slight thickness to firmly grasp the bone so it does not slip until it is removed. Then, treat the area with appropriate medications. If the bone has mild decay, remove its decay and blackness until it is clean and then treat it until it heals.
The Thirty-second Chapter.
In the eruption of teeth that grow over others.
Teeth, if they erupt outside their natural course, disfigure the appearance, especially in women and slaves.  If a tooth has erupted behind another, it is necessary to consider this.
If it cannot be moved forward or backward, extract it.  If it is attached to another tooth, cut it off using this instrument, whose image is this:
It resembles a small beak, made of sharp Indian iron.  Cut it out over several days, due to the tooth's hardness, so as not to dislodge other teeth. If it is protruding and firmly in place, cool it down with an Indian file, whose image is this.
It should be entirely of Indian steel, very finely engraved, like the file used to make needles.  Cool the tooth gradually over many days, gently, so as not to dislodge it and cause it to fall out.  Then, smooth it finally and scrape it with some scrapers.
If a tooth has broken and is irritating the tongue while speaking, it should also be cooled down until the roughness of the fracture is gone, it becomes smooth, and does not irritate the tongue or impair speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In fastening loose teeth with silver or gold thread.
If older teeth become loose and shift due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot eat because they fear the teeth will fall out, and the astringent remedies were ineffective.
The remedy is to fasten them with gold or silver thread, gold being preferable, as silver tarnishes and rots after a few days, whereas gold remains the same indefinitely. The thread should be of medium thickness and fineness, sufficient to fit between the teeth.
The method of fastening is to take the thread, insert its fold between the sound teeth, and then weave the ends of the thread through the loose teeth, one or more, until it reaches the sound tooth on the opposite side.
Then, weave back to the starting point, tightening gently and skillfully so that the teeth do not move.  Tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth to prevent slippage.  Cut the excess thread ends with scissors, gather them, twist them together with a file, and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
So that the tongue is not harmed.  Then leave it tightened like this as long as it remains. If it loosens or breaks, tighten it again with another thread, and it will be usable forever.  This is the image of the teeth and method of fastening in two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
A single or two teeth may be returned to their place after falling out, fastened as described, and remain.  Only a skilled craftsman can do this.  He may also carve bone from an ox, shape it like a tooth, and place it in the space where the tooth has been lost. And it is tightened, as we said, and it remains usable.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On severing the ligament that lies under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament lying under the tongue may be either natural, present from birth, or accidental, resulting from a healed wound.
The procedure is to open the patient's mouth, place their head in your lap, and lift their tongue.  Then, cut the ligamentous nerve transversely so the tongue is released. If there is some stiffness or entanglement, and it is from a healed wound, use a forceps to slice it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knot is loosened.
Be careful not to cut too deep into the flesh, lest you sever an artery and cause bleeding. Then, after the cut, rinse the area with rosewater or vinegar and cool water. Afterwards, place a linen wick under the tongue for the patient to hold each night.
To prevent re-adhesion.  If bleeding occurs, apply powdered alum to the area.  If the bleeding is excessive, cauterize the area with a suitable lens-shaped cautery iron. Then treat him with other remedies until he is healed.
Chapter Thirty-five.
Removing a toad that has developed under the tongue.
A tumor resembling a small toad may develop under the tongue, hindering its normal function, and possibly growing to fill the mouth.  The procedure is to open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the tumor.
If you see it dark-colored or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation, do not attempt to treat it, for it is cancer.  If it leans towards white and has moisture, use the forceps and carefully dissect it with a scalpel, freeing it from all sides.
If bleeding occurs during the procedure, apply powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then resume the procedure until the tumor is completely removed.  The patient should then gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with further appropriate therapy until healed.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
On the treatment of tonsil tumors.
Any tumors growing in the throat may present glands resembling those appearing externally, called tonsils. If you treat them with the methods mentioned in the classification, and they do not heal,
If the tumor is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive, do not use the iron.  If it is red and thick-based, also do not use the iron, for fear of bleeding. Instead, allow it to mature, either by softening or spontaneous rupture.
If it is white, round, and thin-based, this is what should be cut. Before proceeding, observe if the inflammatory swelling has completely subsided or if some of the swelling has reduced.
Then, have the patient sit facing the sun, head resting on your lap, mouth open.  Have an assistant hold the tongue down with an instrument; this is its image:
It is made of silver or bronze, thin like a knife.  Once the tongue is held down, and you can clearly see the tumor, use a hook and insert it into the tonsil, pulling it outwards as much as possible, without pulling any of the membranes along with it.
Then, cut it with an instrument resembling scissors, but with both ends curved, each point very sharp.  It is made of Indian iron or Damascene steel.
If this instrument is unavailable, then cut it with a scalpel, this is its image:
Sharp on one side, blunt on the other.  After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner.  Then, after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, have him gargle with water boiled with pomegranate rind, or rue leaves, or similar astringents, until the bleeding stops.  Then treat it until healed.  Other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils; cut these in the same way as the tonsils.
I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, approaching the size of a small lump, nearly obstructing the throat.  The woman was breathing through a narrow passageway.  It had prevented her from eating and drinking.
She was close to death if she remained for a day or two.  The tumor had grown two branches that extended to her nostrils.  Acting quickly, I inserted a hook into one of them, and pulled out a suitable piece.
Then I cut it where it emerged from the nostril, and did the same with the other nostril's protrusion.  Then I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue, and inserted the hook into the tumor itself.  I cut off some of it, and only a small amount of blood was released.
The woman's throat opened up, and she immediately drank water and then ate food.  We continued to cut away at the tumor repeatedly for a long time, and the tumor would regenerate parts that were cut away.  This continued for a long time for both of us.
I cauterized the tumor within her throat, hoping to stop its growth.  Then I left the area, and I do not know what God did to her afterwards.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
In cutting a tumor of the larynx.
If a tumor, called *'unba'*, descends to the larynx and swells, and is white and oblong, it is called a *'amood'*.  If it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called an *'unba'*.  If treatment as described in the classification does not work.
If the hot tumor has subsided and is thin, it should be cut.  If it is a solid, round mass without length, and is blood-red, dark-colored, black, or without sensation, it should be avoided.
In this case, there is risk to the patient. Therefore, if you see the tumor with the characteristics mentioned - whiteness and length - the patient should be seated facing the sun, and the tongue should be pressed with the instrument described earlier. Then, the snare should be inserted into the *'unba'*.
Pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the section on cutting the tonsils.  Only the excess beyond the natural amount should be cut, as cutting more will harm the voice and speech.
After the cutting, use the methods described for cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is hesitant about having it cut, use the cautery method without fear or caution. The cautery should be with a sharp medicine, and the patient's head should be placed on your lap.
Then, press the patient's tongue with the instrument mentioned before.  Take the sharp water mentioned in the section on cauterization, mix it with un-extinguished gypsum, making a consistency that is neither thick nor thin. Fill the indentation of the instrument with this mixture.  This is its form/image:
The tip where you place the medicine has a concavity like the concavity of a mrod spoon.  Place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself.  The patient should be lying on their side, so saliva can drain from the mouth, from inside the throat, to prevent anything from going back into the throat and hurting them.
Then, hold the instrument with the medicine and apply pressure to the uvula for about half an hour until you see it has blackened and the burning from the medicine has subsided. If you prefer, take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the tip of a mrod, and moisten the cotton with the medicine.
Insert the mrod with the cotton into the tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Repeat this several times until you achieve the desired level of cauterization of the uvula.  Then leave it; it will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to repeat the application of the medicine, repeat it.
After the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in clarified butter, removing any remaining medicine. Then, the patient should rinse with cold water, and be treated externally with lotions and internally with gargles until healed. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and less frightening.
The uvula can also be treated with something gentler than cauterization or cutting, using incense in this manner:  Take frankincense, myrrh, sage, wormwood, dittany, chamomile, and quassia, or similar herbs.  Gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
Bring it to a boil, and the pot should be sealed with clay.  A small hole is made in the lid, into which the hollow instrument is fitted.  This instrument is made of silver or brass.
Insert the end with the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the uvula through the tube, causing the uvula to shrink.  Repeat this process several times until it withers.  Avoid using this treatment at the very beginning of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling.  Instead, it is necessary to do this when the hot swelling has subsided.  If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit an egg shell to the end of it, so as not to burn the patient's mouth.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth.  This is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
For removing thorns and similar things that lodge in the throat.
Often a bone or fish thorn, or something similar, lodges in the throat.  It is necessary to remove what is visible to the eye, after pressing the tongue with the instrument in the light.
To make clear what is in the throat.  If something is not visible and hidden in the throat, it is necessary to induce vomiting before the patient's food digests in the stomach.  Perhaps the lodged object will come out with the vomit, or the patient will swallow a piece of linen or a stalk of lettuce.
Or the patient may swallow a piece of dry bread, or take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a thread, and swallow it. When it reaches the thorn, pull the thread quickly. Repeat this several times.
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out. If it does not come out with these methods, use a lead instrument like this:
It is slightly thicker than a stylus.  At its tip is a bend.  The patient, raising their head, gently inserts it into their throat, taking care not to touch their larynx to avoid coughing. This will push out the bone or thorn.  Or the physician may insert it with their hand.
The patient's insertion is better, as they know the location of the lodged object.  They push it downwards or pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all according to what they are able to do until it is removed.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
Removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If the leech, treated with the remedies described in the section on medications, proves ineffective, then examine the patient's throat in the light of the sun, after pressing their tongue with the instrument described to you.
If you spot the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a gentle, firm forceps.  If that's not possible, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech.  Then insert a heated iron into the tube's interior.
Repeat this several times. The patient should refrain from drinking water all day.  Then, he should take a bowl filled with cool water, open his mouth over it, rinse his mouth, and not swallow any of it. He should move the water with his hand from time to time.
If the leech feels the water, it will fall off. If it doesn't come out with the methods described, fumigate the throat with urine and with *ḥalītiyy* using the instrument described for inhaling vapors to the throat.  Repeat this several times, and it will fall off.
The procedure for fumigation is to take a container holding heated embers, the container covered with a lid having a hole in the middle. Place the end of the instrument in the hole, then place the incense in the container. The patient puts their mouth at the end of the tube and closes their mouth so the incense reaches the throat.
The leech will fall off at that point. If it does not, the fumigation is repeated several times.  The patient should endure thirst and eat salty foods and garlic, but drink no water.  This procedure will be successful in removing the leech.  This is the form of the instrument used to pull the leech from the throat once it is seen.
It resembles tweezers, as you see, but has this curvature that enters the throat.  Its tips resemble a bird's beak.  They are rough like a whetstone, and if they grasp something, they will not release it.
Another instrument is used to hold the tongue. It is a wide iron ring, sized to fit over the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth, standing upright on its side, keeping the mouth open against the patient's will. The patient cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
Description of the instrument used to open the mouth in this exact manner.
Chapter Forty.
It will deal with the lancing and incision of tumors.
Tumors are of many diverse types, as will be described individually in this book.  They differ in their lancing and incision in two ways: one is from the nature of the tumor itself and the humors it contains.
The second type is according to the locations in the body where they occur, because a tumor arising in the head is different from one arising in the buttocks, and a tumor arising in fleshy tissue differs from one arising in a joint.  Each has its own treatment procedure.
Some tumors should not be lanced until the pus within them has matured and is complete, while others should be lanced while they are still raw and not fully matured, such as tumors that are close to joints.
Because if a tumor arises near a joint and grows to the point of causing the surrounding tissue to decay, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing dysfunction of that limb, or the tumor may be near a vital organ.
Because if you delay lancing it until it matures, you will harm the vital organ, or if it is near the buttocks, lance it while raw.  It is necessary to lance an immature, raw tumor near the buttocks to prevent the rot from spreading deep into the buttocks, becoming a fistula.
And it will become incurable in some cases.  You should know the time to lance tumors that have fully matured, which is when the tumor pain subsides, the fever is gone, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and other similar symptoms.
The incision should be made at the lower part of the tumor, if possible, so that the discharge flows downwards more easily, or at the thinnest, most prominent part of the tumor.  If the tumors are on the hands and feet, the incision should run along the length of the limb.
And at the locations of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and generally in all flat, non-bending areas.  For areas that bend, the incision should follow the contours of that area.  If the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is best to avoid lancing it.
Until its maturation is complete, as we said. If you lance it before that, the discharge of pus will be prolonged, causing much harm and filth, and its lips and recesses might harden. Some tumors may be lanced across the limb, if necessary, or as the organ requires.
Small tumors should be lanced once; large tumors should be lanced widely or with many incisions, according to the size of the tumor.  Some tumors may require the skin to be scraped or cut, if it has become like a torn cloth.
Some have become somewhat dead, like what is seen in many bumps and cavities. Some are split into a three-sided shape, and some have a shape like a rue leaf, like a dropsy tumor.
Some require a circular or crescent-shaped incision, or similar cuts.  If the tumor has no head, like flat, smooth tumors, a simple incision should suffice. If the tumor is large, has accumulated for a long time, and you have lanced it, do not rush to drain all the pus at once.
Rather, drain some of it, then compress the tumor for another day, and drain some more pus.  Do this repeatedly, gradually, until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a young child, or an elderly person, the animal spirit often dissolves with the sudden discharge of pus.  The patient may die unexpectedly without your knowledge. Therefore, take great care in this matter.
After lancing these tumors, you should cleanse the wound and examine it. If the tumor wound is small, or the incision is simple, use a bandage made of linen or old cotton. If the tumor is large and there are many incisions,
Then you should insert a thread into each incision until they meet. If the tumor has caused some skin to be detached or eroded, you should fill it with old cotton or linen lint, without moisture, and compress it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, after soaking a linen cloth in them, and apply it to the bleeding area repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the remedies and treatments, and the cauterization methods, that we have described in many places in this book and in the section on classifications. If it is winter, and the tumor area has many nerves, you should soak the bandages with warm water and oil.
And apply them to the area. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply bandages soaked with water and oil, or with a cold drink and oil, until the third day, as we said.  Then you should loosen the bandage and cleanse the tumor.
And use treatments similar to these until it heals. This is what you need to know about treating tumors in general.  As for detailed treatment, each tumor's method of treatment has been mentioned in a summarized and categorized way.
Chapter Forty-one.
On the treatment of tumors appearing on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp, which are a type of swelling enclosed in membranes.  They have characteristics like a hen's egg, and there are many types. Some are fatty, and some contain a moisture resembling mud.
Some contain a moisture like broth or soup, and so on.  Others are hard and stony.  All of them are harmless to lance and remove, unless a blood vessel is encountered during the incision.
The procedure for lancing them is to first probe them with the instrument whose image will follow, called the 'meds', so as to know what they contain. If they contain moisture, lance them lengthwise with a simple incision, like this image:.
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~. If the moisture has drained, dissect the sac containing the moisture and cut it all away completely, leaving nothing behind, as it often recurs if any is left.
Then, dip a cotton swab in the astringent ointment, if available, or else in salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it until the next day, as it will consume any remaining sac material. Then, repeat the application of the cotton swab with the astringent, a second and third time if necessary.
Until you are certain that no part of the sac remains.  Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals.  If the swelling contains fatty material, lance it in this manner:
Lance it firmly, and insert forceps into the edges of the wound.  Dissect it from all sides and do your utmost to remove the peritoneum it contains. If an artery is encountered, do what we have described for it previously; and do the same for the swelling, if it is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as previously described. The incision on hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these swellings in the head, in some people, have no moisture at all. This is because I incised a swelling in...
the head of an old woman, and found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone.  It could not be broken, even if someone threw it, it would only chip.  The other swellings that occur on the heads of children are not like this.
At the roots of the ears, make a simple incision in all of them.  Make the opening from below so that the matter drains downward. Then treat it with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-Two.
Concerning the incision on swine-like swellings that frequently appear on the neck. These swellings often appear on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins.  They may also appear elsewhere on the body.  A single swelling may appear on the neck, or many, and some may develop from others.
Each such swelling has its own enclosed membrane, as do tumors and swellings of the head, as we have described.  There are many types of these swellings, some stony, some containing moisture, and some malignant, not responding to treatment.
Among those I examined, some presented favorably to the touch.  Their appearance was close to the skin color; they moved in all directions and were not attached to the neck's nerves, veins, or arteries, nor were they deep-seated. Therefore, it should be incised simply, from top to bottom, along this line: from line ~J~ to line ~B~.
Peel it away from all sides, and stretch the skin flaps with a hook or two, or many hooks if necessary, as we described for tumors of the head. Remove it gradually, taking care not to cut a vein or nerve. The scalpel should not be overly sharp.
So that your hand does not inflict more cuts than necessary or distress the patient by cutting what does not need cutting.  If you do cut a vein or artery and that prevents you from continuing, apply powdered alum or some of the substances that cause clotting of the blood to the wound.
Close the wound and leave it until the inflammation subsides, the wound relaxes, and it is about to become infected.  The bleeding will cease then; return to your work until you are finished.  Then, check with your index finger if any small pieces remain, and remove them, removing them one by one.
If a large vein is located at the root of the piece of flesh, you should not cut that piece of flesh at its root.  Instead, tie it tightly with a doubled thread and leave it until it falls out on its own without causing harm. Then fill the wound with used cotton, soaked in Egyptian ointment, and treat it.
If you have cut the entire piece of flesh, you should bring together the edges of the wound and suture it immediately, after making sure that no remnants remain.  If you see that a portion of the piece of flesh is left over, note that.
You should aim for the root and base of the piece of flesh when cutting it, using the suturing and other methods that we mentioned.  For pieces of flesh containing moisture, apply a simple dressing where you see signs of ripeness, positioning it on the lower part, as we have said.
Then, after the dressing, apply ointment, like Egyptian ointment, to consume any remaining corruption.  Once you see the wound is clean, treat it with ointments that promote tissue growth until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Three.
In the incision of the throat for a tumor occurring inside the throat.
The ancients described this incision of the throat.  I have not seen anyone in our country perform it, and this follows their account.  However, sufferers of quinsy should avoid incision of the throat, as it will not benefit them.
In order that all tumors and the lung may be diseased, and for those with a burning tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if the cause is not in the trachea, incision of the throat is necessary to escape the harm caused by suffocation.
Therefore, if we wish to do this, we should incise the throat below three circles of the trachea, or four small incisions across between two circles, to the extent of the incision in the diaphragm, not in the cartilage.  This place is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it, if the surgeon is timid, he should extend the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until, when he reaches the trachea, he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then, he should incise the diaphragm that we described, and the incision of the trachea is evident from the phlegm which emerges from it with what is pierced and from the cessation of the voice.  He should leave the wound open for a while.  When the time in which suffocation was feared has passed, he should bring the edges of the wound together from the skin.
And he incises it alone, apart from the cartilage.  Then, the medicines that cause flesh to grow are used until it heals.  The author of this book says, the explanation of this passage that we have recounted is that if they see the patient's throat blocked by one of these tumors that have been mentioned.
When the patient is close to death, and is concerned that he will stop breathing, they proceed to incise the throat so that the patient may breathe through the wound, and be saved from death.  However, they are instructed to leave the wound open until the course of the disease is completed, and the course is typically three days or similar.
At that point, they instructed to sew up the wound and treat it until it heals.  What I personally witnessed was that a servant took a knife and inflicted a cut on her throat, severing some of the bronchus.  I was called to treat her, and I found her weakening as a slaughtered animal weakens.  I uncovered the wound.
I found that the blood coming from the wound was slight, so I was certain that she had not severed an artery or a vein.  Air was escaping from the wound.  I immediately sutured and treated the wound until it healed.  The servant experienced nothing more than a hoarseness in her voice.
And after a few days, she returned to her best state.  From this, we say that incision of the throat poses no danger.
Chapter Forty-Four.
Concerning the incision on a tumor that appears on the larynx from the outside, and is called a laryngeal tumor.
This tumor, called a laryngeal tumor, is a large tumor the color of the body; it is common in women and is of two types.
Either it is natural or accidental; the natural one has no remedy.  The accidental one is of two kinds, one like fatty tumors, and the other like a tumor caused by arterial complication; incision poses a danger in the latter. Therefore, one should not use the knife at all, except for small ones.  If, probing and examining them with a probe, you find them similar to fatty tumors and not connected to any blood vessels, incise them as you would fatty tumors. Remove whatever is contained within the cyst if it is in one, otherwise, remove all of it, and then treat the affected area with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the incision of various tumors.
Tumors are of many types, and all their types have been mentioned in the classification.  It is necessary to explain here the difference between a tumor and an abscess, since it is a source of difficulty. I say that an abscess is accompanied by heat, fever, and severe pain until the inflammation subsides. Pus develops, and then the fever and inflammation subside.  A tumor is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain. It is enclosed in a peritoneal sac, which is a specific covering for it. Its color is the same as the surrounding skin. It begins like a boil and becomes like a cyst, larger or smaller.
Tumors are of two types: either fatty, or containing moisture; and the varieties of moisture are numerous, as mentioned in the classification. Therefore, when treating a tumor, one must first probe and examine it with the instrument called the "midas," as its image will be shown in the following chapter.
Assess the size of the tumor, then remove the midas and observe what comes out afterward. If a liquid substance of any color emerges, make a small incision, as described for other tumors. If no moisture follows the midas, then know it is fatty.
Make a firm incision on it in this manner, as I have instructed you.  Suspend it with hooks, and carefully peel the skin from all sides.  If possible, preserve the sac intact, extracting the tumor along with it.
If the sac breaks during the procedure, and you are unable to remove the tumor intact, which frequently happens, remove it piece by piece, so that nothing remains. If any part remains, regardless of size, the tumor will likely return.
If you are unsuccessful and only a small part remains, cauterize the wound with some sharp, potent cauterizing agent, firmly close the wound, and apply something to alleviate the inflamed tumor, and treat it with other remedies until it heals. If the tumor is large, suture its edges and treat with remedies that promote healing.
If you encounter a bleeding vein, whether prominent or not, promptly apply powdered alum to the affected area, keep it pressed for two or three days until the wound becomes suppurated and the bleeding subsides, then return to removing any remaining tumor.
Chapter Forty-Six.
In the forms of instruments.
The various types of spatulas used for scraping and probing, which are of three kinds: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large spatula.
Image of a medium spatula.
Image of a small spatula.
Made from hardened steel, square-ended, and tight fitting to quickly enter tumors.  These are images of probes, called "bards," and also come in three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
Suitable for searching tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities for bones and other internal structures.  It is made round, polished, and smooth like a whetstone, of Chinese brass, or of  asparagus-wood, or of copper, or of iron, or of silver.  The best is made of asparagus-wood.
Probes may also be made of black lead, suitable for probing fistulas that have a curved interior, since its flexibility conforms to that curve.  These are also of three types, being long, medium, and short.
According to the needs of each fistula's interior, and the thickness of the probe should be proportionate to the fistula's width and narrowness.  Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of forceps, which are numerous types.  Some are simple, with one hook; these come in large, medium, and small sizes.  Others are blind forceps, also in three types.  There are also double-hooked forceps, in three types, and curved double-hooked forceps. And there are three types.  Also, there are three-hooked forceps, in three types.  All these types require each one in its place.  Image of a large, simple forceps. Image of a medium-sized simple forceps. Image of a small simple forceps.
Image of a large blind forceps. Image of a medium-sized blind forceps.
Image of a small blind forceps.
Image of a large forceps with two hooks. Image of a medium-sized forceps with two hooks. Image of a small forceps with two hooks.
Image of a large forceps with three hooks.
Image of a medium-sized forceps with three hooks. Image of a small forceps with three hooks.
And these are images of the scalpels used to cut and dissect tissues and tumors.  There are three types, some large, some medium, and some small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium-sized scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its cutting edges are limited, and the other ends are not limited, but are made this way so that they can be used to dissect tissue when there is a fear of cutting a vein or nerve.  They are used to help the patient and give a little relief from the burning sensation experienced when removing a tumor.
And these are images of retractors.  There are three types, some large, some medium, and some small.  Image of a large retractor.
It is made from polished bronze, similar to that used for kohl.  On one end, it has a wide spoon-like shape made of two layers.  Hidden within the head is a scalpel blade, resembling a bird's tongue, that extends in and out as desired.
Images of scalpels that are inserted between the fingers when removing tumors, so the patient does not feel them.  There are three types, some large, some medium, and some small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Images of cupping instruments for drawing blood.  There are three types, some large, some medium, and some small.  Image of a large cupping instrument.
They are made of brass or bronze, slightly elongated and rounded, as you see.  Their thinness is important.  You should have these cupping instruments, both large and small, to draw blood quickly when necessary, and when medicine is unavailable.
But they should not be used to draw blood from every part of the body.  Rather, they are used on fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the leg, thigh, arm, breast, abdomen, groin, and similar moist, fleshy organs.
Other smaller instruments may be made from it, resembling pistachio shells in this form.
Blood can be drawn with these if it flows from a venesection site, or if a vein or artery is severed.  A round shape may also be made from this material.
Chapter Forty-seven.
In the treatment of the male breast.
Some people's breasts may swell during puberty, becoming like women's breasts and remaining swollen and unsightly.  If one dislikes this, one should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast, as shown in this way.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with the medicated plaster, then stitch the edges of the wound together and treat it until it heals. If the breast droops and relaxes due to its bone structure, as happens with women, treat it.
One should make two crescent-shaped incisions in its upper sides, each connecting with the other at their ends, so that the larger line encircles the smaller one, as shown in this manner. From line ~B~ to line ~C~, then the skin between the incisions is peeled away, the fat is removed, and the mentioned stitching, sutures, and necessary treatment are used until it heals.
If the incision does not encompass the necessary portion to be cut due to the patient's distress or bleeding, the wound should be packed with cotton soaked in caustic ointment, left to consume any remaining fat, and then treated until it heals.
The Forty-eighth Chapter.
On the treatment of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the swine-like type, solid and enclosed within a sac, some containing moisture.  Those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, like this.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~. If all the material from the tumor has been discharged, pack it with used cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the 'swine's knot' type, incise it as we have mentioned for incisions on swine's tumors,  If the wound becomes purulent, use cautery as previously described.
The forty-ninth chapter.
Incising the tumor that appears near the artery or vein, called an aneurysm.
If the artery is wounded and the skin above it adheres, a tumor often results.  Similarly, a vein may also develop a swelling and tumor.
The signs by which one can determine if the swelling is from an artery or a vein: if it is from an artery, the swelling is oblong, located deep in the body, and when you press it with your finger, you feel a crackling sensation.
And that which is from a vein, the swelling is round, on the surface of the body.  Incisions on these tumors are dangerous, especially in the armpit, groin, neck and many other parts of the body, and if they are very large, one should avoid treating them with iron.
Also, those in the extremities or head should be avoided.  If it is a swelling of the artery's mouth, make a longitudinal incision in the skin, then open the incision with hooks, then dissect and free the artery from the sheaths.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle beneath it and pierce it to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread at two places, as I explained to you in the ligation of the arteries in the temples.  Then puncture with a lancet the area between the ligaments, until all the blood is removed.
Then the swelling will subside, and then use a treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off.  Then treat with suitable ointments until healed.
If the swelling is from a vein rupture, then you should grasp as much of the swelling with the skin as possible. Then insert a needle below the area you grasped, piercing it and a double thread within it, until you remove it from the other side. Then tie the swelling firmly, according to what I mentioned to you regarding tying the pouch from both sides with the ends of the thread.  If you fear the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread beneath the entire swelling where the first needle crosses.
Tie your threads in four places, then cut the swelling in the middle until what is inside comes out.  Cut off any excess skin, leaving the tied portion. Then apply a poultice soaked in liquid and oil. Then use treatment with lotions and ointments until healed.
Chapter Fifty.
In the swelling that arises from nerve twisting.
Just as a swelling appears in the artery and vein, so too does a swelling appear in the nerve if struck or caused by excessive exertion, or similar.  This is most common in the wrists and ankles.
And in every location where the joints move, it is a hard swelling, similar in color to the rest of the body.  It is often without pain.  If pressed hard, the sufferer feels a sensation similar to numbness.  The swelling is not deeply embedded in the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in every direction, but does not go forward or backward.  Any swelling in the joints should not be treated with iron, for it might cause a wound.  Any swelling in the head or forehead...
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the swelling is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from the root. If it is large, suspend it with a hook, dissect it, then remove it. Close the wound with stitches and treat it until healed.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On the removal of warts that appear on the abdomen.
Warts, called fungal warts for their resemblance to fungi, often appear on the abdomen and other parts of the body. Their base is thin and their head thick; sometimes their lips are swollen.  They vary in size, from small to very large.
I observed a man with two warts on his abdomen, resembling fungi.  Their bases were thin and white, their lips swollen and cracked, and moisture constantly dripping from them. I removed them, the weight of one being approximately eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces.
If the affliction is moist, and the wart's color is white, moist, and thin-based, cut it with a broad scalpel, having a cautery iron at hand.  For frequently much blood flows when cutting them.
If blood overwhelms you, cauterize it.  If the afflicted person is afraid of the cut, take a strong lead thread, tie it tightly around the wart, and leave it for two days.  Then increase the tension of the lead thread, tightening it further.
Continue tightening until the wart breaks off and falls away of its own accord, without further effort.  If the wart has a thick base, cutting it presents some danger, particularly if located on the abdomen.  However, it might be possible to cut off half or a part of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat the wound until healed. Beware of cutting a wart that is dark, insensitive, and dull-looking, for it is a cancerous tumor.  We will discuss cancer after this.
The Fifty-Second Chapter.
In the treatment of navel growths.
Navel growths arise from various causes: either from a rupture in the abdominal peritoneum, allowing the intestines to protrude, as seen in other hernias; or from bleeding from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from trapped gas.
If it is due to a rupture in the peritoneum and the protrusion of the intestines, the tumor will be similar in color to the body, soft without pain, and will have a varied appearance. If it is due to the intestines protruding, its appearance will be even more varied than what we have described.  When you press it with your fingers, it disappears, then returns; and there may be rumbling sounds with it, and it may grow significantly larger during baths and intense exertion. If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
If it does not disappear when pressed with your hand, and does not increase or decrease, if it is due to blood, the tumor will take on a dark appearance along with these signs. If it is due to growing flesh, the tumor will be hard and firm, and will remain the same size.
If it is due to gas, its touch will be soft.  In such a case, one should refrain from treatment, as there is fear and deception involved, as I instructed you in the chapter concerning tumors that arise from arteries and veins.
If the protrusion of the navel is due to the intestines or intestines, you should instruct the patient to hold still and stand upright, then trace the outline of the entire navel with ink. Then you should instruct him to lie on his back before you.  Then, using a wide scalpel, cut around the navel at the spot marked by ink.  Then, use a large probe to lift the center of the tumor upwards.  Finally, tie the incision site with a strong thread or silk tendon in a firm manner.
The knot of the bandage should be a figure-eight knot.  Then, open the center of the constricted tumor above the bandage, insert your index finger, and feel for the intestine. If you find the bandage has caught it, loosen the figure-eight knot and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find an opening (fistula), dilate it with a probe.
And cut off any excess. If an artery or vein presents an obstacle, ligate it tightly and return to your work. Then take two needles, thread them with strong threads, and insert the needles into the incision around the tumor, having made them pierce the tissue, and then pull the tumor tightly in four places at the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the pulled flesh decays and falls off on its own, or cut it once it thins and rots. Then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If the protrusion of the navel is from growing flesh in it.
Or if it's from moisture, then you should cauterize the tumor as we said, and remove the blood or moisture you find in it.  Then treat it with what will heal the area.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have previously mentioned the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicine, and warned against using iron to treat it lest it ulcerate.  We also discussed cancer originating in the womb and warned against treating it.
The ancients stated that if the cancer is in a place where it can be completely removed, such as cancer in the breast or thigh, and similar removable organs, especially if it is small and early, then it should be completely extracted. However, if it is advanced and large, one should not approach it.
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve this.  If it is advanced, as we said, one should proceed carefully, and allow the affected person to have several episodes of black discharge, then to dissect it if there is a clear fullness in the veins.
Then, the patient should be positioned in a way that allows for work to be done.  Then, appropriate hooks should be inserted into the cancer, and it should be scraped from every side, along with the skin, thoroughly, until nothing of its origins remains.  Allow the blood to flow, do not stop it quickly.
Instead, squeeze the affected areas and remove all the thick blood with your hand or any suitable instruments.  If during the procedure, a large amount of blood is encountered due to cutting an artery or vein, cauterize the affected area until the bleeding stops and then treat it with other methods until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On the treatment of scabies.
We have informed you about the classification of dropsy, how water accumulates, the symptoms of each type, and its treatment with medicines.  Only the *zaqqi* type of dropsy is treated with iron.  The *tabbi* and *lahmi* types should never be treated with iron.
If you have treated this *zaqqi* type of scabies with medicines and your treatment has not been effective, observe whether the patient has become excessively weak or has another illness besides the scabies, such as [another unspecified illness].
If the patient has a cough, diarrhea, or similar ailments, be very careful not to treat it with iron, as it is a risk. If you see a patient who is strong, with no illness other than the scabies alone, and is neither a child nor an elderly person, then the procedure is to have the patient stand before you. And a servant behind him will squeeze his stomach with his hands, pushing the water downwards towards the groin.  Then, take a pointed lancet in this manner:
It should be narrow at both ends, long, and pointed, like a lancet, but it should have a slight curvature so as not to penetrate too deeply into the intestines and harm them.  Then, observe if the scabies originated from the intestines.
If the scabies originates from the liver, the incision should be three fingers below the navel, slightly above the pubic area.  If the scabies originates from a spleen disease, the incision should be three fingers to the right of the navel.
Also, the incision should not be on the side the patient intends to lie on, to prevent discharge from flowing to that vulnerable area. Then, pierce the skin completely with the instrument, and insert the instrument into the incision and raise your hand.
With the lancet, separate the skin from the peritoneum as if you were peeling it, and the amount you separate should be the size of a fingernail or similar. Then, pierce the peritoneum until the lancet reaches an empty space, which is the location of the water, and then drain it. Insert the instrument, which is illustrated as follows, into the hole.
It is like a thin tube made of silver, copper, or polished, smooth leather.  At the bottom is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And its tip may have a stylus-like probe, like this image/illustration.
At its upper end is a ring. When the instrument reaches the water, it immediately drains onto the instrument. Drain a moderate amount of water at this time, because if you drain more than necessary, the patient may die from the dissolution of his animal spirit.
Or he may experience a near-fatal fainting spell. However, drain it according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates—the strength of his pulse and the good color of his complexion.  Then remove the instrument and retain the water, as it will be retained at once.
Because of the skin that covers the hole in the peritoneum, which you were instructed to cover in that manner, and then you return the instrument another day if you see the patient is able to tolerate it.
Also remove a small amount of water; do this for several days while staying alert and avoiding errors so that only a small amount of water remains.  If you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, treat him with hot sand burial.
Excessive sweating in the bath and sun, enduring thirst, and treating him with dried medications until he recovers; cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as previously described.
Chapter Fifty-five.
In treating children born with unperforated or narrow or misplaced urinary passages.
Some boys may be born with their foreskin unperforated; it is necessary to perforate it from the moment of birth.
With a very thin scalpel in this manner:.
Then, insert a thin lead nail into the opening, tie it, and hold it for three or four days.  When urination is desired, remove it and then replace it. If you do not use the lead, it is possible that the urine passing through the area may cause it to close.
And as for those whose opening is narrow, they are treated with lead, as we said, for many days until it widens.  And those whose opening is in the wrong place, such as those born with the opening at the end of the foreskin, cannot urinate properly.
Until he lifts the urethra upward with his hand, and it is not born in front of him, so that the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line; this is a very ugly condition.  The procedure in this case is for the patient to lie on their back.
Then, stretch his foreskin forcefully with your left hand, and cut the tip of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, as if carving something so that its center bulges out like a foreskin, and so that the opening is in the center as it should be.
Be cautious of bleeding during your procedure, as it often occurs.  Stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-six.
Concerning the ulcer that occurs in the foreskin, glans, and darkening and decay, and the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans.
This ulcer often occurs in the urethra, a fleshy bump, and may be malignant or benign.  The benign type should be removed with a gentle snare.
Cut it completely to clean it, then apply a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment.  Thereafter, treat with palm ointment until it heals. However, if the ulcer is malignant and dark in color, cauterization should be performed after cutting and scraping it.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised male, and part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and part outside, then the ulcer inside should be removed first.  Once it has healed, then treat the external portion.
Because if you treat both at once, you risk the foreskin rupturing.  This can also occur in females, and the foreskin may show darkening and decay.  All darkened and decaying areas should be excised.
Then apply honey, crushed and sifted pomegranate rind, and kresna to it.  Treat it with other remedies until it heals.  If bleeding occurs, use a crescent-shaped cautery iron in this manner:
Cauterization is beneficial in both cases, namely bleeding and a corrupted wound.  If the fistula ulcer is completely consumed at some point, a lead tube should be inserted into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it.  Concerning the foreskin adhering to the fistula...
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin is healthy but has not been circumcised, and it may also occur due to a wound or tumor.  The foreskin should be separated with a sharp scalpel until the ligament is loosened and the fistula is separated from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish it thoroughly, a small amount of the fistula and foreskin should be separated. The foreskin is thin, so it might rupture quickly because of its thinness.  Then separate the foreskin and fistula with a thin, dampened linen cloth in cool water so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat with a styptic drink until it heals.
Chapter fifty-seven.
In cleansing boys and treating their errors.
Circumcision is nothing but separating a connection, like other surgeries. However, because it is an act performed by us, intentionally, and especially on boys, it is essential to establish the best possible procedure.
The easiest path to safety, I say, is that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced in their laws.  It is something we have acquired.
Through experience, I have found that the general practitioners and barbers use cleansing with knives and scissors, and use tongs, ligatures with thread, and cutting with a nail. I have tried all these methods.
I found nothing better than cleansing with scissors and tying with thread, because cleansing with a knife often damages the skin, since the foreskin has two layers.  Perhaps the outer layer of skin is cut, while the inner layer remains.
This leads to further cuts and renewed pain. Cleansing with tongs does not prevent cutting the end of the urethra, because it might enter its opening.  As for cleansing with a nail, the skin might tear, ruining your work, or the boy's skin may be naturally too thin.
Many are born without needing any cleansing, and I have seen this.  Cleansing with scissors and tying with thread, however, experience has shown me to be superior, because the scissors are evenly sharp, as the blade above is like the blade below.
When you squeeze your hand with the blades evenly aligned, the cut is uniform and in one stroke.  The ligature then becomes a wall to the urethra's skin from all sides, and there is no mistake. The procedure begins by first calming the boy.
Especially if he is someone who understands a little, that you are only tying the thread on his urethra and leaving it until another day, then make him happy and pleased in every way that you can, and what he accepts by reason. Then, position him upright in front of you.
Do not have him seated, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot; the boy's eyes should not see them or any of the instruments at all.  Then, insert your hand into his urethra, and inflate the skin upward until the glans of the urethra is exposed.
Then cleanse it from any impurities that gather there.  Tie the marked spot with a doubled thread.  Then tie a second ligature slightly below that.  Hold the lower ligature firmly with your thumb and forefinger, and cut between the ligatures. Then raise the skin upwards quickly and expose the glans of the urethra.  Then allow the blood to flow for a little while, as this is best for minimizing swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, and sprinkle it with the ash of burnt dry gourd, which is the best I have tried, or with fine ground charcoal dust, which is also excellent.
Then raise the skin upwards quickly and expose the glans of the urethra.  Then allow the blood to flow for a little while, as this is best for minimizing swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, and sprinkle it with the ash of burnt dry gourd, which is the best I have tried, or with fine ground charcoal dust, which is also excellent. Then place it on a poultice of a hard-boiled egg, in rosewater, mixed with a good quality, soft rose oil, and leave it on until the next day. Then continue treatment with the remaining treatments until it heals.
This is a suitable scissor design for the procedure.
The scissors should be straight, sharp, and nail-shaped.  The blades should be the same length as the handles.  A common mistake in the procedure is that the inner skin might be entirely or partially turned inward during the cut.  You should carefully pull the skin outwards with your fingernail before the area swells.
Cut it (the skin) evenly. If you cannot grasp it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days pass and the area under the glans of the urethra remains swollen, leave it until the inflammation subsides and gently excise the swelling.
Cut it according to your judgment, being careful not to cut the glans.  If any part of the glans is cut, it does not cause harm. Treat the wound using the poultices described in the chapter on poultices.
If more skin is cut than necessary and it retracts, this is also not very harmful. Treat it as described until healed.
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
On the treatment of urinary retention in the bladder.
Urinary retention in the bladder occurs due to blockage by a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or a growing piece of flesh, and the like.  If you treat this with the various treatments described in the classification.
If the urine does not flow and you suspect the obstruction is due to a stone that has harmed the neck of the bladder, the patient should be placed on their knees, then have someone sit on their back, extending their abdomen towards the back, and the patient should hold onto themselves as much as possible.
The neck of the bladder will then be forced to push the stone backward, and the urine will flow. If the urine does not flow using the method described and the patient's condition worsens, it is necessary to use a device called a catheter, of which this is a picture:.
It is made of silver, thin and smooth, hollow like a bird's feather tube, about one and a half spans long, with a gentle funnel at its head.  The method of drawing out urine with it is to take a folded thread and tie a piece of wool or cotton firmly to one end.
The thread is inserted into the lower end of the catheter, and any excess wool is trimmed with nippers so that it fits snugly within the tube, plugging it like a stopper. Then, the catheter is lubricated with oil, butter, or egg white, and the patient sits in a chair.
His bladder and urethra are lubricated with moist ointments or warm oil and water.  Then, the catheter is gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra. Then the urethra is bent upwards towards the navel, and the catheter is pushed further inside.
Once the urethra is bent, the catheter is pushed further inside until it nears the anus.  Then the penis is tilted downwards, the catheter inside it, and it is pushed until the catheter reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has reached an empty space.
This is done in this way because the passage through which the urine flows is curved.  Then, the thread with the wool is pulled gently, so the urine follows the wool, and then it is withdrawn and the urine is drained, and the catheter is reinserted.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
Images of the instruments suitable for this purpose are made of silver or carved ivory, hollowed out with a long tube, for the gentle discharge of pus.  One would wish to instill water and medicines into it using an instrument called a syringe.  Here is its image.
Made of silver or carved ivory, hollowed out with a long tube.  The entire tube is hollow except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
The hollow part where the nozzle is situated will be as big as to fit the material without exceeding it, so that if you pull something of the moist material, it will be pulled, and if you push it, it will be pushed far, as the oil-thrower used in naval warfare.
If you wish to expel moisture from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and pull upward with the nozzle. The moisture will be drawn into the syringe's hollow. Then, insert the tip into the urethra, as we described with the catheters, and push the moisture with the nozzle.
Then, that moisture will reach the bladder in a way that the patient feels it.  This is also an image of a gentle enema, used to irrigate the bladder.
Made of silver or a leather-like material, its upper head resembles a small funnel, with a groove below it that holds the cord. Then, take a camel's bladder and place the moisture you wish to inject into the bladder inside it.  Then, tie it securely between the two parts with a doubled thread.
Warm the moisture slightly over the fire. Then, insert the tip of the enema into the urethra.  Then, tightly squeeze the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of thin material, make a circle with it, and pierce it all around.  Then, insert a strong thread through those holes as you rotate it.  Then, gather the circle as you gather a table cloth, after placing the desired moisture, ointments, and water inside.
Then tie it to the apparatus and use it as you did with the bladder, squeezing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On removing stones.
We have previously described the types of stones, their treatment with medications, and the differences between kidney stones and bladder stones, along with the signs of each. We have also described stones requiring manual removal and incision.
This is particularly the case with bladder stones, and those that form in the urethra. I will describe this clearly and concisely.
I say that bladder stones most often affect boys. A sign is that the urine exiting the bladder is as thin as water.
Sand appears in it, he rubs and plays with his penis, and it often hangs down.  The anus often protrudes in many of them.  Recovery is easier in boys until they reach fourteen years of age, more difficult in the elderly, and middling in the case of young adults.
Those with larger stones have easier treatment, and the reverse is true for smaller stones.  Therefore, in treatment, the patient should first be administered an enema to remove all the impurities in his intestines, as this may prevent the detection of the stone.
Then the patient is taken by the legs, shaken, and moved downwards to bring the stone to the neck of the bladder, or he is made to jump from a high place several times.  Then, he is seated upright before you, hands under his thighs, so that the entire bladder tilts downwards, and then you examine him.
Palpate him from the outside.  If you feel the stone in the space, immediately make an incision on it. If it is not at all within your reach, then you should lubricate the index finger (if the patient is a boy) or the middle finger with grease from the left hand.
If it is a fully developed boy, insert it into his anus and search for the stone.  Once found, move it slowly towards the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it outward towards the area you intend to incise.
Tell a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and tell another servant to stretch the labia upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand, to stretch the skin below the labia towards the location of the incision.  Then, take the dissecting forceps, which has this form:
Incise between the anus and the labia, not in the middle, but on the side of the left groin. The incision should be directly over the stone. Your finger should be in the anus, pressing the stone outward in a sloping manner, so that the incision is wide from the outside and narrow from the inside, as much as possible, to allow the stone to exit.
Do not increase the pressure.  Perhaps the finger in the anus will dislodge the stone during the incision, allowing easy removal.  Understand that some stones have angles and edges, making removal difficult.
Some are smooth, like acorns, and round, making removal easy. If it has angles and edges, increase the incision slightly. If it does not come out this way, you must devise a method, either to grasp it with a strong forceps whose tip is like a rasp.
To grip the stone so it does not slip, or to insert a delicate, curved instrument underneath it.  If you cannot accomplish this, widen the incision slightly.  If any significant bleeding occurs, stop it with a cautery iron.
If there are multiple stones, first push the largest one into the bladder opening, then incise around it.  Afterward, push out the smaller stones.  Do the same if there are more than two.  If the stones are extremely large, it is foolish to make a large incision, for it exposes the patient to one of two things.
Either he will die, or he will experience constant dribbling of urine because the area will never heal properly.  However, attempt to push them out, or devise a method to break them with forceps until they are expelled.
Once your work is complete, dress the wound with kender, sabr, sheyan, and strong bandages.  Place over it a compress moistened with oil and a drink, or rose ointment and cool water to soothe the hot swelling.  Then, the patient should lie on their back, and do not remove the bandages until the third day.
Once the swelling subsides, bathe the area with plenty of water and oil.  Then treat it with palm ointment and basil ointment until healed. If there is excess swelling, inflammation, or similar issues in the wound—for example, if blood clots in the bladder and urination is blocked, and this is recognized by the presence of blood in the urine—
Insert your finger into the wound and remove the blood.  If it remains, it will lead to the corruption and infection of the bladder. Then, wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type with its corresponding remedy until healed.
Throughout the treatment period, the thighs should be bound together to secure the medications applied to the area. If the stone is small and has lodged in the urethra, causing inflammation and blockage of urination, treat it with the methods I have described before it reaches the rupture.
Often, this treatment obviates the need for incision. I have tried it; it involves taking a small, steel probe, shaped as follows:
The tip of the probe is sharp and pointed, attached to a stick. Then, a thread is used to tie the penis below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder. The probe is then gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the probe slightly against the stone, gradually, until it pierces it from the other side. Urine will flow immediately. Then, press with your hand on any remaining stone outside the penis; it will break up and pass out with the urine. The patient will recover.
If this treatment proves impossible due to an obstacle, tie a thread below the stone and another above it. Then, make an incision on the stone within the penis, between the threads, and remove it.
Then, loosen the threads and cleanse the coagulated blood from the wound.  The thread was tied below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other above to ensure that when the thread is loosened after the stone is removed, the skin will return to its place and cover the wound.
Therefore, when tying the upper thread, you should pull the skin upwards so that it returns to its place and covers the wound, as we have said.
Chapter Sixty-One.
On removing stones in women.
Stones rarely develop in women.  If one of them presents with a stone, treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons.  One is that the woman may be a virgin, and the other that you will not find a woman who will allow herself to be examined by the physician.
If she is a chaste woman or one with close relatives, the third reason is that you won't find a woman skilled in this craft, especially the manual work involved.  The fourth reason is that the opening to the stone in women is far from the position of the stone, requiring a deep incision.
In this case there is danger.  If necessity demands it, one should seek a skilled female physician, though such are rare.  If one is not available, seek a virtuous and reliable male physician, or bring in a skilled female midwife or one who has some knowledge of this craft.
Bring her in and instruct her to examine the stone first.  If the woman is a virgin, insert a finger into her vagina to search for the stone. If found, press it against the finger.
If she is not a virgin, but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it firmly.
If she finds it, she should gently guide it from the opening of the bladder downwards, as far as possible, until it reaches the root of the thigh. Then, she should make the incision at the midpoint of the vagina, near the root of the thigh, whichever side feels the stone to be present.
Her finger should remain pressing on the stone, and the incision should be made small at first. Then, introduce the forceps into the small incision. If she feels the stone, increase the incision as needed to remove the stone.  Know that there are many types of stones.
There are small and large stones, smooth and rough, long and round, and those with branches. Know their types so you can determine what you want. If blood flows excessively, sprinkle powdered alum on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then resume your work.
Until the stone is removed, prepare the instruments mentioned for removing stones in men to assist in your work. If excessive bleeding occurs and you know the bleeding originates from a severed artery, apply styptics to the area.
Tighten the styptics firmly and leave them in place. Do not remove them. Leave the stone and do not remove it, for the patient may die. Then treat the wound. If the intensity of bleeding subsides after a few days and the area becomes infected, resume your work until the stone is expelled.
Chapter Sixty-two.
In the cleft of the water ducts.
Watery ducts are a collection of moisture in the white peritoneum which lies beneath the scrotum's skin surrounding the testicle. This is called the scrotum. It may also be in a special membrane, which nature has prepared on one side of the testicle.
So that it may be thought to be another testicle. It is situated between the scrotal skin and the white peritoneum, which we have mentioned. This only occurs rarely. These ducts arise from weakness affecting the testicles; this material may also be caused by injury to the testicles.
This moisture has various colours: it may be yellowish, or blood-red, or dark-greyish-black, or whitish and watery – which is the most common. The signs by which it is recognised are:
Where the water collects, if it is in the white peritoneum we mentioned, the swelling will be somewhat elongated and round, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle will not be apparent, because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a separate membrane, the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle.
Therefore, one might imagine it to be another testicle.  If the moisture is between the scrotal skin and the white peritoneum, then it can be felt.  To determine the colour of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe, whose image we have previously described.  Judge its colour by what comes out in the probe's path.
If we proceed to treatment with the lancet, the patient should be bled, if possible, and if you see the body is full, then the patient should lie on their back on something slightly elevated, with many cloths placed beneath, and you should sit on their left side.
Have a servant sit on their right, extending the patient's penis to one side of the scrotal skin, toward the flank. Then take a broad scalpel and make a longitudinal incision in the scrotal skin, from the center, down towards the pubic area.
The incision should be made straight, parallel to the line dividing the scrotal skin in half, until you reach the white peritoneum.  Carefully dissect this, avoiding cutting it.  Focus your dissection on the side closest to the testicle, and dissect as thoroughly as possible.
Then, widen the incision in the water-filled peritoneum and remove all the water.  Then, separate the edges of the incision with forceps, and pull the peritoneum upward, avoiding the scrotal skin.  Cut the peritoneum however you can, either entirely or in pieces.
Especially the thin side; if you don't thoroughly cut it, there is a risk that the fluid will return.  If the testicle protrudes from its covering while you are working, return it to its place after you have finished cutting the peritoneum, then stitch the edges of the scrotal skin together.
Then treat it as you would any other surgical wound until it heals.  If the testicle is already damaged by another condition, tie off the vessels supporting it to prevent bleeding, then detach the testicle from its supporting structure and remove the testicle. Then treat it as described above.
If there is fluid accumulated on both sides, understand that it is a double hydrocele.  Incise the other side in the same way as the first. If you prefer a single procedure, do so. Then wipe away the blood.
Insert wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions.  Place another layer of wool soaked in a mixture of liquid and oil over the testicles and the abdominal area.  Then lay a folded cloth (the *rafā'id*) on top. Tie it down with a six-sided bandage, like this:
Then, take two cloths, stitch them together, and fill them with fluffy wool, in this manner.  Make the straps to fasten them with damp cotton or wool.  Tie them together, tightly, with a belt. One of the straps should go from the buttocks to the back.
The second strap should go towards the pubic area, and the other two should go down the thighs, and the remaining two down the upper thighs.  Tie all the straps together with a belt.  This hydrocele can also be treated with cauterization instead of incision with a sharp instrument.
This involves using a gentle, heated scalpel to incise the scrotum until the white membrane containing the water is exposed.  Take another cauterizing instrument in this fashion:
It resembles a Greek eye; then cauterize the membrane with this, while hot, until all the moisture is expelled.  Then, grasp the membrane with forceps and cauterize the surrounding layer, cutting it as best as you can to remove all of it, while avoiding burning the testicle.
Know that this method is safer and avoids blood loss, and better than the incision method.  If during the incision or cauterization, a burning swelling or blood flow, or anything else, occurs, you should treat whatever arises with the appropriate remedies, as previously described.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot tolerate this procedure due to its unpleasantness, then use cauterization as described; and if this is confirmed by the evidence presented before.
If the swelling is watery, the patient should sit on a high chair.  Then, cauterize the swelling below with a wide probe.  Make the cauterization lengthwise along the body, and make the opening wide enough for all the water to drain.  Then apply cotton to the area and bandage it.
Allow the remaining water to drain, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not drain during the cauterization, it is likely because the white membrane is obstructing the opening of the wound, preventing the water from exiting.
In that case, you should insert a goose quill, or the instrument used to extract the water of the beloved (whose image was previously shown), or slightly enlarge the opening of the wound.
Know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so.  If it accumulates, cauterize it in the same manner, and the patient should observe his/her days (i.e., rest).
Sixty-third chapter.
Concerning the laceration of fleshy tissues and their treatment.
Know that laceration of these fleshy tissues is often a perilous condition leading to death.  Therefore, we advise against interfering with it, and for the safety of the patient.  However, I am about to describe the treatment and the types of tumors associated with it.
I say that many tumors may occur in the bodies composed of tissues of the same kind.  This arises from various causes, either from excessive heat directed towards the tissues, or from injury. The tumor's color is the same as the body's color, and there is no water present.
The tumor is firm, and it may be hardened, its color like mud, and it is insensitive. It may also result from the entanglement and swelling of arteries, as previously mentioned, or from the swelling of veins.  If it is from the swelling of the arteries, this can be identified by the dissipation of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be interfered with at all.  However, if it arises from the swelling of veins, nothing will dissipate when pressed with the fingers. This type may be lacerated, and so may other flesh.
This is done by incising the scrotum, then pulling the testicle upward, and removing it from the white peritoneum.  The attachments are separated from the vessels, the vessels are tied off, and the attachments are cut after being freed on all sides of the testicle.  If the testicle has adhered to these growing tissues.
Then the testicle should be removed and cut.  If the adhesion is between parts of the peritoneum or between vessels, then all such adhesion should be freed and cut in a circular fashion.
If the growth of flesh is in the place of adhesion, which is behind, then all of it should be cut, and the testicle removed, as we have said.  When your work is complete, dress the wound with wet wool in rose-oil and drink, then treat it with all the other treatments until it heals.
Sixty-fourth chapter.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy associated with elephantiasis.
Elephantiasis is a twisted swelling, resembling a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the limbs.  It hinders the afflicted person from movement, exercise, and walking. In treating this ailment, the treatment is similar to what has been mentioned previously.
However, it is necessary to mention the treatment as done by the ancients.  I say that the afflicted person should sit on a high chair, then pull the affected limbs downward, and then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, near the vessels that are close to the penis.
A servant of yours should hold it (the skin) and pull it strongly. Then, with a broad, sharp scalpel, make a slanted incision alongside the vessels until the vessels are exposed.  Then, peel it from every side, as I have described to you in the case of the arteries in the temples.  Then, insert a needle with a double-threaded string into it.
Tie it (the string) at the first place where the elephantiasis appeared, and also at its end.  Then, make a straight incision along the body in the middle, and remove the foul, putrid humours that have collected there.
Then treat the wound like other wounds that need time to heal, so that the vessels that feed the affected limb will fall away. There is no harm in that. If the elephantiasis affects all the vessels, then one limb must be removed with the vessels so that the egg does not lack nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, it will wither and be useless.
Chapter Sixty-five.
On the treatment of intestinal obstruction.
This obstruction occurs when a fissure appears in the peritoneum extending across the abdomen, near the groin.  The intestines protrude from that hernia into one of the limbs.
This hernia arises either from a fissure in the peritoneum or from its extension.  These two types result from various causes, such as a blow, a leap, a shout, or lifting a heavy object, and the like.  If it's from an extension of the peritoneum, the hernia develops gradually over a long period.
It does not appear suddenly.  If it is from the extension, the swelling gradually extends to a certain depth, because the peritoneum is constricting the intestines. If it arises from a fissure in the peritoneum, there is initially intense pain immediately, and the swelling is distinctly visible beneath the skin nearby.
The intestines protrude and exit the peritoneum.  Feces may also exit, and this obstruction is then termed intestinal and fecal.  It may also contain air.  The intestines may also contain stagnant matter, which causes the patient's demise.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially if constricted.  The treatment for these conditions using iron is risky; therefore, one should be cautious.  The procedure is to instruct the patient to push the intestines back into the abdominal cavity with their hand if it is possible to return them.
Then, the patient lies supine, with their legs raised.  Then, the skin around the groin is stretched upward, and the entire scrotum is incised lengthwise.  Hooks are inserted into the edges of the incision as much as needed to widen the opening.
The incision should be wide enough to allow the testicle to emerge.  Then, the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin is peeled back until the white, tough peritoneum is exposed on all sides.  Then, insert your index finger next to the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum underneath the testicle's skin and the second peritoneum, detach the adhesions behind the testicle.  Then, use your right hand to pull inward on the scrotal skin.  At the same time, use your left hand to pull the white peritoneum upward and lift the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision.
Instruct the assistant to pull the testicle upward.  You should fully detach the adhesions behind it.  Examine with your finger to ensure there is no twisted bowel within the tough white peritoneum. If you find any, push it back into the abdomen below.
Then, take a needle with a thick, ten-stranded thread.  Insert it at the edge of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin, near the incision.  Then cut the ends of the thread so that only four strands remain. Then, join the strands together tightly.  Tie the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin tightly on both sides with this.  Wrap the ends of the threads tightly as well, so that nothing can reach the nourishing vessels. So that a hot swelling does not appear.  Tie a second ligature, outside the first, at least two fingerbreadths away.  After these two ligatures, leave a portion of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin the size of a finger's breadth.
So that a hot swelling does not appear.  Tie a second ligature, outside the first, at least two fingerbreadths away.  After these two ligatures, leave a portion of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin the size of a finger's breadth. Cut the rest of it (the peritoneum) in a circle and remove the testicle.  Then, make a cut beneath the scrotal skin that bleeds and oozes, as described previously.  Use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and apply the ligature as described.
The white peritoneum, after being cut, may require cauterization to prevent bleeding, as this often happens.  Leave the ligature until it falls off naturally.  If it is slow to fall off, then apply warm water and anything that causes perspiration to encourage its removal.
Then treat the wound with the usual treatment for surgical wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-six.
In this type of spasmodic colic, I have seen no one dare to treat it with iron.  The ancients advised, as described in colic with a hernia, to tie the vessels gently after incision below.
Then, an incision is made in the center, and the swelling is treated to open it, until the vessels fall out. The wound is treated as previously described until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-six.
In the hernia of the groin.
A hernia in the groin may appear, as we said, but no portion of the intestines descends into the groin. If any descends, it is slight and returns at all times.
However, if it persists for a long time, the opening in the peritoneum increases, so that the intestines and the testicle descend into the scrotum. This is due to the extension of the peritoneum in the groin, as we said. This is because the peritoneum stretches, then relaxes and protrudes the area.  Treatment is by cautery, as its description has been given before.
Treatment may also be with an iron, in this manner: the patient lies on their back before you, then you make a transverse incision in the swollen, protruding hernia, about the width of three fingers, and then you cauterize the peritoneum beneath the skin.
Until the white peritoneum beneath is exposed, then take a strip, place it over the protruding peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then stitch the two protruding parts of the peritoneum onto the end of the strip, and join one to the other with stitches.
Then pull the end of the strip, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, and do not touch the testicle or anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernias. Then treat it with the treatment of surgical incisions.
When the threads are cut, clean it and bandage the wound until it heals.  Then the peritoneum contracts, and the hernia protrusion will not increase.
This is the best method in this location, because it is closest to safety.
Chapter Sixty-Eight.
On the relaxation of the scrotum's skin.
The scrotum's skin often relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, and this makes the appearance unsightly.  Therefore, whoever wishes to treat this should lay the patient on their back.
He should cut all the relaxed skin from the tough skin, then bring the edges together.  If you wish, first stitch the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, secure the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the usual treatment for other wounds until it heals and the stitches come out.
Sixty-ninth chapter.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, I should not have mentioned it in this book, but I did so for two reasons: one to be knowledgeable in medicine when asked about it, and to know how to treat those who are affected by it, and the other because we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as sheep, oxen, and cats, and similar animals; I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by incision and cutting.  For that which is done by crushing, the method is that we seat the animal in hot water until its testicles relax and soften and hang down.
Then you crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer discernible to the touch.  As for castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the ligaments, and make a single incision on each testicle.
Until the testicles protrude, then cut them after having peeled them, leaving no peritoneum on them except the thin peritoneum which is over the vessels.  This type of castration is better than that which is done by crushing.
Because crushing might leave some of the testicles, and the animal will desire mating.  Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
In the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two types. One appears as a space or a scrotum with a form like a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may drip from the scrotum.
In women, there is one type, located above the vulva on the pubic bone, like small, protruding male testicles. One of them is like a man's penis, and both are like female genitalia. Treatment for these three types.
The two types of men and the single type of women, those superfluous tissues must be cut away, then treated with the usual surgical care until healed. As for the second type of men from whom urine issues from the scrotum, there is no work to be done, and no cure at all.
Chapter Seventy-one.
In the cutting of the clitoris and the protruding flesh of women's vulva.
The clitoris may increase beyond the natural size, becoming unsightly and disfigured. In some women, it may enlarge to the point of resembling a male organ, interfering with sexual intercourse.
One should grasp the excess clitoris with one's hand or forceps and cut it off, but one should not make the cut too deep, especially not into the root, so as to avoid excessive bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical remedies until it heals. As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the uterus, filling it.
And it may extend outward, like a tail. Therefore, some early physicians called it the "tail" disease.  It should be cut off, like the clitoris, and treated until healed.
Chapter Seventy-two.
On the treatment of ruptures.
A rupture is when a woman's vulva is either not pierced or the piercing is small, and it may be either natural, from birth, or accidental.  An accidental rupture may be from a prior ailment, and it may be due to excessive, newly grown flesh.
Or from thin or thick peritoneum, located either deep within the uterus, or along its sides, or at its top or bottom.  It prevents intercourse, childbirth, and possibly menstruation.  A midwife can determine this by observation.
If the obstruction is visible and near, but if it is not visible, then she should examine it with her fingers or with a probe. If the obstruction is from thin peritoneum and near the labia, then promptly pierce it; this involves making a kind of flap on the labia, then placing both thumbs on them.
The woman should lie on her back with her legs spread, then forcefully stretch the labia until the thin peritoneum is pierced and the obstruction opens.  Then, she should take wool soaked in oil and place it on the area. The woman should be cohabited with every day, so the area does not close again.
If the peritoneum is thick and dense, it should be cut with a wide scalpel, similar to a leaf-shaped blade. If the obstruction is from newly grown flesh, grasp it with forceps and cut it.  Have remedies to stop bleeding without cauterization, such as qaqia, sheyan, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so the wound does not heal quickly. Hold it for several days and use a thread of dry linen. Then treat it with the standard treatment for abscesses until it heals.  Other growths of flesh may appear in the uterus, and these should be cut in the same way.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, the cancerous tumor that occurs in the uterus should not be treated with iron at all.
Chapter Seventy-three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that appear on the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the veins' openings, to the point of constant profuse bleeding. If hemorrhoids progress, they become warts.  Their types and signs were mentioned in the classification, and we will mention them here.
Concerning those that can and cannot be treated: I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep within the uterus and do not present to the touch, have no treatment with iron.  Those that are in the opening of the uterus, where the touch can reach them, are the ones that can be treated.
The woman should enter a cool room, then scrape the warts with a lancet or a rough cloth and cut them from their roots.  Then, when blood flows from one of the blood-stopping instruments, without pricking, apply it to them.
Such as qaqia, shiyan, and frankincense, and similar things. Then elevate her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If bleeding continues, seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, and astringents, and similar things.  Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar.
Apply it as a poultice to her back. If the bleeding stops, do so; otherwise, continue with the strong leeches on the chest and breasts, without restrictions. Then take wool, dip it in the juice of thorns or the juice of a shepherd's purse or the juice of the branches of liquorice with a drink of astringents, and apply it to the affected area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals.  As for the red sore, it resembles the heads of warts, rough in appearance.  It should be cut off, as described for warts, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the treatment of abscesses that appear in the uterus.
Many types of tumors can occur in the uterus, such as cancer, hardened tumors, ulcers, gangrene, cancerous ulcers, polyps, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and inflammatory tumors.  All of these diseases and their types and signs have been mentioned in the classification.
Therefore, in this section, we must discuss the inflammatory tumor that appears in the uterus, if it is one of the tumors that accumulate over time. How should it be treated with iron?  You must consider: if the pain of the tumor is initially severe, accompanied by throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
If you see it (the tumor) red, and if it is sensitive to touch, do not rush to treat it. Treat it with what aids maturation until these symptoms subside.  Then, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats, leaning on her back.
And she should bring her legs towards the lower abdomen, with her thighs spread apart. Her arms should be placed under her knees and tied with a suitable bandage.
Then, the midwife should sit on the right side and use the instrument to open the cervix, a depiction of which will follow later.  When using this instrument, you must estimate the depth of the woman's uterus to ensure that what enters the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
For if the instrument is too deep, it will harm the patient.  Therefore, pads should be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the uterine depth.  The coil that runs within the instrument must be positioned from the upper side.
While you hold the instrument, the attendant should rotate the coil until the cervix opens. If the abscess is visible and soft, easily felt by hand, it should be incised at its head with a broad scalpel. If all the pus is discharged.
A soft wick dipped in rose oil or green oil with some astringent should be placed in the wound.  The wick should extend out from the incision in the cervix.  Pure wool soaked in boiled baker's water should be applied externally, over the uterus and pubis.
Then, treat with the appropriate ointment for two days until healed.
The uterus and wound may be washed by injecting water and honey, then water boiled with the root of sassafras or long wormwood.  Then, return to the ointment, if the abscess is hidden and within the uterus.
Iron should not be used to treat it, but it should be treated as described in the classification.
Chapter seventy-five.
On teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses that emerge in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the natural form of childbirth.  Its signs include:  when the woman stretches downwards, desires to smell the air, and finds her postpartum state less burdensome.
If the birth of the fetus is swift, know that this birth is natural, with the head emerging first, and the placenta either with it or hanging from its umbilical cord.  If you see these signs, then you should massage her abdomen to facilitate the quick expulsion of the fetus.
If it descends head-first, the placenta descends with it, and is cleansed well of impurities.  Any birth other than this is unnatural and reprehensible, as the fetus may emerge with its legs, or with its arms and legs before its head.
One arm or one leg, or its head and an arm, or it emerges folded, or perhaps it turns upside down, and other such reprehensible forms.  The midwife should be skillful and gentle with all these things, and avoid errors and mistakes.
I am showing every form of this, and how to manage it, so that you will recognize it and understand it. If the fetus emerges head-first, in the natural manner, and the woman experiences difficulty and pain, and you see her strength weakening, then have her sit on a chair, and instruct women to restrain her.
Compress her uterus with boiled herbs and moist ointments. Then the midwife should insert a small scalpel between her fingers, and cut the placenta, or cut it with her fingernail, so that the moisture within it flows out, and massage the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman should be injected with licorice juice mixed with shellac ointment.  Then, after the injection, she should be encouraged to cough and sneeze using a nasal syringe, and hold her mouth and nose. The fetus will emerge shortly. If the fetus's arms emerge first, gently return them little by little.
If entry is not possible, place the woman on a platform, raising her legs upward. Then shake the platform on the ground, while the woman holds on to prevent falling during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the remaining fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and gently pull them.  It will come out.  If the fetus emerges on its feet, push the feet upward, then turn the fetus gradually until it is straight, then take one of the feet and gently extend it.
If they emerge to the thighs, instruct her to cough and sneeze with a nasal syringe; it will come out.  If it does not come out as described, gently reposition the fetus until it is in its natural form.  It will then emerge smoothly. If it remains stubbornly resistant to all of these methods, ...
Take the juice of *Al-Khatmi*, licorice juice, and shellac ointment, and gum dissolved in a mortar.  Grind them well.  Then apply this mixture to the woman's vulva and lower abdomen.  Then have her sit in lukewarm water until the thighs are reached.
If you see that it has softened below, make a poultice of myrrh and apply it.  If she keeps it on for an hour, have her sit on a chair, then sneeze her and block her mouth and nose, and gently squeeze her lower abdomen.  The fetus will emerge immediately.  The fetus will come out on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, gently insert your hands, then have the woman lie on her back, with her legs dangling downwards, lying on a bed, and her hands clasped together. Then, gently press on her upper abdomen. Then remove the cushions from beneath her legs so that they are positioned low. If the fetus does not emerge, grasp both her legs and move them vigorously.  Then press gently above the thighs until the fetus rises.  Then the midwife should insert her hand and gently reshape the fetus.
Tell the woman to strain until the fetus emerges. The fetus will emerge sideways, with one arm dangling.  Gently attempt to reposition the arm. If you cannot, stand the woman up and have her walk.  If she cannot walk, have her lie down.
Shake her legs vigorously.  Then use the ointment that I described from the saliva. If it is delivered this way, have her sit on a chair, then work to reposition the arm and straighten the fetus.  Have the woman sneeze and tell her to strain until it emerges.
The fetus emerges on its back, arms outstretched, face toward the mother's back.  The midwife should grasp the fetus's arm and gently turn and straighten it.  Once straightened, apply the fat and saliva as we described.
Then tell her to move slowly.  When she does, have her sit on a chair and instruct her to lean to the right side.  Then tell her to strain and sneeze her with the kuṇḍas (a type of instrument). This will cause it to emerge. The fetus will emerge upright on its side.
If it descends into the cervix in this manner with the placenta, slit the placenta with your fingernail until it is free of moisture. If it is attached to the face or neck of the fetus, sever it from the navel so it does not suffocate and die. Then push the fetus inward until it is in the proper position.
Tell the woman to strain repeatedly, and it will emerge easily.  The birth of twins or multiple fetuses: Know that twins are frequently born, and sometimes three or four may be born and live, but this is rare.  As for five, it is unnatural and they will not live at all.
And they are surrounded by a single placenta, even if numerous.  They are separated by a membrane partition attached to the navel of each.  They may emerge like a single fetus, in a natural, easy birth, or they may emerge in a difficult birth, as we have described.
If any of them have difficulty during birth and become in the unnatural forms that we have mentioned, treat them as we have described.  Let the midwife be gentle, and act with patience and cunning in any form, by whatever means seem appropriate to achieve safety.
There are concepts of fetuses in the womb which may be aborted: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived.  It is true that I have heard that one woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all conceived.
By the decree of the Exalted and Knowing, all this should be within the knowledge of the midwife, for perhaps such a case may occur to her someday, and she should deal with it appropriately.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
In the extraction of the dead fetus.
If, treating the dead fetus with the methods described in the division of treatment, it does not emerge and the situation necessitates manual intervention, then one should observe. If the woman is strong and healthy, with no signs of complications that might cause harm, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
And her head should be tilted downwards, and her legs raised, with an attendant holding her at both sides, or tying her to the bed, so that her body does not shift when the fetus is drawn out.
Then, the mouth of her uterus is moistened with moist ointments, along with the saliva of the *khatmi* flower, fenugreek, and flaxseed.  Then the midwife anoints her hand with these ointments and saliva.  Then, gently, she inserts it into the uterus, seeking a place to insert the hooks from the fetus, in suitable locations.
Observe; if the fetus is positioned to descend head-first, insert the hooks into its eyes, or nape, or mouth, or palate, or under its chin, or collarbone, or near the ribs, or under the clavicles.
And if it is descending feet-first, then in the pubis and the middle ribs.  One should hold the hook with the right hand, its curve between the fingers of the left hand.  The hand should be gently inserted and a hook should be implanted in one of those locations we have mentioned.
Until it reaches an empty space, then another or a third hook is implanted opposite it, if needed, so that the pulling is even and does not tilt towards one side. Then, the pulling should be even and not just in a straight line, but moved to each side.
So that it comes out easily, as is done with a tooth when extracting it.  And in between, the pulling should be relaxed if it is obstructed in a direction.  Then the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with the ointment and insert them from the side to turn what is stuck. If part of the fetus comes out, the hooks are moved to other locations.
She does this slightly higher until the entire fetus is expelled. If a hand comes out before the rest and cannot be returned due to compression, then it should be wrapped in a cloth and pulled until, when it is all out, it is cut.
Either at the wrist joint or the elbow.  This should be done similarly for the other hand and feet.  If the fetal head is large, and faces pressure during its exit or has accumulated water in its head, then a pointed, narrow knife should be inserted between the fingers.
With it, the head is cut open so that the water comes out, or it is forcefully opened using the instrument called the *mashdakh*, which is depicted with the images of the other instruments in the following chapter.
Similarly, if the fetus is naturally large-headed, the skull should be cut open or cracked with the *mashdakh*, as we said, and then the bones removed with the forceps. If the head emerges and is compressed at the collarbone, it should be cut open so that the moisture in the chest drains out.
Then the chest will adhere. If the chest does not adhere and the extraction is not possible, then make a cut as best as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or has a tumor, it should be incised to allow the moisture to drain out.
If the fetus is on its feet, pulling it and aligning it toward the cervix is easy. If it is compressed against the abdomen or chest, it should be pulled using a cloth wrapped around your hand, and the abdomen or chest should be cut open to allow the contents to drain.
If the rest of the organs have been removed and the head has retracted and become lodged, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the cervix is open, the hand should be inserted into the neck of the uterus, searching for the head and pulling it with the fingers toward the cervix. Then, a hook or two hooks should be inserted and used to pull it out.
If the cervix has closed due to a hot tumor, it should not be forced. Instead, application of emollient liquids and bandages should be used, and sitting in relaxing, moist water.
If the fetus is on its side, if alignment is possible, use the methods described for a live fetus. If alignment is not possible, it should be cut and removed.  Nothing of the placenta should be left inside.  Once you are finished with the treatment, use the methods described for treating hot tumors in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, she should sit in constricting water and use other remedies.  I have observed a woman who conceived, then the fetus died inside her, and she conceived again afterward.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a tumor appeared in her womb, swelling until it opened and discharged pus.  I was summoned to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal.  I then applied some strong, astringent ointment.
Then a bone came out of the area, and after several days, another bone emerged.  I was astonished by this, as the abdomen is not a location for bone.  I surmised that these were bones of the dead fetus, and I examined the wound, removing numerous bones from the fetal skull.
I continued this process until I extracted many bones, and the woman was in the best of health.  She lived for a time with a slight discharge of pus from the area.  I have presented this unusual case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts to accomplish through his hands in the treatment.
Chapter Seventy-seven.
It contains images of the instruments needed for the extraction of the fetus.
Image of a spiral for opening the cervix.
This is the binder with which books are bound. It has two spirals at the ends of the wooden boards.  However, this spiral should be more delicate than the binder and should be either ebony or boxwood. The width of each board should be two finger-widths.
Their edges are about a finger's width, and their length is one and a half spans.  In the middle of the boards are two pegs made of the same wood. Their length is half a span or slightly more, and their width is about two fingers or slightly more.  These pegs.
They are the two that enter the cervix to open it when you turn the spirals.  Image of another tool for the same purpose, more delicate and lighter.
Made of ebony or boxwood, shaped like tongs, but with two pegs at the end, as you see. The length of each peg is about a span, and their width is two fingers.  If you want to open the cervix with it...
Then, place the woman on a bed with her legs spread apart, and insert these two pegs, together, into the cervix.  Hold the end of the tool between her legs, below. Then, open your hand with the tool, just as you would with tongs, as much as you want to open the cervix. So that the midwife may do what she wants.  Image of another spiral mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument for dislodging the fetus.
Image of the instrument used to crush the fetal head.
It resembles scissors, with teeth at the tip, as you see.  It can also be made rectangular, like tongs, in this form, as you see.  It has teeth like a saw's teeth, used to cut and tear.
Image of another instrument.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so that it does not break when pulling the fetus with it.  Image of a two-pronged hook.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more types there are and the better they are made by the craftsman, the quicker the work and the greater the esteem among people.  Do not disdain any instrument; it may be needed.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In removing the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, the woman should be instructed to hold herself, then have her sneezed at with the instrument, and press your hand over her mouth and nostrils.  If it comes out this way, well and good; otherwise, use a suitable amount (of force).
Pierce a hole in the covering and place in it herbs that open the cervix, such as fennel, chamomile, dill, marjoram, rue, and costmary—any or all of these remedies.  Soak them in water, heat them over a fire, and then place a silver tube over the hole in the covering's opening, and the other end in the cervix.
Hold it until the vapor reaches the bottom of the uterus, and then make her sneeze as mentioned previously.  Then, if the placenta comes out quickly, well and good. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in the grease of a she-goat or the saliva of the hyacinth.
Then, she inserts it into the vagina and searches for the placenta.  If she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out gradually, little by little. If it is stuck deep in the uterus, insert the hand as described until she finds the placenta, and then pull it out slowly and gently.
So that the uterus does not fall out from pulling too hard, it should be gently moved to the sides, right and left. Then, increase the amount of pulling, and it will respond and free itself from the adhesion. If the cervix is closed, we have described the treatment with sneezing, the pot treatment, and herbs.
If it does not come out with all the methods described, avoid force when pulling it again. Instead, tie what has come out to the woman's thigh near the cervix, and then inject her with the four-ingredient ointment.  It will cause it to decay after a few days.
It will dissolve and come out. However, if it decays, a foul odor will rise from it to the stomach and head, harming the patient.  Therefore, appropriate fumigation should be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients tried the smoke of frankincense and dried figs.  The image of the device used to fumigate the woman when menstruation and the placenta are retained, and similar cases.
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or of copper. The narrow end is placed near the vulva, and the wide end over the fire. Incense is placed on the embers, held until it dissipates, and then more is added.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
In the treatment of the unperforated anus.
Many boys are born with unperforated anuses, often blocked by a thin membrane.  The midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger, or else pierce it with a sharp lancet, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then place cotton soaked in wine and oil on it, and treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear that it will close again, insert a lead tube into the opening for many days and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
The anus may also be blocked by a healed wound or a tumor.  It is necessary to dissect this healed tissue, then treat it with the remedies mentioned, and with cauterization.
Chapter Eighty.
On treating corns that occur on the soles.
Corns that occur on the soles are a thickening and hardening that occurs near the anus, externally or within the surrounding space on one or more sides.
If this thickening persists, it may open and discharge a whitish watery fluid or thin pus.  Some of these corns may be perforated to the rectum or intestines.  Those that are not perforated will be recognizable by what comes out of them with stool and wind when using the laxative.
Sometimes worms may emerge from them.  Some corns, if located in the surrounding space, may be perforated to the bladder and urethra.  They may also be perforated to the hip joint and tailbone.  The perforated corn that reaches the anus is also distinguishable from the non-perforated kind.
Insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe, made of copper or iron, into the corn if there is no bend in it.  If there is a bend, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair on your finger. If you don't feel it at all, and no stool, wind, or worms emerge from the opening, as we have mentioned, know that it is not perforated, and proceed with treatment.
If the corn is perforated to the bladder or urethra, the sign is the discharge of urine from it, and the inability of the area to heal with medication.  If it is perforated to the hip joint or tailbone, the sign is the probe reaching those areas.
If there is no bending towards the bone, and pain is present in a particular area, and pus constantly emerges from it, and no treatment works and it does not heal with ointment, then these perforated corns have no cure.
Treating them is a futile effort for those physicians who are ignorant, while those that are not perforated and not chronic, hope for healing with iron as I describe and have experienced.  This involves placing the patient on their back before you.
Raise his legs, with his thighs tilted towards his stomach. Then insert a copper or lead probe, if there is a bend in the corn, so you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, you should then insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe has pierced through your finger, clear and without feeling any skin or flesh between your finger and the probe, then know for certain that it is perforated.  Do not exhaust yourself on it, as there is no cure, as we have said.
Some claim it heals in rare cases.  A treatment that may be helpful is to heat a thin cauterizing iron to a size appropriate for the corn, as previously mentioned, and insert it into the corn until it reaches near the anus.  Then repeat this two or three times.
So that you know that all the excess congealed flesh, similar to a bird's feather tube, has been burned.  Then treat it with a thread soaked in clarified butter until that burned flesh is removed.  Then treat it with healing ointments, if it heals.
Otherwise, it will not heal with any other treatment.  If you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh or membrane between it and the probe, and you see the corn below the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the corn. As you make the incision with the probe inside the corn, continue until the incision reaches where the tip of the probe ends, and the probe is removed and falls out.  Then clean out that congealed flesh, which resembles a bird's feather tube, leaving nothing of it behind.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals.  If blood prevents you from completing your work of removing that flesh, the best and quickest remedy is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two beneficial outcomes: burning away the excess flesh.
And cut away the blood and dry the moisture, then treat it with a thread soaked in clarified butter or sulfur powdered with oil until the area becomes purulent and that burned flesh is expelled in the pus.  Then treat the wound at that point with healing ointments that promote the growth of firm flesh.
These are the remedies that have a binding and drying effect.  If it is repaired, it has healed, and there is no need to return. If the corn has reached the depths of the rectum and is distant from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and search with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it there is a membrane or flesh, and it is close to passing through, then there is no work to be done other than by way of hope and expectation.  That is to say, you must use one of three methods: either cauterize it, as we have said.
Or to cut it until you reach its bottom to enable the thread and treatment to reach it closely. Do not proceed with the cutting too far, so as not to sever the surrounding muscle of the rectum and cause involuntary bowel movements. Then treat it as we have mentioned, for perhaps it will heal, as we have said.
Or to pierce that membrane and puncture it after cutting it close to the rectum, as we said, either with a probe or another sharp-pointed instrument, and then cleanse all the accumulated flesh within the cut as far as possible.
Then close the entire wound, including the cut and the upper opening, until it seals, and the corn remains open within the rectum, making it easier on the patient.  The corn may perforate in this manner.
If, when introducing the probe into the fissure, it is in a side of the rectum, near the surface of the body, along with the skin and the surrounding rectum, then take a probe with a pierced tip, like a shoemaker's awl, in this way:
Then insert a twisted thread, of five threads or so, into it; and introduce the probe with the thread into the fissure until you reach its bottom. If it is perforated along the edge of the rectum from the inside, close by.
Then remove the thread from that perforation by inserting your finger into the rectum and pulling out the end of the thread. Bring both ends together and tie them tightly. Leave it for a day or two. Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads breaks and falls off. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the fissure is not perforated, then perforate it as best as you can, unless it is very deep.  Do not do this to the muscle lest you sever it. Then proceed as we described until it heals.
The shape of the pointed probe used to divide the fissures should have a very sharp curve on one side and a blunt one on the other, so as not to cut what is unnecessary, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-one.
Concerning hemorrhoids that bleed, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids come in two types: either they are within the anus, resembling red swellings or like grapes, sometimes small, sometimes large, and blood constantly flows from them.
They may be single or multiple, and they may be outside the anus, on its edges.  However, those outside the anus are usually less moist; a yellowish liquid or a little blood flows from them constantly.  They are the same color as the skin.
The treatment for those inside the anus is to have the patient defecate and strain until the anus is stretched and the polyps are exposed. Then quickly grasp them with forceps or your fingernail and cut them at their base. If forceps do not hold them because of their moisture and relaxation,
Then, grip them with a rough cloth or a piece of sharpened wood or pull them out with your fingers and cut them.  Then, after cutting, sprinkle some sharp powders on them to act as cauterization, or cauterize them as described in the section on cauterization.
Then treat them with further remedies until healed. If the anus does not yield, give the patient an enema with a little bit of stinging to cleanse what is in the anus and to cause it to come out quickly when the patient strains.  As for polyps outside the anus, their treatment is easy and simple.
It is to grasp them with your fingernail or forceps, cut them, and then treat them with the methods mentioned until they heal.  If one is averse to cutting with iron, one should use a thread-like needle.
Then pull the wart upward and pierce it with the needle at its base from the other side. Tie the ends of the thread below the needle, which is positioned across it, and firmly pull the wart. Then tie the thread and remove the needle.  Do this with all the warts, leaving one unpierced.
So that some blood may flow from it.  Then, place a cloth soaked in rose or quince oil on the anus, and tell the patient to remain still.  Leave it until it falls off.  Once the warts fall off, treat them with ointments and other remedies until healed.
Concerning the treatment of fissures, they frequently arise from dryness of the stool and obstruction of the body. If prolonged and no treatment is effective, it is necessary to scrape them with a scalpel or your fingernail until they become moist and the upper crust that prevents healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more forcefully than before until it bleeds and peels. Then treat it; it will heal.
The Eighty-second Chapter.
On the treatment of ingrown nails, both ingrown and non-ingrown, dried warts, and the nits.
The ingrown nail is a round, body-colored swelling resembling a nail head, found throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and toes. Pain arises from it during walking.
One should slit the surrounding tissue of the nail, and remove it from its root using a lancet or forceps. Then treat it.  Alternatively, one can cauterize it as described in the relevant section. As for dried warts, each one is a small, rough, hardened, rounded protuberance on the body's surface.
They often appear on children's hands. Treatment involves stretching the wart, cutting or piercing it with silk thread or hair until it falls off.  Alternatively, it can be cauterized with fire or a potent medicine as previously mentioned.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts can be removed with the instrument I described in the treatment of nits.  Nits are also small, hardened, thick protuberances on the body's surface, penetrating deeply.  If they are exposed to cold, they cause a sensation similar to stinging from ants.
They occur throughout the body, most often on the hands.  Treatment involves taking a strong goose or eagle feather quill, forming a tube around the nit, then turning the tube with your hand until it splits the surrounding tissue.
And inserting it into the flesh, the nit is removed from its root. Alternatively, you can do this with a brass or iron tube in this manner:
The top of the tube should be solid, twisted, and easy for the fingers to grip and turn. Alternatively, cauterize the nit as previously described in the section on cauterizing warts.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
On the types of instruments used for injections in cases of rectal disorders, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, tin, or hollow or hammered copper.  Small and large versions of this instrument may be made, depending on the users' needs. So, those used for treating young children, or those with narrow or sore rectums, should have very thin syringes.  Image of a large syringe:.
Its upper funnel, where the bag is attached, should be wide, with a partition where the bag is tied as seen.  The lower tip, which enters the rectum, should be very smooth and seamless.  On one side, there are two small holes, and on the other side, a single hole.
The hole's width should be about the thickness of a reed or slightly thicker. The bag, in which the medicines are placed, is made from the bladder of an animal or the skin of a sheep, and shaped like a small tray, with a diameter of one span.
Many holes are pierced along its perimeter, with the holes being approximately a finger's width apart.  Then, strong thread made of doubled ten-thread yarn or similar is threaded through these holes, thereby gathering the bag like a small tray. When the medicine is placed inside, the syringe head should be firmly tightened between the stones.  Then, it is injected.  This is an image of the bag's circular shape and the holes.
How to inject with it: Fill the skin or bladder with the medicine, warmed to a temperature tolerable by the patient. Be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.  Then, the patient lies on their back with their legs raised.
A mat or blanket is placed underneath.  Then, the tip of the syringe is lubricated with ointment, egg white, or licorice saliva, or similar.  Gently insert it into the rectum.  The attendant holding the bag should squeeze it firmly with both hands until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the bowels.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient lowers their legs.  If the medicine is urging expulsion, let the patient retain it as much as possible.  If the patient sleeps with it all night, it will be more effective in treating the condition.  If injected for diarrhea and expulsion is desired quickly, repeat the enema until the patient recovers.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, the syringe should be very gentle and smooth, unlike the syringes used for children.  This is a picture of a gentle syringe, with its skin taut.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
On the treatment of wounds.
I have previously mentioned in the division of treatment similar to cauterizations, and here I am describing their treatment by hand and medicines completely.  I say that wounds differ according to the thing causing the wound and the location of the wound.
The things causing wounds are numerous, such as striking with a stone, cutting with a sword or knife, stabbing with a spear, stick, or arrow, and similar things.
As for wounds according to locations on the body, they are like wounds on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and other organs.
I will describe the treatment of some wounds to make them a model and rule for all wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds specifically, because complex wounds will be mentioned in the first chapter of the third book of this book.
I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head, and it is not a bone fracture, I examine it. If it is from a blow with a stone or similar, and only the skin has been bruised, and the wound is large, and I fear that the patient will develop a hot swelling, then quickly incise the scalp at the location. Do not delay this, and let blood out according to his strength, if there is no impediment to bloodletting, especially if the blood coming from the wound is slight.  Let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the injured area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drinks, and thick foods. If there is an impediment to bloodletting, then he should reduce his food intake, avoid meat and drinks, and if a hot swelling occurs, apply a cotton pad dipped in rose oil, alone or mixed with a drink that has a binding quality, to the wound.
If you fear a hot swelling, apply to the wound, if it is fresh and still has its blood and the air has not altered it (as I will describe to you shortly), and if the air has altered it, apply some ointments.
Until the pus comes out, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large, and caused by a sword cut or similar, and its edges have not joined, bring them together with sutures as described in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging, and its attachment is only in a slight band, cut it and then treat the wound with remedies that will create strong flesh in place of the skin.  Tell the patient to eat strengthening foods such as heads and the like.
If a foulness occurs in the skin, but it is not adhering to the bone, cut away all the foulness and throw it away, then treat it.  If in these wounds there is an artery or vein that bleeds and the bleeding is not stopped by remedies, look for the artery.
If you find it, and it does not stop bleeding, sever it with a scalpel and tie it off.  If the situation demands it, and what we have mentioned is not helpful, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and simple, their treatment is easy and straightforward; it is sufficient to sprinkle this powder over them while they are still bloody.
Before the air changes it, the prescription for the powder is: one part frankincense, two parts myrrh, and three parts slaked or unslaked lime. Grind all of them, sift them, and fill the wound with it.  Bind it firmly so it adheres well.
It will clot with blood, then bind it from above with bandages.  Leave it undisturbed as long as it does not swell, for the remedy will not come off until it heals.  Lime alone may accomplish this if frankincense and myrrh are unavailable.
This action can also be done with lime in many large wounds, if its application is skillful and firm, and the wounds are fresh and bloody, provided the air has not altered them. However, if the air has altered them somewhat, especially if it is summer.
Applying this powder is not the only treatment; you should treat it as described previously by applying some ripening ointments or a barley flour paste made with water and honey, until the pus comes out.  Then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
If a minor fracture of the bone occurs in the wound, extract it with a cloth.  The treatment for head fractures has been mentioned elsewhere; the treatment for neck wounds is no different from that of simple head wounds.
If a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, there is no remedy except to avoid treatment with strongly astringent substances like verdigris, alum, and the like, as these harm the nerve and cause spasms.
Nothing cold should be applied to the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  Use gentle remedies like moistened rose water or rose oil and ceruse, which are repeatedly washed with fresh water.
If also washed with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner, and with moist ointments, if the wound is large, use sutures or bring the edges together with bandages, then treat until healed.
If the wound has a recess and pus has collected in the bottom, drain it from the lowest point.  If an artery has been severed and blood is flowing from the wound, either ligate it, tie it off, or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx, but the vessels are intact, bring the skin edges together with sutures along the larynx's cartilage. Do not touch the larynx itself, but smooth it and restore it to its natural shape, then tie it tightly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have a tightening and drying effect until healed. If the wound has affected the bone, explore it. If there are bone fragments, remove them all or as many as possible. If not possible, leave it until the wound becomes necrotic and heals, making removal easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle it with the powder we described. If bone in the wound has become necrotic and pus-filled, treat it as described in the section on chest and shoulder surgery.
If the wound is from a spear or knife and you see a recess, observe if air emerges when the patient breathes. If so, know that it is a fatal wound.  If there is no recess and the wound is fresh and bloody, do not apply the powder initially nor tightly close it, lest blood becomes trapped in the recess.
This will cause it to return to the heart and kill the patient.  Instead, apply a drawing ointment twice daily. If ointment is unavailable, place a moist linen compress in the wound to absorb the moisture, and position the patient to sleep with the wound uppermost.
To drain any accumulated matter. If three days or more have passed and the patient shows no spasms, abnormal heartbeats, or shortness of breath, and their general condition is otherwise good, consider the wound healthy. Treat it with bandages and other healing measures until healed.
If healing and the flow of air are continually prevented, know that it has become pus-filled. Treat it according to that section.  The patient should lie on their wound to drain any collected matter.  If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it as previously described with sutures.
If large, use the powder; if small, use the powder. If the wound has affected the bone and detached fragments, investigate the wound and promptly remove any loose fragments. If they are not loose, leave them until later.
If the wound becomes foul, this will make the fragments easier to remove.  The treatment for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body is the same as what has been mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-Five.
On wounds of the abdomen, bowel protrusions, and their suture.
A wound in the abdomen may be large, small, or medium-sized.  A large wound may expose one or several intestines, making their replacement and suture more difficult and challenging.
Even a small wound may present difficulties in another way, making replacement even more challenging.  If the intestines are not promptly returned to their proper position, they will swell and thicken, making replacement difficult.  Therefore, the best type of wound is a medium-sized one, because it does not present the same difficulty in returning the intestines as do the other two types.
Know that there are four types of sutures for the abdomen. Two types are general-purpose, suitable for abdominal sutures and for suturing other bodily wounds. The other two are specialized, applicable to other wounds, but are particularly suited for abdominal sutures.
I will describe them to you one by one with explanation.  If the wound is small and something from the intestines has protruded, and its return is difficult, this is due to one of two reasons: either the smallness of the wound, as we mentioned, or because the intestines have been inflated by exposure to cold air.
If this is the case, it is necessary to warm them by dipping a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water, alone or with added boiled thyme, saffron, and anise, and applying it to the intestines until the swelling subsides.
A drink with astringent properties may also be used, and is better than water alone for dissolving the swelling. If you see the swelling has subsided, moisten the intestines with water that has been boiled with hyssop or cumin, as this will make their return easier.
If its return is still impossible after this treatment, make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used for lancing boils. The initial treatment, if successful, is preferable to incision, but incision is resorted to only as a last resort when all else fails.  This is a depiction of the instrument.
Its one curved side is limited, and the other is unlimited. The thin end is not as sharp as a scalpel, but slightly blunt.  It is a small, lance-like instrument, as you see.  If the wound is wide and the intestines have entered, it is necessary to return them to their natural shape.
The specific location of the treatment, if achievable, is best.  However, if the wound is wide and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs elevated higher than their head. If it is in the upper abdomen, the head and chest should be raised higher than the lower body.
Likewise, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always aim to keep the side with the injury elevated higher than the other side.  This should be used in major and medium-sized surgeries.
For minor surgeries, position it as best you can. Then, summon a helpful assistant who will hold the entire wound in their hands, bring the edges together, and then reveal it gradually to the surgeon who will stitch it.
This is the basic method of stitching: take a needle or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Leave a space the width of a little finger on the edges of the wound and pierce one needle through the skin edges without threading a suture. Piercing it through the lining of the skin (the peritoneum) from inside, so that you have grasped both edges of the skin and of the peritoneum - four layers.  Then, tighten a doubled thread around the needle repeatedly from both sides until the edges of the wound are firmly joined.
Then leave a space equal to the width of a finger and insert another needle, threading it with the suture as you did with the first. Continue this with the necessary needles until the whole wound is closed.  Use needles of medium thickness.
Because very thin needles quickly cut through the flesh, and very thick needles have difficulty penetrating the skin, the needles should be of medium thickness.  The needle should not be inserted too close to the edge of the skin.
So that the flesh does not tear quickly and the wound does not open before it closes.  Nor should the stitches be too far apart, so that the wound does not prevent healing. Then cut the ends of the needles so they will not injure the patient while he sleeps, and attach pieces of linen to each end of the needles.
Leave it until you know the wound has healed. This type of suturing with needles is best suited for small surgical procedures, because one or two needles, or so, may suffice for stitching.
As for the method of suturing for a general wound, gather the four edges—that is, the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum—at once with a needle carrying a moderately thin and thick suture thread.  Then, after the needle has passed through these four edges, return the needle from the side from which you began.
So that the thread will be interwoven from above the wound, resulting in stitching similar to the stitching used to secure sacks, and keep a distance between each stitch equal to the thickness of a little finger.  This type of stitching is known by everyone.
With this method of stitching, a surgeon treated a man who had a knife wound in his abdomen. The surgical opening was more than a span, and about two spans of the midgut had been exposed. The opening was in the middle of the abdomen.
He repositioned the intestines after they had protruded from the wound for twenty-four hours.  The wound healed in about fifteen days, and he was treated until he was completely recovered.  He lived many years afterward, functioning normally in all respects.  The physicians had previously judged that he would not recover at all.
Surprisingly, I did not treat it with any ointment, as I was in a location with no available medications. I would place used cotton on the wound twice a day, and ensure it was washed with honey water until it healed.
Concerning one of the specific types of stitching, I mention it based on Galen's text: Begin the stitching from the skin, inserting the needle from outside to inside.  Once the needle has penetrated the skin and the muscle extending in a straight line along the entire length of the abdomen...
I left the edge of the peritoneum on the side where I inserted the needle, and I then inserted the needle into its other edge from inside to outside at the other edge of the diaphragm.  If you have penetrated it, penetrate it again in this same edge of the diaphragm from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and insert the needle into its other edge from inside to outside.  And as you insert it into the peritoneum, insert it also into the edge of the diaphragm on its side, until you have penetrated them all.
Then, beginning from this same side, draw a line along the edge of the peritoneum on the other side, bringing the needle out from the skin near it, then returning it to that skin, and drawing a line along the edge of the peritoneum on the other side with this edge of the diaphragm.
Bring it out of the skin on its side, and do this again and again, until you stitch the entire wound in this manner.  The overall description of this stitching is that it is like the stitching of furriers for furs.
By stitching the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leaving it once from the other side until it is emptied; and as for the second type of special stitching that Galen also mentioned, this is his account verbatim.
It is to stitch it in the manner that some healers stitch, by joining each part to its corresponding part naturally, bringing the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the diaphragm to its other edge, which is as I describe to you.
The needle should be inserted into the edge of the diaphragm near you, from the outside, penetrating it to the inside, leaving the edges of the peritoneum, then return the needle and penetrate it from the outside to the inside of both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again.
And penetrate it from inside to outside into the other edge of the diaphragm on the opposite side.  This type of stitching is better than the common, easy stitching previously mentioned. This is Galen's account verbatim. Some have said that stitching the abdomen with two needles may be appropriate. That is, to insert a single thread into them, starting by inserting the needle from your side and penetrating it to the other side, and inserting the other needle from the opposite side, penetrating it from your side, according to the stitching of the leatherworkers, just the same.
Know that if the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, its stitching is more difficult than in other abdominal locations.  As for treating the wound, its treatment is like that of other wounds.  If you apprehend the wound fresh with its blood before the air alters it, replace the intestines, stitch and secure it, then apply the medicated dressings.
If the wound has been altered by the air, apply some of the ointments available to you until it suppurates, the sutures fall out, and the peritoneum and diaphragm adhere.  Then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals.
If you do not have medications, apply to it, from the beginning of suppuration, old cotton and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.  If the wound is uncomplicated, you do not need further treatment in most cases. However, if you fear that the wound may cause pain in the major organs.
Therefore, you should dip soft wool in lukewarm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpit.  If he feels pain or foul odor in his intestines, which often occurs, inject him with a lukewarm, astringent black drink.
Especially if the foul odor has reached the intestines and the wound has pierced into its cavity. Know that the thicker parts of the intestines heal more easily, and the thinner parts heal more difficultly.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not heal from any wound that occurs in it at all, due to the abundance of large vessels within it, the thinness of its substance, and its proximity to the nerves.  However, if what has protruded from the wound is the omentum and you encountered it promptly, return it according to how you would return the intestine itself.
If it has been some time and it has turned green or black, you should tie a thread above the blackened area to prevent bleeding, because there are veins and arteries in the omentum, and then cut what is below that ligament.
And you should leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, outside of it, so it is easy for you to pull it and remove it when the omentum falls away and the wound becomes suppurated.  This describes a wound that occurs in the intestines. Now, if a perforation occurs in the intestines and is small...
It may sometimes be possible to repair it in some people, as I have seen a person who had a spear wound in their abdomen, and the wound was to the right of the stomach.  The wound became chronic, and pus, stool, and air were coming from it. I treated it, though I did not expect it to heal. I continued to treat him until he healed and the area joined.  When I saw that the area had healed, I feared that the patient might suffer a bad event in his abdomen.  But no such bad event occurred, and he remained in the best possible condition. Indeed, he ate, drank, had intercourse, bathed, and exercised, assisted.  Some experienced individuals have said that if a wound occurs in the intestines and is small, it should be treated in this way.
This is done by taking large ants, then bringing the edges of the wound together.  One ant, its mouth open, is placed on the wound edges.  When it bites down and closes its mouth, the head is cut off; then it sticks and does not separate.  Then another ant is placed near the first.
Continue doing this with several ants, according to the size of the wound, then close and stitch the wound.  Those heads remain adhered to the intestines until the intestines heal and recover, and no ailment occurs to the patient.  The intestines can also be sutured with fine thread.
The method of extracting the animal adhesive from the Egyptian reed is to take the end of this thread from the reed and pull it out.  Then, a thin, twisted linen thread is tied to its end, and this thread is inserted into the needle. The Egyptian reed thread is used to suture the intestines, and then the intestines are returned to the cavity.  This method of suturing with ants and the Egyptian reed is based on hope and expectation.
However, if the tear is large and extensive, especially in one of the small intestines, there is no remedy, and no cure is possible.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On the treatment of the common cold and the nasal obstruction.
Know that any wound or swelling that becomes chronic, transforms into an ulcer, does not heal, and constantly discharges pus, is generally called a fistula (nasoor) in any part of the body; and we call it a cold (zukam) or fistula.
It is, in reality, a hard, compacted, white mass without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather.  Sometimes it is moist, constantly discharging pus, and the moisture may sometimes stop.  This moisture may be abundant, small in amount, thick, or thin.
I have previously stated in the classification of surgical conditions that any ulcer that does not heal, in which flesh does not grow, is due to one of nine causes. One of these is either a deficiency of blood in the body, or poor quality of the blood, or because of hard flesh inside and on the edges that prevents the growth of good flesh. Or because the ulcer is severely affected by dirt and impurities, or because the ulcer itself is foul and the material it discharges is of poor quality, or because the treatment is not appropriate, or because there is a general epidemic in the city or a specific condition affecting the city.
Or because the ulcer is severely affected by dirt and impurities, or because the ulcer itself is foul and the material it discharges is of poor quality, or because the treatment is not appropriate, or because there is a general epidemic in the city or a specific condition affecting the city. As has been shown in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is slow, naturally, or because it involves one or several bones.  All these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medications have been described in the classification.
Here, I must inform you about the treatment of polyps and colds that are treated manually. Know that polyps can occur in all parts of the body, some leading to large veins, arteries, or nerves.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of many components, such as the hand or foot, and some lead close to a major organ or similar.
Those polyps of this type are difficult to cure, do not respond to treatment, and are a source of effort and ignorance.  If some polyps do not reach these aforementioned locations, there is hope and expectation for their treatment.
If you wish to ascertain this, take a probe of copper or iron.  If the polyp is straight, probe it with this. If the polyp has a curve, probe it with a thin lead probe, for lead is pliable.
If it (the probe) slips when entering and curves towards the curve, and if the polyp has many openings which you cannot determine with a probe, inject one opening with liquid. The liquid will flow to the other openings.
Then, investigate in any way possible to determine if there is bone or nerve, whether the polyp's base is distant or close, or whether it is a single polyp with multiple openings.  Ascertain all of this to the best of your ability by investigating and noting the pain when touching the area.
And similar to these are the signs and causes of the tumor.  If you have ascertained all this accurately, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  If...
If the polyp is visible, close to the surface, or in a healthy area distant from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the locations I have described, then dissect the polyp as described above and remove any hardened, decayed, or excessive flesh within.
And treat any flesh or wart that grows in its mouth until it heals. If the polyp is deep-seated and in a straight line, you should dissect it deeply as possible and then cleanse it of all its decayed flesh.
Then, use tightly wound, sharp medicated dressings and insert them into the polyp's base, which you locate with an instrument. Repeat this several times, so that the sharp medication eats away any remaining corruption in the polyp's base.
Then treat it with ointments that promote healthy tissue growth until it heals.  If it doesn't heal that way, cauterize it as described before. If the cause of the polyp is bone, and you are certain of that, probe and dissect it as I have instructed, unless something prevents you from doing so.
If it is a vein, nerve, or a major organ, as we mentioned, and you expose the bone with some corruption and blackness, remove the corruption, then treat it with something that promotes healing until it heals.  If it doesn't heal and the pus continues, as it was doing before.
Know that you have not completely removed all the corruption.  Expose all of it again, thoroughly scrape it, and cleanse it to the best of your ability, then treat it with a healing agent.  If it heals, well and good.  Otherwise, know that the corruption is deeply hidden.  Expose all of it again.
Thoroughly scrape and cleanse it to the best of your ability.  If the corrupted bone is small and you can pull it out, remove it with delicate forceps suitable for the task.
If there are many bones, thoroughly remove them all.  Do not leave any behind.  If any ligaments obstruct their removal, and there is no danger in cutting them, cut those ligaments and the flesh, if present, and free the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones immediately, apply something to fester the wound and leave it for several days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones fester.  Protect the wound, so the opening you created during your procedure does not close.
If you fear that, apply a cotton swab soaked in crushed sulfur with oil, or a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment, or one of the green ointments.  If these ligaments fester and the bones become loose, they will be easily removed and pulled out.
If it is a single large bone, like the tibia or femur, and only its surface has become corrupted, thoroughly scrape it until the blackness and corruption disappear, then close the wound.  If a large portion has become corrupted and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, it must be opened.
Cut it all the way to where the corruption ends, then treat it until it heals.  I will tell you of a case that happened to a young man in his leg to make it an example and help you in your treatment. This man was young.
About thirty years old, he had pain in his leg, from a cause originating inside the body, until the materials reached the leg and a large swelling formed.  There was no external cause.  Then, time passed with the doctors' errors, until the swelling opened.
A great deal of material flowed from it, and he was poorly treated, until the leg became affected and had many openings, all emitting pus and bodily moisture. A group of doctors treated him for about two years, but none of them were skilled surgeons.
Until they came to me.  I saw his leg, and the materials flowed from those openings in a great stream. The man's body had wasted away, and his complexion had turned yellow. I inserted a probe into one of those openings, which led to the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
I found that some of them led to others from all sides of the leg.  I then opened one of those openings, exposing some of the bone.  I found it corrupted, decayed, blackened, putrid, and perforated, until the perforation reached the marrow. I reported what I discovered.
I removed the corrupted bone, and I believe that there was nothing but that corruption which I removed and reported. Then, I applied healing medicines to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.  I then exposed the bone again, beyond the first exposure.
I found the corruption connected to the bone.  I reported what I saw of that corruption as well.  Then I attempted to heal it, but it did not heal or join together.  I exposed it again, and I continued to cut the bone piece by piece, trying to heal it, but it would not heal, until I removed approximately a span of bone.
I removed it with its marrow, then healed it with medicines, and it healed quickly and recovered.  This repetition of work and incision was necessary due to the patient's weakness and low tolerance, and my fear for his death, because he was experiencing fainting spells frequently due to excessive vomiting.  He recovered completely.
Solid flesh grew in place of the bone, and his condition improved in his body. His strength returned and he managed his affairs. He experienced no impediment to his walking that harmed him at all.  If a bone in any part of the body has broken.
Therefore, it is necessary to expose it in this manner: take a bandage and tighten it at the end of the protruding bone, and instruct someone to stretch it upwards.  Then, make another bandage thicker than the first.
Then, tie it to the flesh under the bone and stretch its end so the flesh pulls downwards.  You should expose the flesh at the location you wish to expose so the saw does not injure the flesh. Place a plank or board under the bone from below, securely.
Because if you do this, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupted bone. The incision should be slightly above the affected area, so that there is no corruption within the bone cavity which will not appear on the surface, requiring a further incision.
If the bone is corrupted but not protruding, instead connected but with corruption in the middle or part of it, expose the flesh from all sides. Then place the board underneath, and then make the incision from the initial side where the corruption is.
Once you have finished the incision, make another incision on the opposite side.  Let the incision be a little distance from the corruption, as we stated. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and incise the bone where it joins on the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but excision. If the corruption is in the hand or foot, treatment is extremely difficult, but you should scrape away the corruption however it appears to you and remove and clean it however you can.
By whatever method you can manage, provided no vein or nerve is encountered.  Know that the saws and instruments for cutting these bones vary according to the position of the bones, their thickness, thinness, size, strength and fragility. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a tool suited to each type of work.
Know that the tasks themselves will indicate the type of tool needed if you have long experience and understanding of this craft, for the master craftsman, having witnessed many illnesses, knows this. He may devise tools for each illness that are similar to these, and I am illustrating for you a collection of tools at the end of this chapter.
Make them examples to follow and use them as a guide for others, God willing.  Image of a saw:

Chapter Eighty-seven.
In cutting off limbs and spreading bones.
The limbs may become putrid either from an external cause or from an internal cause.  If you treat this decay with medicinal remedies and the treatment proves ineffective, and you see the decay spreading in the limb and nothing can stop it,
Then you should cut off that limb where the decay has reached, so that the patient is saved from death or a great harm that is greater than losing the limb.  A sign that this has happened to a person is that the limb becomes dark, so much so that you think fire has burned it.
Or it will rot after darkening, so that the rot spreads to the limb's surrounding tissue and takes hold of the whole body.  So be quick to cut it off.  Likewise, if the cause of the decay is from a sting of certain venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, snake, or centipede, and similar creatures.
If the decay or the sting is in the tip of a finger, cut off the finger and do not delay the decay from spreading to the hand.  Likewise, if it has reached the hand, cut it off at the base of the forearm, and do not delay the decay from spreading until it reaches the forearm.
Likewise, if it has reached the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow joint.  If the decay progresses and you see it spreading towards the shoulder, do not cut off the shoulder at all, for that would mean the patient's death. Use other treatments to the extent of your ability.
Likewise, do the same with the leg. If decay reaches the toe, cut off the toe at one of the phalanges. If decay reaches the foot, cut off the entire foot. If it ascends to the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If the decay has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to leave it and let the patient submit to death.  The method for cutting or dissecting the limb is to tie a bandage at the bottom of the place you wish to cut and tie another bandage above the place.
The servant of one bandage pulls downwards, and the servant of the other bandage pulls upwards. You, yourself, separate the flesh between the bandages with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is exposed. Then it is cut or dissected.  You should place linen cloths on all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the correct place, causing the patient excessive pain and a hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the place quickly, or apply some blood-stopping astringents, then return to your treatment until it is finished.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I am telling you about an example of a case in a man's leg, with the same condition I am describing: a blackening with a burning sensation like fire occurred in his leg.
This decay first appeared in his finger, until the man's entire body was affected.  The man despaired when he saw the decay spreading through the limb, and because of the severe pain and burning, he had it amputated at the joint and recovered.
After a long time, the same decay appeared in his index finger.  He came to me, and I applied the remedies I had on hand to his hand after cleansing his body, but the decay did not cease and began to spread to the other finger.
Until the decay spread to his entire hand, and he asked me to amputate it. I refused, hoping to prevent the decay, and also fearing that amputation would cause his death, as his strength was failing.  When he lost hope in me, he returned to his home.
I heard later that he eventually severed his entire hand and recovered.  I have related this story to be of help in understanding this type of illness and as an example to be followed.
Eighty-eighth Chapter.
On the treatment of abscesses and how to inject medications into them.
If a fleshy tumor forms in any limb and persists for a considerable period, then bursts or gradually resolves, emptying all the matter within it, leaving the site empty, like a container.
The skin over it, like a rag, becomes thin, and the damage is not severe enough to affect bone, nerve, or ligament.  Therefore, it is called an abscess, and not a fistula, unless the duration is so prolonged that the damage affects one of these tissues.
Then it is called a fistula or ulcer, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin, especially if it has become thin and like a rag, and you are sure it does not adhere to the site due to its corruption.
If you suspect the skin might still adhere, and the corruption hasn't reached that level, and if there's thick flesh on the skin, treat it with injections.  Observe the abscess. If it is large, and the pus it produces has a foul odor, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and alum, in equal parts, mixed in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens and resembles the consistency of honey.  Then take what you need, and dilute it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess.  Close its opening and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then extract it by squeezing. Do this for several days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul odor is gone.  You may also inject it with ash water, if you do not have this medicine.  This is done by taking the ashes of olive wood or oak wood, and pouring water over it.
Then strain it and inject it until you are certain the abscess has been washed out. If the patient does not respond to the Egyptian medicine or ash water, inject it with water and honey mixed with some powdered alum.
Or inject it with honey and syrup mixed together, because honey cleanses and washes, while syrup adheres to the abscess, especially if the syrup is somewhat astringent and drying. If you do this repeatedly and are certain the abscess has been cleared of its corruption, then inject it with something that promotes flesh growth.
For example, take some palm ointment and dissolve it in rose oil and a binding syrup, or inject it with other medicines and ointments whose properties we have described in the chapter on ointments. If the opening of the abscess is narrow and does not accommodate the injecting tube.
If it is narrow, widen it slightly with a metal instrument, or place a soaked wick in Egyptian or Syrian ointment there until it widens. Similarly, if the opening is wide, bring the edges together by stitching, leaving enough room for the injecting tube without more.
Also, if the opening from which pus is draining is high up, cut it at the lowest point so that the pus drains downward, because if pus is accumulated in the depths of the abscess, it prevents the growth of flesh there.
If you cannot cut the abscess toward the bottom as desired, then apply pressure to the limb so that the pus drains easily as you find suitable, and ensure that no pus remains trapped within it at all.
As for the adhesive medications that are applied to the abscess from the outside and how to apply them, take one of the adhesive ointments that matches what you want and spread it on a linen cloth, ensuring the cloth covers the entire abscess. Then, using scissors, cut an opening slightly wider than the opening of the abscess.  Spread some soft ointment onto another piece of cloth, sized to fit the opening, and apply it, keeping it a distance from the abscess opening so the pus can easily drain.  Do not remove the larger cloth until later.
For several days, the one on the abscess opening should be removed at all times to allow the accumulated pus to drain, and to see if the discharged pus is copious or scant, or ripe or unripe.
Also, check the site of the abscess itself: does the patient feel pain, or not?  Is there swelling, or not?  If your treatment continues in this way, and you see the material that is discharged being meager at the abscess opening,
Know then that the abscess has adhered, or is close to adhering.  In that case, treat it again the next day or on the third day.  When you have treated the wound, change the cloths and renew the ointment. If after a long time, thin pus comes out of the abscess, do not despair of its adherence.
For healing is near, because some people have slow flesh growth in their wounds, while others have the opposite. If, after many days, unripe pus comes out of the abscess, know that it has not adhered.  If the abscess adheres slowly,
Increase the use of drying medications, and let them be moist in consistency and dry in strength, such as the pistachio ointment if more colocynth has been added.  The most effective treatment is using pistachio ointment.
It is treated with rose oil and sprinkled with moderate-strength old wine.  Then mix it and use it.  You can do the same thing if you do not have pistachio ointment.  Honey, if cooked until it becomes thick, can be used, or you can take myrrh, aloes, and kender, powder all of them and sprinkle them over the honey while it is on the fire. Then apply it to a cloth and bind it to the abscess, or apply the thickened cooked honey, sprinkle the medicines over it, place the cloth on it, and bind it.
Long-leaved zeraun, iris root,  chrysanthemum flour, and rue, either individually or mixed, can be used.  Grind and sift them, sprinkle them over the honey I described, and use it.  If the abscess persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption within it.
If it has affected the bones, or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it with the treatment of the fistula as described previously.
Chapter Eighty-nine.
Treating the hangnail, injured fingernail, removal of excess finger, and separation of fused fingers.
A hangnail is excess flesh that grows under the fingernail of the hand or foot, and sometimes other fingers. If it persists and is neglected, it swells into a hot tumor.
Or it may fester and rot, even eating away the base of the nail, and possibly corrupting it entirely, and the rot may reach the bone, so it has a foul odor, and the end of the finger becomes wide and dark in color. If you treat it by the methods we described in the section and it does not succeed,
then you should cut away with the iron all the excess that grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound after that.  Cauterization is very beneficial in this case.  If the bone is sound and the nail is also sound,
If the edge of the nail has pressed the flesh inward, causing pain and irritation, then a thin strip should be placed under the edge of the nail that is irritating the flesh, raising it up, and that flesh should be gently cut away.
and apply to the remaining flesh the burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is gone. Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the rot has affected the bone, then you must cut away and remove that bone, for it will never heal as long as there is rotten bone within.
If you see decay and rot spreading through the finger, amputate it at one of the phalanges, as previously described, then treat it until it heals. If the nail receives a blow or injury and severe pain occurs, you should first bleed the affected area.
Then, using a sharp scalpel, split the nail with a slanted cut from top to bottom. Be careful not to reach the flesh beneath the nail with the split, as this will cause intense pain in the affected area and lead to the growth of excess flesh in that spot.  Then treat the area with something to alleviate the pain.
As for the extra finger that sometimes grows on some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may contain bone in some parts, or it may contain a nail;  and some of it may grow from the base of the joint of some fingers.
Or it may grow on some of the finger's phalanges.  Those that grow on some of the finger's phalanges do not move, and those that grow near the finger's joint may move.  If it is purely fleshy, cutting it is easy; cut it at its base with a wide scalpel.
However, if it grows from the base of the joint, treatment is difficult, and you should avoid cutting it.  As for the one that grows on the finger at one of the phalanges, it should first be cut flesh-wise, roundly towards the bone, then the bone should be chipped away with one of those saws appropriate for that.
Then treat it until it heals.  As for the adhesion that sometimes occurs between fingers, this often happens and is sometimes present from birth, or arises from a healed wound or burn, or similar things. It is necessary to split this adhesion.
So that the fingers return to their natural position.  Then, place between them a thin piece of linen soaked in rose oil, so that they do not rapidly fuse; or separate them with, or place between them, a thin sheet of lead until the area heals properly.
Likewise, if adhesion occurs between some fingers and the palm, split that adhesion as is suitable and improves the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On the severing of sinews.
Sinews are twisted, thick veins filled with dark, black fluid, found in most parts of the body; however, they occur most often in the legs, especially in the legs of those who wear heavy packs, carriers, and porters.  First, one should use vigorous rubbing to remove the dark matter.
Then, lance the affected area with a lancet.  Treatment with iron can be of two types: one where the dark blood is incised and removed; the other where the vein is cut and the entire substance removed.  Incision should proceed, first, by soaking the leg in hot water.
Until the thick, murky blood is loosened.  Then, the leg of the afflicted person is bandaged from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage.  Then, the vein is incised in one, two, or three wide cuts.
Then, remove the dark blood with your hand, from the lower leg upward and from the upper leg downward, until you remove an amount of blood that you see as sufficient, or as much as the patient can tolerate. Then, bandage it and instruct the patient to avoid foods that produce dark matter, and repeat the emetic and bloodletting.
When the veins become filled again and harm the patient,  as for its incision, it should be done as follows: Shave the leg of the patient if there is a lot of hair. Then, the patient should enter a hot bath and soak the leg in hot water until the skin is red and sweats or endure strenuous exercise.
If a bath is not available, heat the affected area. Then, cut the skin lengthwise opposite the vein, either near the knee or near the heel, and use hooks to open the skin and strip the vein from every side until it is palpable.
When it appears, you will see it red and distinct.  Once it is released from the skin, it looks like a tendon.  Then, insert a blunt probe underneath it, until it rises and comes out of the skin, and suspend it with a smooth, blunt hook.  Then, make another incision near that incision, about the width of three fingers.
Then, strip the skin off the vein until it is exposed. Then, lift it with the probe as you did before and suspend it with another hook as you did initially, then make another incision, or several incisions, if necessary.
Then, cut and sever the vein at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull and cut it until it emerges from the second incision. Then pull it to the incision above, and do this until you pull it out of the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, until all of it is out and then cut it.
If pulling and cutting is not effective, insert a needle with strong doubled thread, tie it, and pull. Insert the probe underneath and twist your hand in every direction until it comes out, ensuring it doesn't break, because if it breaks, it will be very difficult to remove it completely.
Leaving it untreated will cause harm to the patient.  Once you have completely removed it, place wool soaked in a drink and rose oil or oil on the wound site and treat it until healed. If the vein is twisted, contorted, or has turns in various directions.
If it is not straight, as we have said, you should cut it at each bend and twist. Then, suspend it with hooks to remove it completely.  Be careful when cutting it not to sever or injure the vein, as this will make it more difficult to remove.  Use caution in your efforts.
Image of the incision for removing the vein.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not have a bend like other hooks, nor should its tip be sharp to avoid injuring the vein.  It should be thick and smooth in its bend, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein with its thinness. Rather, it should have the advantage of thickness, as we said.
Chapter Ninety-one.
On the civil vein.
This vein originates in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and the Arab lands, and in hot, sparsely fertile countries.  It may also originate in other parts of the body besides the legs, arising from a festering wound beneath the skin.
As it occurs within the bodies of snakes, worms, the pustule of a wound, and the worms that grow between skin and flesh.  A sign that this vein is beginning to form is a severe inflammation in the leg, then the affected area swells, and the vein begins to emerge from that swollen spot.
As if the root of a plant or animal.  When its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing one to two dirhams, tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
Whenever something emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in the lead and tie it.  If it grows too large, cut off a portion and wrap the remainder.  Do not cut it from its origin before it is all out, because if you cut it, it will shrink and enter the flesh, causing a tumor, festering, and a foul ulcer in the area.
Therefore, it must be treated and drawn out gradually until all of it emerges from the body, without leaving any part behind.  In some people, this vein may grow to five or ten cubits in length.
I have heard that it has been known to emerge from a man to the extent of twenty cubits. If it breaks off during your treatment, insert a reed into the hole and gently press it against the body for a long time until everything is emptied out of it and try to heal the area with remedies for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears on a joint or in the leg itself, producing many openings from which branches emerge. Treat it as described in the division, and as previously mentioned.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Concerning the ulceration on the worms that develop under the tendon, called the cow's disease.
This disease is called "cow's disease" in some of our countries because it often affects cattle. It is a small, single worm that develops between the skin and flesh and crawls throughout the body, moving up and down.
Its movement from one part of the body to another can be felt, until it pierces the skin at some point, exiting as a result of the putrefaction of some humors, as seen with worms, snakes, and the formation of squash-like lumps in the abdomen.
The danger from it is that if it crawls through the body and ascends to the head, reaching the eye, it might burst through it, causing its destruction. This is a frequent occurrence. If you wish to treat it and remove it, it must be done when it is crawling and noticeable by touch.
Therefore, one should tie tightly around the area above and below it with a strong bandage, then make an incision and remove it. If it has burrowed into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply cautery to the area with fire until it burns it out.  The greatest concern is its potential to damage the eye, as we have mentioned.
If you see it in the head near the eye, tie tightly beneath it on the forehead, then make an incision and remove it.  The patient should also be treated with laxatives to cleanse the body of bad, putrid humors and should avoid foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
On incision of the disease known as the "nafar".
This disease, called "nafar" in our country, is a pain that appears in some organs, then spreads from one organ to another.  I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a woman in a remote area who uncovered her arm, and I saw a slight swelling in the vein of the arm.  After an hour, I saw this swelling creeping up her forearm towards her shoulder as quickly as mercury.
If it moves from one place to another, the pain disappears from that spot and settles in the shoulder.  Then, after an hour, it spread throughout the rest of her body, eventually reaching the other arm.  She then recounted that, as far as I could see, the pain travelled around her entire body.
I was astonished by the speed of its transfer from one organ to another.  Before, I had only heard of this disease affecting different body parts, but I had not observed it firsthand like this in this woman.
I attributed this only to the fact that the woman was from the desert, with a lean body and exposed veins.  Therefore, this moving pain was apparent to the senses.  It should not manifest in this way in those who are well-off, with a supple and hidden venous system.
If you wish to treat it, and the patient feels the pain, if it appears visibly as we described, then quickly press upon it from above and below and cut into it so that the trapped wind comes out and the location is cleared.
If you do not see it, treat it by shaking the body and using remedies that disperse wind, such as rotten seeds and scab seeds, and similar medications.
Chapter Ninety-four.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows vary according to their types and the locations of their penetration in the body.  Their variations in types include large and small, hollow and solid glass, and those with three and four angles.
Some have tongues, others have splinters.  As for their location in the organs, they are of two types: either in major hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar organs. If an arrow strikes one of these organs and signs of death that I will describe to you later appear, you should avoid removing the arrow, as death will most often follow. If these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not lodged deep within the organ, remove it and treat the wound.  Signs of an arrow striking the brain, piercing the bone and wounding the meninges include severe headache, dizziness, and fainting.
If these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not lodged deep within the organ, remove it and treat the wound.  Signs of an arrow striking the brain, piercing the bone and wounding the meninges include severe headache, dizziness, and fainting. Redness in the eyes and tongue, spasms, confusion of mind, vomiting, and possibly bleeding from the nostrils or ears.  Speech may cease, the voice may be lost, and white, porridge-like moisture, resembling the watery consistency of meat, may emerge from the wound.
If these signs appear, do not treat the patient or remove the arrow if it has not yet been removed.  As for the signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is close to the left breast and feels as though it has lodged in something solid, not hollow...
The arrow might exhibit a pulsating motion, and black blood may flow from the wound, followed by cold extremities, cold sweat, and fainting.  Know that death is inevitable.  A sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the expulsion of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels next to the neck swell, the patient's complexion changes, breathing becomes labored, and he craves inhaled cold air.  If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it will be near the smaller ribs, and breathing will be labored with severe pain.
He sighs and all the muscles of the shoulders move.  If the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain follows, and blood resembling the liver in its redness emerges from the wound.  If the arrow strikes the stomach, undigested food may emerge from the wound.
The situation is obvious.  If the arrow strikes the abdomen and penetrates, and something from the bowels, or the intestines, or the bladder, emerges from the wound, there is no hope for treatment or arrow removal.  If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine emerges,
If something protrudes from the wound and the patient's pain intensifies, know that he is doomed.  As for the other organs, such as the face, eyes, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are more likely to remain unharmed.
Unless the arrow struck an artery or nerve, and unless the arrow was poisoned, I will tell you something I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may use it as a guide for treatment. An arrow struck a man in the bridge of his nose, at the base of his nose.
I removed it from the other side, under the earlobe, and he recovered without any harm to his eye. I also removed another arrow for a Jew, which had struck his earlobe under the lower eyelid.  The arrow was concealed, and I only retrieved the small tip that was attached to the shaft.
It was a large arrow, from a composite bow, with square, smooth iron, and no ears.  The Jew recovered without further injury to his eye. I also removed another arrow from a Christian's throat; the arrow was Arabic.
It had two ears, and I cut between the uvula, as it had penetrated his throat. I gently worked on it until I removed it. The Christian recovered and was healed.  I also removed another arrow from a man's abdomen; we estimated he would die from it.
After about thirty days, or thereabouts, and with no change in his condition, I cut open the arrow, maneuvered it, and removed it. He recovered and suffered no ill effects. I saw a man with an arrow in his back; the wound had closed around it.
Then, seven years later, the arrow emerged from the base of his thigh. I saw a woman with an arrow in her abdomen; the wound had closed over it.  The arrow remained, and there was no change in her condition or any impairment in her normal activities.
I saw another man with an arrow in his face; the wound had closed. He experienced little pain.  Many such cases exist. I removed an arrow from a Sultan's commander; it was lodged in the middle of his nose, slightly deviating to the right.
The arrowhead disappeared entirely. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow lodged. I found the arrow wound very narrow. I probed it with a fine probe, but felt nothing. He experienced a prickling sensation and pain under his ear, on the right side.
I hoped that the prickling was due to the arrowhead, so I applied a dressing with drawing and ripening properties, hoping the area would swell and reveal the arrowhead, so I could then cut it out. However, no indication emerged that the arrow had reached that spot.
I continued applying the dressing for many days, but nothing happened.  The wound eventually healed, and the patient despaired of removing the arrow.  One day, he felt the arrow inside his nose and told me.  I then applied the strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it.  I felt the thin arrowhead, which adhered to the wood.  Then, I increased the application of the strong medicine, until the arrowhead itself was visible.  It took about four months.
Then, when the wound widened and I could insert forceps, I pulled and moved it, but it wouldn't come out.  I continued to manipulate it and use various tools until I finally grasped it with strong forceps, as illustrated at the end of this chapter.
The physicians had determined that his nasal cartilage could not be repaired, but I repaired it, and the wound healed completely, leaving the patient free of any further pain.  I am telling you how I removed this arrow so that you may use this as a model and guide for cases I have not mentioned.
Because the parts and details of this craft cannot be grasped by description or encompassed by a book.  Instead, the skillful artisan gauges the many from the few, the present from the absent, and invents new methods and tools in response to unusual cases.
Concerning this craft, I say that arrows are removed from the affected limb in two ways: either by pulling them out from the point of entry, or from the opposite side, which is where they should exit.
If the arrow is protruding through soft tissue, it can be pulled out. If it does not come out immediately, you should leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh becomes infected and it is easier to remove.  The same applies if it's lodged in bone.
If it does not come out, leave it for a few days and try pulling and moving it each day. It will come out. If it still will not come out after a few days, you should carefully pierce around the arrow in the same bone from every side with a fine awl, widening the path for the arrow, and then pull it out.
If the arrow is lodged in the skull, deep within one of the brain ventricles, and some of the symptoms I described previously appear, refrain from pulling the arrow out. Leave it until the situation improves after a few days.
Then, proceed with pulling out the arrow.  If it is deeply embedded and will not come out, use the awls around the arrow as described previously. Then treat the wound until it heals.  And if the arrow has lodged in a hidden part of the body... If it is hidden from sight, probe for it with a probe. If you feel it, pull it out with suitable instruments. If you cannot reach it due to the narrow wound and the deep penetration of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way,
then widen the wound to gain access to the arrow and remove it. If it has two prongs, grasp them and detach the flesh around them from every side with all possible methods. If you cannot remove the flesh, then fracture and twist the prongs until you can free it.
When attempting to remove an arrow from any location, use the forceps to twist it in all directions until you extract it.  Be extremely gentle so that the arrow does not break, making its removal more difficult. If you are unable to remove it after some time,
leave it for a few days so that the surrounding flesh decays. Then try again; it will be easier then. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments described in the relevant section.  Exercise caution to avoid cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon. Employ any method that works.
In every way possible, remove the arrow gently, carefully, and firmly, as I have described.  When pulling the arrow, it is best to position the patient as he was when the arrow struck him.
If this is not possible, use whatever positions you can.  As for an arrow exiting from the opposite side, either something of the arrow will be visible externally, or you can feel the arrowhead close to the surface of the skin.
Cut along it, making the incision wide enough for the forceps. Then pull it out; it will be easier to remove. If it is lodged in bone, twist the forceps in a circular motion until the arrow loosens its grip on the bone and makes room for itself, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days and try again until it comes out. If the shaft of the arrow remains, push it out with it. If the shaft has fallen off and you want to push it out, insert a hollow instrument into the arrowhead and use it to push the arrow out.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that fits into the hollow. This will make removing the arrow easier.  If the arrow is poisoned, you should remove all the poison from the affected flesh if possible, and then treat the wound appropriately.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or flank, and is close enough to be felt with a probe, and you can make an incision, make an incision, being careful not to sever a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if necessary, and treat it until it heals.  Image of the forceps used to extract arrows:.
Its tips are like the beak of a bird, crafted so that, when it grips an arrow or something else, it will not let go.  Different sizes—large, small, and medium—are made, depending on the size of the arrow, the extent of the wound, and its width.

This is solid at the end, like a rod, to easily enter the hollowed-out arrow and push it out.
Chapter Ninety-Five.
On the opening of veins.
The veins commonly opened in the body are thirty in number.  Among them, sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the *hasisins*; the two arteries on the temples, visible; and the two veins at the corners of the eyes, known as the *naazirins*.
And the vein standing in the middle of the forehead, the vein at the tip of the nose, and the two veins in the neck, and the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins in the lower lip, and these veins known as the *jayharak*, and the two veins under the tongue.
And as for the veins opened in the arm and hand, they are five veins. One of them is the *qayfal*, which is from the outer side, and the common people call it the vein of the head. And the *akhal*, which is the middle vein, is composed of a branch of the *basliq* and a branch of the *qayfal*, and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the *basliq*, which is situated on the inner side, is also called the *abtar* and the common people call it the vein of the abdomen and the cord of the arm; it is situated on the elbow, and it is that which clings to it. And it is that which is clearly visible above the thumb, and the *asilim*.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, with two branches.  In the leg and foot, there are three veins: one beneath the knee bend on the outer side, the second is the *safin*, located at the heel on the inner side, and the vein of the women, located at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg, there are three veins like them.  As for the two veins behind the ears, their opening is beneficial for chronic colds, migraines, scabies, and chronic, bad head sores.  And the method of their opening, as I describe.
This is done by shaving the patient's head and rubbing its back at the location of the veins with a rough cloth, rubbing thoroughly. Then, the patient's neck is bound with a turban until the veins appear, their location being behind the ears, in the low parts of the head. Then, you feel for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark it with ink.
Then take a scalpel, known as a *nishal*, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone. Then, lift the vein and skin upward and cut the vein with the skin in a severed manner, the length of the cut being about two clenched fingers.
Or similar, and drain the amount of blood desired. Then tie them with ligatures and leave them until healed.  Their cutting and cauterization were previously mentioned at the beginning of the book.  As for the two arteries in the temples, their opening is beneficial for chronic migraines, severe headaches, chronic eye inflammation, and sharp discharge of humor into the eyes.
Their opening, as I describe to you, involves binding the patient's neck with a turban until the veins appear clearly to the touch, and their pulsation becomes apparent under your finger.  At that point, mark it with ink.  Then, lift the skin from above the vein with your index finger.
Insert the *nishal* scalpel from below, lift the vein upward, and sever it as you did with the other veins. Drain the blood as needed. Then, loosen the patient's neckband and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Then apply a piece of cloth and a ligature, and tie tightly from above. Leave it until healed.  Their mention, cutting, and draining were previously discussed in the beginning of the book.  As for opening the forehead vein, its benefit, following the opening of the temporal veins, is for chronic facial conditions such as sores, ulcers, and persistent redness.
Its opening, as I describe to you, involves the patient binding their neck with a turban until the vein appears.  Then, take the instrument called the *fas* (axe).  Here is its image:
Place the pointed end of the axe on the vein, strike from above with a mallet or similar object, and allow the blood to flow as desired.  Then, loosen the patient's neckband and secure it tightly until healed.
One may also open it with a broad scalpel, but it should not be a sharp-edged scalpel like other scalpels, rather slightly broad-edged.  Open it along the groove, because the bone is close by.  A thin scalpel might break there.
As for the veins in the eye sockets, their benefit is for eye ailments like scabies, redness, and sores, and facial diseases.  The method of opening them is for the patient to bind their neck with a turban, then to open them while standing over their head.  Open them along a slight longitudinal groove with a small, slightly broad scalpel.
If the area has little flesh, a thin-edged scalpel might break.  Take as much blood as you need, and place a bandage over them.  Secure them for one night, then release them.  As for opening the nasal vein, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
Severe headaches and facial diseases such as the red rash that appears on the nose, especially if chronic, are treated by this method.  The procedure involves binding the patient's neck, holding their nose with your left hand, and taking a long, thin scalpel.
Insert it into the center of the nostril itself between the nasal partitions in a straight line, because the vein is not apparent to the touch there.  Blood will flow immediately.  You should push the scalpel slightly and take the desired amount of blood, then bandage it for a night.  It will clot quickly.
As for the jugular veins, their opening is beneficial for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and melancholic diseases that appear on the skin's surface, such as black vitiligo, scabies, foul ulcers, and cankers.  The procedure for opening them is to bind the patient's neck beneath them with a bandage, and the surgeon should stand over the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair, then the vein is opened lengthwise, with a somewhat wide incision.  Then, the moderate amount of blood, or as much as needed, is drawn.  The same procedure is performed on the other vein.  Finally, the bandage is released.
The veins are bound with a moderate pressure to prevent suffocation, and the patient is left for the next day.  The wound will heal.  As for the veins in the neck, opening them after opening the jugular veins is useful for sores in the mouth, gum disease, foul ulcers, cracked lips, and foul sores.
Those that are in the nose and around it.  The procedure for opening them is to have the patient sit facing you, and tie their neck with a turban.  Then, turn their lips and look for the veins; one will be seen to the right of the lip, the other to the left.  Identify them by their blackness.
Around them are also thin black veins, so cut them off completely.  If it is unclear and you do not know what they are, then aim for the largest and clearest ones.  Do the same with the veins in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, opening them after opening the jugular veins is useful for the constrictions that occur in the throat due to the disease of the larynx and diseases of the mouth.  The procedure for opening them is to have the patient sit before you facing the sun, raise their tongue, and look under the tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for a vein. Their color is towards black.
Open them, and be cautious. Do not cut them deeply, as there are arteries beneath them. Excessive bleeding from those arteries might occur.  The three veins opened at the elbow are those customarily opened in all people. Opening them can be done in two ways.
Either by piercing with a wide, aromatic lancet or olive-shaped lancet, towards the soft tissue, or by cutting with a scalpel, which is the scraping [and this is its image].  Image of the wide, aromatic lancet:
It should be wide, as you see, to be suitable for opening the hollow, full, prominent, visible, thick veins that contain thick, dark blood. And this is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:
This lancet is narrower and has a thinner tip, suitable for opening thin veins that contain thin, yellowish blood.  And this is the image of the scraping lancet.
This scraping lancet, which is suitable for cutting, comes in various widths and thicknesses, according to the width or narrowness of the veins.  One may infer other things from this as well, and it is well-known among craftsmen.
And concerning the jugular vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from the ailments that are beneath the throat and neck, extending to the chest and abdomen. The phlebotomist should be cautious when opening it, and should be aware that there is an artery underneath.  If he makes a mistake and inserts the lancet too deeply, he will sever that artery.
This will cause bleeding, therefore, it should not be opened with a pointed lancet, but rather opened with a scraping lancet.  If the jugular vein is not clearly visible, it should be avoided, and one should turn to another vein or try to find a branch of it.
Or open the arm's vein instead, for it is clear and can be opened with the scraping lancet, as we said.  If you wish to open it specifically, then before tightening the arm, you must feel the area until you locate the pulse point and mark it with ink.
Then the arm is tied and the vein is opened with a slanted cut using the scraping lancet, as we said.  Carefully ensure that the incision is made away from the artery's location.  Whenever you see inflation at the marked spot after tightening the bandage, that inflation is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood during the phlebotomy surging like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is arterial blood.  Immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger; if the bleeding stops, it often stops, and tighten the arm.
Leave it be, and warn the patient about neglecting it.  Let it be on a pillow, and do not move it for days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop and overwhelms you and you do not have a remedy at hand, cut the artery if it appears to you, for its extremities contract and the blood stops.
Or take a pistachio shell, split it, and take one half, and tightly bind it over the vein with a bandage and a splint until the next day. If the bleeding stops, then do so; otherwise, treat it with the previously mentioned methods of applying cauterizing instruments to stop the bleeding. Stopping the bleeding is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the small size of the wound and the tightness of the bandage on the arm, be aware of it.  As for the black vein, the benefit of its opening is to draw blood from the top of the head and the lower part of the body, since it is composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we said.
The phlebotomist should be careful when performing the procedure.  Underneath, there are nerves.  If the lancet is driven too deep and strikes a nerve, numbness will result, making it difficult to treat, and possibly will not heal at all.  This nerve is often perceptible to the touch.
If in some people it is hidden and thin, not discernible, then you should make your incision a shallow one with the lancet, and avoid the nerve to the best of your ability. If the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its opening is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases, and in this vein especially, if you wish to open it, make the incision with the olive-shaped lancet or the wide, rue-shaped lancet, because it is the safest of all veins, as there is neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it.
However, when performing the phlebotomy, you should avoid striking the head of the muscle with the lancet and seek the soft spot.  If it is not struck in the first attempt, it is not harmful to repeat the phlebotomy multiple times, although it may swell in some people if not opened in the initial attempt.
But that swelling will not harm him.  As for the method of phlebotomy, its symptoms, and what should be done to treat them, first you must know that phlebotomy is used either to preserve health only.
Or it may be used in diseases.  The one used to preserve health and maintain it and to guard against diseases should be done on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the cephalic, the basilic, and the median cubital vein.  Phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring, if signs of fullness appear.
Phlebotomy should be performed on Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of daylight have passed.  As for phlebotomy used in diseases, it does not have a fixed time, but whenever necessity and urgency require it, whether night or day.
At all hours and at all times.  Boys should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should elderly men who have passed sixty.  If anyone intends to perform phlebotomy for any reason...
He should cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a gentle enema if there is much retained phlegm, lest foul matter from the bowels be drawn into the veins during phlebotomy and harm the major organs.  A feverish person, a drunkard, or an inebriated person should not be bled until these conditions subside.
One should also beware of phlebotomy after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, exertion, exercise, late nights, fasting, and all that weakens the body, physically or mentally.  Then, if the blood is thick, one should look into thinning the humors beforehand.
With foods, drinks, and medications if possible.  Then he should enter a bath if nothing prevents it, or do some light exercise, so that the blood is thinned, and he should perform the phlebotomy in the middle of the day as we have said.  He should also try to clear his mind of all bad thoughts that day.
He should avoid worries, anger, and fear, and all physical ailments such as extreme fatigue, exhaustion, and sexual activity, and similar things.  He should prepare a pleasant environment, including perfumes, herbs, and amusements, in keeping with the customs and abilities of each person.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion higher than the one the patient sits on, and the phlebotomist should rub the patient's arm with his hand two or three times, then tighten the bandage with a ligature and twist it two or three times, keeping the tightening moderate.
Because if the tightening is excessive, it will prevent the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it will also prevent the flow of blood.  Then, after tightening, the patient should rub his hands together.
Until the veins swell and become noticeable.  Then the phlebotomist should lightly oil the lancet, especially with old oil.  Then he should place his left index finger on the same vein, slightly below the spot where he intends to make the incision, so that the vein is not displaced during the puncture. Because some veins are like tendons, pulling away during the incision, and others are full of air, and when the lancet is placed on them, they recede under the lancet, deceiving the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein. If it does open it, it only does so to a small degree.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be cautious and careful in all these matters. Then he lowers the lancet; if it opens the vein on that first attempt, well and good; otherwise, he tries again slightly below or above that spot, quickly if the area has not swollen.
If the patient swells or feels pain, leave it for a day or two without tightening the bandage, as it might cause a hot swelling. He should not enter a bath. Then he may repeat the incision if he wishes, if the lancet wound was small, and the blood flow was thin.
Fearing that not enough blood will be drawn, the phlebotomist should reinsert the lancet into the same puncture, gently and straight, and slightly enlarge the opening.  Do this quickly before the area swells, as a small opening can cause swelling in many people.
If you see it has swollen, do not return to that spot; it will not help. Apply some clarified oil; it facilitates blood flow, and is superior to plain oil and other ointments in this case.
Use clarified oil in all your vein-opening procedures when blood flow is difficult.  This remedy, and also shukhznaya, can achieve the same result if applied to the affected area. The blood will thin and dissolve if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the incision site, which often happens especially for those who have never been bled before, or if the vein opening was small, immediately apply a sponge dipped in slightly warmed salt water to the swelling and bandage it for an hour. It will dissolve.
This should be done after the blood from the vein itself has completely drained or from another vein. If a dark or greenish residue remains at the site after a few days, it is not harmful. If you wish, apply a poultice of powdered myrrh and gum.
Or something from the juice of fudhanj, and similar things.  A swelling or lump often occurs when bleeding basilisk veins. If, upon pressing on it, you find it pulses, that is a bad lump. Beware of applying anything to it that we have mentioned.
For it may bleed arterial blood. However, bandage it with something that constricts to solidify the area, and then treat it with other remedies until it heals.  One should draw from each person according to their strength and the predominant color of their blood.
If the blood is dark, let it flow until it turns red.  Likewise, if you see it thick, let it flow until it becomes thin.  And if it is sharp, let it flow until its sharpness is gone.  A strong, full individual needing a single, large bloodletting should...
...widen the vein opening and use a wide lancet.  A weak individual, however, should do the opposite.  And it is necessary to remove the blood in stages.  The opening should be narrow.  The best tool for opening a vein is a curved, slanted incision, not a pointed one.
This type of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and nerve damage. It is better and safer than bloodletting across or lengthwise.  If fainting often occurs during bloodletting, it is necessary to give the patient something to eat before the procedure, such as bread soaked in pomegranate juice or sweetened water.
If he is feverish and has his blood drawn three or four times, if his constitution is cold, let him eat bread soaked in myrrh liquid, or honey-based drink scented with perfumes, or a pleasant herbal drink before the bloodletting.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting due to excessive blood loss, he should be given meat broth and a light herbal drink.  Perfume the patient with musk and wash the patient's chest with it.  Use all the treatments mentioned in the section on fainting.
For those who have had extensive vomiting, and whose strength is weak, if they wish to release their arm's blood again, the blood should be released slowly, little by little, according to their strength over several consecutive days.
For those who want to release their arm's blood again and whose body is strong, let them do so after seven or nine hours from the first bloodletting.  If one wishes to draw blood from their body to the opposite side where it has accumulated, then blood release should occur on the second or third day.
If the patient has excessive, heated, and inflamed blood in their body causing fever, blood should be released in one session, removing a large quantity, widening the opening until fainting occurs, after careful consideration of all bloodletting requirements. Place your hand on the patient's pulse while the blood flows to prevent death instead of fainting, as this often occurs if the bloodletter is unaware and careless.  This should not be done if you intend to release the arm's blood again.
If the vein opening has closed and blood flow is difficult, do not forcefully poke or twist it, as this is very harmful. Instead, either leave it until a subsequent bloodletting, or remove the clotted blood from the vein opening with a lancet.
Or apply something dissolved in water, like salt, or a healing remedy like Faruq or Shakhzanaia, and gently poke it until blood flows. If the vein is swollen, leave it.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides.  If further bloodletting is absolutely necessary, either perform it above the affected area or in the other arm or a different vein.
Bloodletting from the arm's artery is a substitute for bloodletting from the eyesocket or the temples if those sites are not available or are difficult to access, as it contains elements from both.  To do this, the patient should put their hand in warm water until the vein in their forearm becomes red and clearly visible.  Then, apply a moderate bandage pressure just above the area.
Then, cut the vein slightly off-center, neither horizontally nor vertically, and make the incision wide.  Do the lancing just above the wrist joint. If blood flow is difficult, re-immerse the arm in the warm water container and allow the blood to flow into the water.
Until you have taken the amount you need. If it is summer, you may omit the step of returning the arm to warm water. The practice of letting the blood flow into the warm water is most often used in winter.  Bloodletting from this vein is the safest of all the veins. Because there is no vital vein or nerve underneath.  Bloodletting from the ulnar vein of the right arm is beneficial for liver ailments.  To do this, tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand, after first immersing the arm in warm water until the vein swells.
Because there is no vital vein or nerve underneath.  Bloodletting from the ulnar vein of the right arm is beneficial for liver ailments.  To do this, tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand, after first immersing the arm in warm water until the vein swells. The vein will be clearly visible.  Cut it slightly off-center.  If you sever it completely, it will do him no harm.  Be careful; do not press too hard with the lancet, as there is a nerve supplying the fingers beneath, and the area is devoid of muscle. Then, return the arm to the warm water.
Leave it to continue flowing. If you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein and cease to flow. Once you have removed the required amount of blood, apply ointment and salt to the vein to prevent rapid clotting.
You should also do this with every constricted branch.  As for the benefit of bloodletting from the left arm, it is beneficial for spleen ailments.  Do the same as you did with the second vein.  As for bloodletting from the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower body, such as uterine ailments.
And for menstrual retention, kidney ailments, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.  The method of bloodletting is to immerse the leg in warm water and apply massage until the veins dilate.  Then, tie above the joint of the leg with a bandage. The vein is located near the heel, visible near the big toe.
From it, many branches extend along the leg.  Therefore, cut into the widest branch, or near the heel where it joins, as this is the best and safest option.  If you cut into the side of the leg, be careful of the nerves beneath it.
Make your incision with a twisting motion, as if you were intending to sever it, and the lancet should be sharp.  If the blood is slow to flow, return the leg to warm water and let the blood flow until it is emptied. If the practitioner misses the vein on the first attempt.
If the practitioner misses the vein on the first attempt, return to a point slightly higher on the leg.  The location is safe; there is no danger if you avoid the nerve, as we said before. The same procedure applies to the saphenous vein on the other leg.  As for the femoral vein, it is located, as we stated, at the heel on the outer side.
The benefit of bloodletting is for hip pain if caused by hot blood.  The procedure for bloodletting is to have the patient enter a warm bath, then quickly and tightly bandage the leg from the hip to above the heel with a thin, long bandage. Only then will it be apparent.
If it appears, then lance it in any manner, either twisting (which is better), or severing, or slitting.  The location is safe; and in most people it is quite hidden, if not found.
If it does not appear at all, then lance some of its branches, which appear on the back of the foot near the pinky and ring fingers.  Be mindful of the nerves, and release the desired amount of blood.
Then loosen the bandage, place a bandage on the site of the bloodletting, and bandage the area.  It will quickly heal.
Chapter Ninety-Six.
On Cupping and its Use.
Cupping vessels may be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass.  Cupping can be of two types: one with a specific purpose, involving the application of a cup and the removal of blood; the other without a specific purpose.
And this cupping without a specific purpose is of two types.
And the cups of the "deceivers," which are the sides of the neck on both sides, and the cups of the chin, which are below the lower jaw of the mouth, and the cups of the shoulders, and the cups of the coccyx on the rump, and the cups of the forearms, which are the middle of the arms, and the cups of the legs, and the cups of the ankles.
Cupping draws blood from the fine veins spread throughout the flesh.  For this reason, it does not weaken the strength like bloodletting, and cupping, whether with or without fire, should not be used for any disease arising from fullness until the whole body is emptied.
If cupping is needed, whether due to illness or custom, we use it at all times, at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any time.
For some people, when there is an excess of blood requiring removal by cupping, they experience heaviness and headaches in their heads. Some experience fullness, redness in their face, head, and neck. Some experience itching in their face, cheeks, and darkness and heaviness in their eyes. Some scratch the area where they were cupped.
Some laugh excessively, some taste blood in their mouths, their gums throb, and they spit blood. Some sleep excessively, and some see blood, redness, killings, and wounds, and the like, in their dreams. Whenever we see any of these things...
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours have passed during the day.  The benefit of cupping the neck is that it is helpful for heaviness in the head and water running down into the eyes.
However, it is necessary that this be done after the entire body has been emptied. This cupping may be a substitute for venesection of the temples. One should beware that those with a cold head or a cold, should not use it, as it will greatly harm them.
Therefore, it is not appropriate for the elderly or those with cold diseases of the head to use it.  And those who use it habitually may become forgetful.
Therefore, the cupper should lower the cupping vessel slightly, for fear of forgetfulness.  Cupping the shoulder is a substitute for venesection of the temples and the veins at the base of the skull.
Therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, disruption of the respiratory apparatus, coughing, and fullness.  The cupping of the shoulder should be raised slightly, because if it is lowered, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
Cupping the temples is beneficial for headaches, ophthalmia, migraine, suffocation, and toothache.  It is a substitute for venesection at the base of the skull.  The cupper should be instructed not to insert the instrument deeply lest a vein be severed and bleeding result.
Cupping under the chin is beneficial for sores in the mouth, gum disease, and similar mouth ailments.  It can replace venesection of the veins on the lips.  Cupping the shoulders is beneficial for palpitations due to fullness and heat.
Cupping the forearm pit is beneficial for what the venesection of the three veins—the veins at the base of the skull, the temples, and the neck—is beneficial for, because it draws blood from all those thin veins in the flesh and draws those thin veins from other, thicker veins until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
The cupper should be instructed not to push the instrument too far, as the area is lacking flesh and has nerves and arteries underneath.  A single cupping on the coccyx is beneficial for hemorrhoids and sores of the lower part of the body.
The cupper should be instructed to use a large, brass cupping vessel, as the area requires strong suction; a glass cupping vessel may break.  A considerable amount of pressure should be applied.  Cupping the legs clearly reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the entire body and is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, and promotes menstruation.  It is also beneficial for boils and abscesses and acts as a substitute for venesection of the veins in the inner thigh and the ankles.  However, it greatly weakens the body, and fainting occurs in most people.  Cupping the ankles is similar in benefit to cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping is to first place the empty cupping vessel and apply moderate suction.  Do not prolong the application, but place and remove the cupping quickly so that the humors flow evenly to the area.  Repeat this until the area reddens and opens.
When the redness of blood appears, then apply pressure and resume the suction gradually.  Then observe the condition of the body.  For those with delicate, porous flesh, a single pressure is sufficient, to avoid causing an ulceration.
The cupper should widen the pressure, deepening it slightly, and regulate the suction with gentle movement. If the blood is thick, then the pressure should be applied twice.  The first time to open a path for the thin and watery blood, and the second to remove the thick blood.
If the blood is very thick, the pressure should be applied a third time to achieve the desired result.  In general, if we want to remove a small amount of blood, a single pressure is sufficient. If we want to remove a large amount of blood, we apply more pressure. If the blood is thick, we apply more pressure.
The pressure should be deep.  The moderate limit of the pressure is just the depth of the skin.  What ointments should be used when applying cupping?  And what water? What should the cupper beware of?  For those with thick, hard, dry skin, and narrow pores...
The cupping sites should be anointed with opening, softening, and dissolving ointments.  In the summer, examples include the ointment of Khwari, or the ointment of violet, or the ointment of sweet almond, or the ointment of pumpkin seed.
In winter, examples include the ointment of narcissus, or the ointment of lily, or the ointment of chamomile, or the ointment of hyacinth, and the like.  If the excess is thick and cold, use the ointment of marjoram, or the ointment of cumin, or the ointment of frankincense, or the ointment of dill, and similar ones.
If the cupper has wide pores and soft flesh, then the use of ointment should be avoided.  These should wash their cupping vessels after the procedure with rose water, or cold water, or elderberry water, or pumpkin water, or water from the *rajla* plant, or similar.  As for those with excessively moist blood...
They should wash their cupping vessels with vinegar, or with rue and sumac water, and the like.  As for those with thick excess, they should wash their cupping vessels with old wine, or marjoram water, or dill or chamomile broth, and similar things.  Cupping should be avoided in the bath and immediately after the bath.
Rather, it should be used one or two hours after leaving the bath.  One should not sleep after cupping.  This is what the cupper and the leeches should manage before and after cupping.
One should first observe if the cupper or leech is bilious, and if their blood is predominantly characterized by sharpness and inflammation.  Then, they should take cooling things like pomegranate, dandelion, vinegar, lettuce, sicken, and the like.  Their food should consist of poultry, lamb, and other similarly lean meats.
And for those whose temperament is cold, they should be given honeyed drinks, drinks made from *mi'ba* or *sakanjbin* (a specific type of syrup), and moderate aromatic wine, which is between old and new.  A reduced diet is prescribed, with food consisting of poultry, partridges, sparrows, and doves.  Food should be less than the drinks on the day of cupping and leeches.
In some cases, and for certain individuals, a potion of antidotal remedy or musk medicine or *shiltha* may be administered before cupping or bloodletting, or afterwards, to strengthen the major organs and thin the blood.  However, it should not be given to those who are feverish.
As for cupping without a specific condition, these are the cuppings placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney area, and groin.  These organs do not tolerate the condition, but they are used to draw blood from one organ to another.
For example, placing a cupping on the breasts in cases of blood-letting; or we use it to remove cold air that has collected in an organ, such as placing a cupping on the abdomen and navel.  This loosens the organ, warms it, and alleviates the pain by dissolving that air.
It may be placed on the kidneys if blockages or stones are present, as its strong drawing action may open the blockage or dislodge the stones.  Similarly, it is done on the liver and spleen when wind troubles them. These cuppings can also be used empty, by suction only.
It may be used with fire, or filled with lukewarm water in cases of paralysis.  This involves filling a large cupping with hot water alone, or water in which certain suitable herbs have been boiled.
Then, filled, it is placed on the affected area, held, and removed, repeated as needed.  This is the form of cupping that is used with fire.
Its opening is two open fingers wide, as illustrated, and its depth is half a span.  A small hole, big enough for a needle to enter, is made on one side, about halfway down. It is made of thick-edged Chinese or brass.
It is smooth, flat, and polished so as not to harm the organ when placed upon it. A crosspiece of brass or iron is in the middle to hold the lit candle.  This cupping can be made larger or smaller, according to the illnesses.
The user must be skilled, for cupping for children and thin people is different from that for men and those with large bodies.  As for how to place this cupping with fire on the organ, one should light a wick made of strong linen or a small candle made of pitch, and place it on the center of the fixed rod in the center of the cupping.
So that the fire ascends towards the bottom of the cupping, so that the patient's body is not burned.  Then, it is placed on the organ, and the finger is placed on the hole we mentioned so that when we hold the cupping, we don't need to remove the finger.
Steam will emerge from that hole, and the cupping will be applied to the site.  Then the wick is relit, and repeated if necessary.  As for the cupping used for dropsy, it does not have a fixed rod or a hole.
Instead, it is used by filling it with water and placing it on the organ only.  This is its image.
The larger this cupping is, to hold much water, the better.
Chapter Ninety-seven.
On the application of leeches.
Leeches are used most often on parts of the body where cupping cannot be applied, either because they are small, like the lips and gums, or because the part is bare of flesh, such as the finger and nose.
To use them, select leeches from clean fresh water free of impurities, then leave them in fresh water for a day and a night to starve and clear their stomachs. Then, the body is first bled by venesection or cupping, and then the affected part is cleansed.
Until it turns red, then the leech is placed on it.  If it fills up, it will fall off.  If the affected area can be suctioned by cupping, that is more beneficial. Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and it is a trickle, then soak a linen cloth in cold water.
Place it over the area until the bleeding stops. If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered alum or oak galls or similar astringents over it until the bleeding stops, or place peeled halves of chick peas on the area.
Leave it until the chick peas adhere to the area; the bleeding will stop. If the leech needs to be replaced, if possible, do not use the same leech. If the leech refuses to attach, wipe the area with fresh blood.
Or, insert a needle into the area to draw out some blood; then place the leech there.  If it senses any blood, it will attach to the spot. If you want to remove it, sprinkle some dates, salt, or ashes on it and it will detach from the spot.
Chapter Three.
On fractures.
This chapter also deals with the necessary skills in the medical art, namely the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in the bones.
Know, my children, that many ignorant physicians and common people, those who have never examined the writings of the ancients, nor read a single letter from them, may claim mastery of this chapter.
For this reason, this science has become extinct in our land, and I have never encountered a skilled practitioner in it. I have only gained what I have gained through extensive study of the works of the ancients and my diligence in understanding them, extracting knowledge from them, then through dedicated practice and experience throughout my life.
I have presented to you in this chapter everything that my knowledge encompasses. And after presenting it to you, having refined it from lengthy digressions, and condensed it to the utmost brevity, and elucidated it thoroughly, I have illustrated for you in it numerous depictions of the instruments used therein.
This is an added explanation, as I have done in the preceding two chapters.  There is no strength except from God, the Most High, the Great.
The First Chapter.
It contains a summary of the matter of fractured bones, and it is necessary to present them before we begin to describe the fractured and dislocated members one by one.  Before starting this chapter, it is necessary to provide a summary of the subject and its divisions. This will first compel you, and whoever else is eager to learn this noble craft, to understand and grasp its true meaning.
So I say, if a person suffers a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall, one should first promptly reduce the injury, or apply laxatives, or both. Unless prevented by factors such as weakness, or the individual who suffered the injury is a child or an old man, or the weather is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then, his diet should be limited to cold legumes, poultry, and venison.  Drinks, fatty meats, overeating, and any food that causes the veins to fill with blood should be avoided until the swelling subsides and the possibility of fluid buildup at the site is lessened.
Then, the patient should return to his usual regimen. If the broken bone begins to knit, the patient should eat foods that are nourishing, dense, and strong, with a viscous quality, such as dates, rice, heads of grain, and ox tripe. Eggs, soft fish, thick drinks, and similar foods will speed up and improve the healing of the fracture.  Be aware that fractured bones in strong men and elderly individuals may never fully rejoin as they were originally.
Due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, and even though bones that were very flexible, like those of young children, might knit together, nature produces a substance resembling glue on all sides of the fractured bone.  This thick substance adheres to and holds the pieces firmly together.
Thus binding the pieces together until it reaches the original strength and firmness, so that nothing hinders its function.
For this reason, the patient's diet should consist of foods that are strong, viscous, and thick, as previously mentioned.  Know that fractures vary according to the affected bone, since a fracture in the leg is different from a fracture in the head, and a fracture in the chest differs from a fracture in the back.
Likewise, all other organs differ from one another.  We will discuss each type of fracture in detail in its own section, and the type of fracture itself may also differ.
Because the fracture may be a simple break without fragments, or it may be lengthwise with fragments, some detached, some not.  The fracture may also occur with a wound and skin tearing, or it may be a minor crack.
Each type has a specific method of treatment, as will be detailed in its proper place.  Signs of a broken bone include its crookedness, unevenness, visibility, and the grating sound when touched with the hand.
If there is no visible crookedness, no grating sound, no pain or discomfort when the bone is touched, and the patient does not experience much pain, there is no fracture.  It could be a sprain or a minor break or crack, and it should not be moved at all by pulling or probing.
Instead, apply appropriate medicines, as will be mentioned later, to the area, then gently bind it.  Know that if the bone is fractured and splintered in two, but without fragments, then each part has moved away from its companion.
You should promptly realign and straighten the bone before a hot swelling occurs. If a hot swelling does occur, leave it for a few days until it subsides, then realign it by any gentle means possible.
Know that setting and straightening a bone without splinters is easier.  Then it is bound, as will be described later. If the bone has splinters, the fractured limb (either an arm or a leg) must be stretched from both sides.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with both ropes and hands. Position the limb on a flat surface in its natural shape. Once the fractured bone parts have been stretched, gently return the protruding parts to their places by any means possible.
Make every effort to avoid causing pain or suffering to the patient.  Strive to join the two bone parts together in the best possible position.  At that time, you should touch and feel the bones with your hand.  If you find something amiss, correct and straighten it to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive stretching and forceful prodding, as many ignorant people do.  Often, they cause a hot swelling or inflammation in the limb, as I have observed repeatedly from their actions.
After setting, perfecting, and binding the limb, keep it still and quiet. Warn the patient not to move it during waking or sleeping hours, or when turning over, or while experiencing discomfort, or during bowel movements, or with any other movement to the greatest extent possible.  Ensure that the limb's position prevents pain.
If the patient feels pain or discomfort in a particular position of the limb, he should change that position to one where he feels no pain.  In doing so, he should also ensure that the new position is straight and level.
So that no crookedness occurs in the limb if it is forcibly straightened.  Now, regarding how to bind a fractured limb, as I am describing it to you, know that fractured limbs vary in size, shape, and configuration.  Small ones, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and similar, are...
The bandages should be gently applied for small limbs, such as the arm and fingers.  For larger limbs, like the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be firm and wide, since a broad bandage is necessary for a large limb, firmly binding it on all sides equally, without any gaps.
Then, after completing the setting, apply the appropriate plaster. Gently apply the plaster to the fracture site.  Then, begin wrapping the bandage around the fracture three or four times, depending on the limb's needs.  Slightly tighten the bandage, then continue wrapping towards the upper portion of the fracture.
Tighten the bandage less than you tightened it on the fracture site.  Then, move the wrapping away from the fracture a little, and gradually loosen the tension until the correct alignment is achieved.  Then take another bandage and wrap it also around the fracture site.
Wrap further, moving the wrap towards the lower portion of the fracture.  Maintain the tension and looseness of the wrapping as described for the initial upper wrap.  Then, place padding of soft material or cloth between the bandages to correct any misalignment of the fracture.
If there is misalignment, then do not add anything.  Then, wrap another bandage around it.  Then, apply firm splints to these bandages, if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or inflammation, apply something to reduce the swelling and inflammation. Leave it for a few days. Then, apply the splints at that time. The splints should be cut from wide, flat reeds, skillfully prepared, or from a kind of wood.
Made from pine, palm leaves, reeds, or similar readily available materials.  The splint should be of a uniform size and shape in this manner.
However, the splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the others.  The length of the splint should be appropriate to the size of the fractured limb.  Image of the splint:.
Then, tighten the splints with another bandage, in the same way as the first. Then, tie them securely from above with strong threads, as described previously, ensuring the tightening is concentrated on the fracture site. The tighter the wrapping, the closer it is to the fracture.
The threads should be of medium thickness and should be made of damp linen, in particular.  For threads to be thick, as observed with the actions of the ignorant who use twisted linen strips, is a serious error.
Because the tightening with them deviates from the proper level, and thin threads are also unsuitable, as you cannot achieve the desired tightening with them.  There should not be less than a finger's width between splints.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after tightening in the correct places, place soft padding, or fluffy wool, underneath them so that nothing causes him harm.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and a skin tear has occurred, we will address this separately.
Know that not every fractured limb should be splinted from the very first day.  If the limb is large, splints should not be applied until five or seven days, or longer, depending on your assurance that inflammation will not occur.
This is a description of the bandages used by the ancients to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains.  It is a general, concise bandage that sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, as it is neither overly hot nor cold.
Take flour dust, the residue from the millstones, knead it as it is without sifting it with egg whites. Make the dough neither thick nor thin, then bake it.
Another bandage for fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take ten dirhams each of gum, frankincense, acacia, raisin, mastic, and myrrh; five dirhams each of aloes and senna; twenty dirhams of ebony; and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Roman clay. Grind all the ingredients together and mix with ebony water or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot.  This bandage, then, is well-made, quickly sets broken bones, and is suitable for most people due to its moderate qualities.
Another bandage useful for fractures and sprains: take ten dirhams each of mastic, gum, and white hellebore; five dirhams each of myrrh and senna; six dirhams of acacia; and twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind all together finely, sift, mix with water or egg white, and use.
A bandage for dislocated joints and bones, relieving the pain that accompanies them, and for bone fractures: take prepared wool, dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and place it on the affected area. This bandage does not have the strength to set a fracture.
However, it is excellent for relieving hot swelling and pain, particularly. Another bandage to set a broken bone: take fig leaf and wild poppy leaf, grind them together, and apply the paste. Another concise bandage for the repair of a bone fracture.
If you want to treat the remaining swelling, take parts of hellebore root, chamomile, violet, and quince flour, grind them all together, and mix with ointment if the limb is not inflamed. If it is inflamed, mix with coriander water or water and apply.
Another stronger resolving bandage than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs after a bone injury: take parts of hellebore root, flax seed, fenugreek, rosemary, violet, and chamomile.
Grind all together and mix with vinegar water, or fresh water, or ointment, depending on the heat of the limb and the calming of the heat.  As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that this should be applied to a fractured limb during setting.
Except for the plaster made of wax and oil only, which should be of medium thickness.  Galen believed that things with dryness and some heat, such as myrrh, licorice, and frankincense, should be applied to the fractured limb during setting.
A remedy for weakness and pain: take mugwort, chickpeas, shaved human hair or bird feathers, hellebore, and salt, all equal parts. Grind, sift, mix, and apply as a bandage.  As for the amount of bandaging necessary...
Then, it should be removed.  Observe; if the patient experiences no pain, no rubbing, and no shifting of the fractured bone from its place, do not remove it for many days. However, if severe rubbing, bothersome pain, or swelling occurs at the site,
Then immediately remove it and do not delay.  Remove the bandage. Then, take a soft cloth or a damp sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area until the itching and pain subside, and then allow the limb to rest for an hour.
Then, apply softened wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bandage it overnight.  This will alleviate the hot swelling, reduce the limb's swelling, and ease the pain.  Then, gently reapply a light bandage, without the initial tight pressure.
And treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and puffiness, and all the symptoms have disappeared completely and you need a bandage and pressure, then reapply it as you did originally.  If nothing of what we have mentioned happens in the limb,
Then do not remove it until after three, four, five, or seven days.  Sometimes it can be left for twenty days.  All of this depends on the condition of the limb, as we said, until the fracture is fixed and the flesh has begun to heal over it.
Then, at that time, increase the pressure beyond your original pressure. Also, increase the nourishment for the sick person, as previously mentioned.  If you see that the fracture site has become more dry and thin than is appropriate, then know that nourishment is not reaching it.
Then moisten it with lukewarm water every time you remove it, and do this every three days.  Slightly lessen the pressure.  By doing this, nourishment will reach the limb, and it will heal quickly.  As for what the ignorant among the fixers do, in breaking the limb again...
For if it is not first set properly, and is set crooked, this is a mistake on their part, and a great deception.  Even if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it.  I have seen no trace of it in any of them at all. The correct approach is not to do it.
The second chapter.
Concerning fractures occurring in the head.
Fractures of the head are numerous, their shapes diverse, and their causes varied. Some fractures occur from a sword blow, and these may be such that the entire bone is broken down to the peritoneum, which is beneath the bone. As is done to wood by carpenters.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a carpenter's fracture.  Alternatively, the sword might only sever part of the bone, and only its surface is broken, without penetrating through the bone completely.  This type of fracture is called a simple fracture.  The wound of these fractures may be large or small.
Some fractures are caused by a blow from a stone or a fall onto a stone or similar object, resulting in a contusion or abrasion. This fracture may be penetrating, having approached the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be on the surface of the bone.
The wound of these fractures also may be large or small.  Some fractures are hidden within the bone, subtle hairline cracks.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture.  A fracture can also result from a fall or a blow from a stone or similar object, where a portion of the bone is driven inward, creating a depression, much like how a blow to copper can cause a portion to be driven inward.
This is most common in the soft, spongy bone of children's heads.  All these types of fractures may have detached or non-detached fragments.  We will discuss the treatment of each in its appropriate place.  All these fracture types are recognizable through examination.
Their examination involves probing and removing any decayed flesh.  A hairline fracture is recognized by examining the bone, rubbing and staining it with ink; the fracture will appear black.  Treatment of the fracture first involves looking at the patient's symptoms.
If you see evident symptoms of danger, such as vomiting of bile, prostration, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, red and strained eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat them.  In most cases, death is inevitable with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that are not alarming and hope for recovery, then proceed with treatment.  If the injured person comes to you soon after the injury, particularly in winter...
In any case, you should diligently remove the bone before the fourteenth day. If it is in the summer, you should hasten the removal of the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane beneath the bone decays and causes the symptoms we described.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is also crushing and laceration, you must remove the crushed and lacerated portion, as I am describing to you, which is to shave the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in any way possible, according to the shape of the wound and the patient's condition.  If during the exposure you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling, address it appropriately.
This involves packing the area with rags dipped in a mixture of rosewater and ointment, and cleaning the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding is controlled.  Then proceed to manipulate and remove the bone, using one of two methods.
One method is to cut the bone with a thin, narrow blade, in this manner:
Then use another blade, slightly wider than the first, in this manner:
Then use yet another blade, wider still than the second.  You should have a set of blades of varying widths and lengths, with extremely sharp edges, made of Indian steel or good quality tempered steel.
Use gentle pressure when using the blades, so as not to jar the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and solid, it is necessary to pierce around it with awls, called "non-dipping awls," before using the blades.
Because they do not penetrate beyond the skull's edge, as the awl's head, below its sharp point, is round, like a ring or small circle, preventing it from sinking and passing through the thickness of the bone.
You should have a large selection of these awls, each suitable for the thickness of the bone, so that for each skull, you have an awl whose sharp point is the correct length and short for the thickness of that skull.  Here is a picture of three types. Of awls: large, medium, and small.
To pierce around the fractured bone, place the awl on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know the bone has been pierced. Then, move the awl to another location, keeping the distance between each hole about the thickness of a reed or similar.
Then, with the cutters, cut between each pair of holes, doing so as gently as possible, as we said, until you remove the bone, either by hand or with some other tool you have prepared for the purpose.
Such as splints and delicate forceps.  You should be very careful that the awl or cutter does not touch the peritoneum. If you have smoothed the bone and separated it from the peritoneum, if it was adhered to it, and removed it, then it should be cleaned.
Smooth any roughness remaining on the bone with another tool similar to a cutter, but it should be finer and more delicate than the other cutters.  If any small pieces of bone or fragments remain, remove them gently using the tools you have.
Then treat the wound afterward with the dressings and ointments that are mentioned later. The other approach to the work is very straightforward, free of risk; Galen mentioned and praised it greatly.  This is his statement. First, you should begin by exposing the part of the bone in the area where the fracture is most severe and prominent.  Once you have exposed that part, place the tip of this lens-shaped cutter beneath it.  This is its form:
The lens-shaped part of it should be smooth, not cutting anything, and the sharp part should have its sharp edges extended lengthwise, as you see, so that the lens-shaped part rests against the peritoneum and the sharp edge of the cutter faces the bone.  Then strike the cutter from one side.
With a small hammer, so that all the bone is cut gently as it rotates, and you are safe from injuring the membrane, nothing frightening will happen, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were asleep.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in certain places, scrape it off using the tip of the lens-shaped cutter itself, removing it gently.  It will detach without harm or fear.
If the fracture of the bone did not reach the membrane, and the broken part of the bone was its surface, remaining rough and with splinters, it is necessary to remove that roughness and those splinters with rasps of different sizes that you have prepared, so that you can use the most suitable one for each location, according to what the work indicates.
The same fractured bone and its shape, and you should first use the widest rasps on the bone for scraping, then use those that are narrower, and continue doing this systematically until you reach the use of the smallest and thinnest ones.
As for the other small, hairline fractures and minor breaks, each one should be treated according to what will lead to its healing, something that is not hidden from anyone with even a minimal degree of proficiency in this craft, and who has studied what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, you should take a linen cloth sized to the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.  Then take another cloth, folded or triangular. Soak it in rose water and rose oil, place it on the first cloth, and do this with the least possible weight to avoid pressing on the peritoneum. Then, use a wide bandage over this, tightening only as much as needed to hold the wound in place.
Leave it with this treatment for one or two days until you are sure the inflammation subsides, then remove the bandage and subsequently apply remedies that have a drying effect, such as iris roots, caraway powder, kender and zeraوند powder, and similar ones.  These remedies should be made into a paste.
Apply the paste, as it is, to the wound.  In general, use a remedy that cleanses but does not sting.  During your treatment of the wound, make every effort to ensure that it is clean, free from oiliness, dirt, or pus. Do not allow pus to accumulate in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the brain membrane, it corrupts and rots it, causing a great affliction for the patient. This can occur in the meninges of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if treatment is neglected.
If a dark discoloration appears on its surface, and if the patient presents with the symptoms we mentioned, know that he is doomed. If the discoloration was caused by a remedy applied to the area, and the potency of that remedy was such that it produced this discoloration, then...
You should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them thoroughly, and then apply the mixture to a cloth.  Place the cloth on the meninges, and then treat it with the appropriate methods of treatment until it heals.
Chapter Three.
In the setting of a fractured nose.
Know that only the upper portions of the nose, either both or one, can break, because they are bones. The lower part is cartilaginous and does not break, but may be bruised, bent, or perforated.
If one of its parts breaks, you should insert the little finger into the nostril to straighten the fracture from inside. Use your index and thumb to correct the alignment from outside, until the nose is restored to its natural shape. Be gentle and careful not to cause pain to the patient.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, it should be straightened with a blunt-ended instrument.  If the fracture is in both sides, do the same.  He should address the fracture on the first day after the injury.
If possible, or else after seven to ten days, when the hot swelling has subsided, insert a linen wick into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or two wicks if it is on both sides.
The wicks should be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some early surgeons recommended soaking the wicks in oil, changing them daily.  I, however, do not agree with this; the wicks should be soaked in beaten egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the wicks in place until the bone has set and the cartilage has hardened.  After the wicks, one may insert goose feather tubes wrapped in soft linen into the nasal cavity where the wicks were placed.  This will hold the nose fracture more firmly and prevent the patient from having difficulty breathing.
This is not essential. You may choose to use the wicks, or not. If a hot swelling appears on the nose during your treatment, bandage the nose with a linen cloth or a cotton pad dipped in vinegar, rose oil, or a diachylon ointment.
If no hot swelling appears, then bandage the outside of the nose with a paste of fine semolina and finely ground kender seeds mixed with beaten egg white.  Then apply a soft bandage.  Do not tie the nose at all, if the nasal bones are fractured in small pieces.
Or if the bones have splintered, one must carefully remove them with the appropriate instrument, then suture the cleft and treat it with ointments that promote healing and suppuration. If a wound occurs inside the nose, one should treat it with wicks and use lead tubes. Until healed.
Fourth Chapter.
On the setting of a fractured lower jaw.
If the lower jaw is fractured, but the fracture is not accompanied by an open wound, and if the fracture is only from the outside, without a double fracture and the jaw bending inward, its identification will be easier.
If the fracture is in the right side, the index finger of the left hand should be inserted into the patient's mouth.  Likewise, if the fracture is in the left side, the index finger of the right hand should be inserted, and gently lift the prominence of the fracture from the inside to the outside.
With your other hand outside the bone, you control its alignment. If the jaw fracture has fractured in two places, then traction should be applied from both sides in a straight line until its alignment is achieved. If it has occurred in the teeth, it should be treated with gentle force.
Or if it has splintered, tie together the fragments that you hope will remain intact with a gold, silver, or silk thread.  Then place a bandage over the fractured jaw, then fold a cloth over that, and place a large, tight splint, or a piece of leather the length of the jaw over it. Then tie it from above according to how you manage to tie it and to match its closure so that it does not dislodge, and instruct the patient to rest and be quiet.  Make his food soft.  If you suspect that something has changed in its shape in any way, promptly reopen it on the third day.
Then tie it from above according to how you manage to tie it and to match its closure so that it does not dislodge, and instruct the patient to rest and be quiet.  Make his food soft.  If you suspect that something has changed in its shape in any way, promptly reopen it on the third day. Then correct what you have bandaged with mill dust mixed with egg white or semolina flour, after removing the bandage. Place a soft compress on the dressing, and as long as that dressing adheres to it and the bone's condition has not changed, leave it.
Do not remove it until it heals and the fracture strengthens.  Often, this fracture strengthens in three weeks. If a hot swelling appears during that time, use the remedies we have mentioned repeatedly to alleviate it until the swelling subsides.
And if the fracture is accompanied by an open wound, then if a fragment or fragments of bone have separated, gently remove those fragments with the tools that are suitable for you. If the wound opening is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as needed.
Then, if you have removed the fragments and there is nothing left, suture the wound opening if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for it. And close the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the setting of the collarbone if it is fractured.
The collarbone is most frequently fractured from the front, from the end of the shoulder blade. Its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it breaks and splinters into two pieces without producing fragments, which is the easiest to set;
Or the fracture may produce fragments, which is more difficult to set; or the fracture may occur with a wound.  If the fracture is without a wound, two assistants should be brought. One should hold the arm adjacent to the fractured collarbone, and the other should extend the neck in the opposite direction.
Then straighten the fracture with your fingers until it is properly shaped and free of protuberances or irregularities. If you need more extension, you should place a ball of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit.
Adjust the bone as needed, extending and elevating the collarbone, and pressing the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you cannot pull the end of the collarbone outward because it has sunk inward, the patient should lie on their back.
A medium-sized cushion is placed under the patient's shoulder blade. The assistant presses down on the patient's shoulder blade to elevate the recessed portion of the collarbone.  Then, correct and straighten the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the collarbone has broken off and is moving, you should carefully remove it. If the fragment is embedded in the bone, you must carefully cut it out using one of the instruments prepared for this purpose. After placing the instrument that protects the diaphragm beneath the collarbone, an instrument made of wood or iron, which is illustrated as follows:
It resembles a spoon, without a curve. Its width should be adjusted according to the size of the bone, and its length should also be determined according to the work you need to do. It should have two ends, as you see one end wider, and the other narrower.
If the wound you made when removing the bone fragment is wide and inflammation is present, suture the edges of the wound. If the wound is minor or if you fear severe inflammation, close the wound with sutures and dressings appropriate for the size of the wound.
If a hot inflammation appears, soak the dressing in rosewater and vinegar or a drink, and apply it.  As for bracing a bone, if there is no wound or incision, apply a dressing made from mill dust and egg white to the bone. Place a soft pad over it, and then place a ball under his armpit if needed.  Then take a very long turban, with a width of approximately one span, or so.  Then apply a folded bandage over the pad and dressing.  Then take a splint made of thin board. Make it [the splint] three fingers wide and the same length. Then wrap it in a cloth, and then wrap that cloth and splint around the part of the turban that covers the fracture site.  Then wrap the turban around the fracture, just as it is wound around. And tie it around his neck, and under his healthy armpit and under his injured armpit, returning it repeatedly to each side.  How you see that the tightening secures the fracture firmly is clear to you.
And the entire purpose is that the splint should not move from the fractured bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day.  Whenever the ligament relaxes and you see the splint has moved, correct it and tighten the bandage.  Then make the patient sleep on their back, and place a small pillow under their armpit while they sleep at night.
To elevate his arm from his side, so the fractured clavicle rises with the shoulder or tie his arm to his neck.  Do not loosen the bandage unless a wound or swelling occurs at the site within twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see cause for it. Maintain the tightening and leave it until the fracture of the collarbone sets and becomes firm, strengthening further in twenty-eight days. And in some people, it may be in less than that.
Chapter Six.
On the reduction of a fractured shoulder.  The shoulder rarely fractures in its wider portion, but rather its parts fracture.  If a part or the middle is fractured, this is determined by touch; then, according to the nature of the fracture, apply a splint.
Reduce it and return it to its natural shape by any means possible, then apply mill dust, egg white, and soft plaster to the area. Place a folded cloth bandage over that, and then apply a wide splint of wood.
Make the splint as wide as the entire shoulder or slightly wider.  If, under the splint, there is a protrusion on any part of the shoulder, smooth that protrusion with soft plaster so that the splint lies flat.  Then secure it from above with a long bandage.
Tighten the bandage firmly and secure the splint so it doesn't shift.  Examine the bandage daily; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it moves.  Let the patient lie on their sound side.  The shoulder will be healed in twenty days.
One or twenty-five days. When this time is complete, remove the bandage and you will be secure, for it is among the bones that one need not fear its splintering or displacement. If a fragment of bone protrudes, and it is piercing the skin, then cut over it and remove it. Do as described for a fractured collarbone in order to relieve any inflammation, if such a thing occurs.
Chapter Seven.
In setting a fractured rib.
The chest may break in the middle, though this is rare.  Its extremities, however, are more likely to fracture and splinter.  Among its symptoms, if the middle breaks, it will tilt downward, and severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing will occur.
Perhaps blood will be coughed up, and the depression of the fractured bone will become apparent to the touch.  To set it, the patient must lie on their back, with a cushion between their shoulder blades.  Then, their sides must be compressed, and the ribs gathered together with the hands from both sides.  Care must be taken to straighten them out on every possible aspect.
And hold until the bone returns to its proper shape.  Then apply bandages and splints and place a splint of thin, light wood from poplar, willow, or the like, wrapped in cloth, on top. Then, carefully tie it to the fractured bone so it does not shift, and wrap the bandage around the back several times, firmly tightening it.  The bandage should be checked frequently, and tightened whenever it loosens.
If the injury requires it, such as due to ulceration, pain, or swelling, immediately remove it, take off the bandage, and treat any condition that has developed. Then replace the bandage if it is deemed appropriate. Apply this to the affected area and keep it firm until it heals.
Chapter Eight.
In the setting of fractured ribs, know that fractures typically occur in the thick parts of the ribs adjacent to the spine and along their anterior edges.  This is because these areas are cartilaginous and easily injured.  Recognition of this is obvious to touch when palpating.
To treat it, align the fracture with the fingers in the appropriate manner until the shape is restored. Then bandage and splint the fractured bone if necessary. If the rib fracture is inward, it will cause severe pain.
And the pain is like the pain experienced by someone with pleurisy, for the bone punctures the diaphragm, causing difficulty breathing, coughing, and significant spitting of blood.  This is a difficult condition to treat, and many solutions have been tried in the past.
Some have said that the patient's diet should include foods that produce gas and wind, to inflate the abdomen and push the fracture outward. We do not support this, for fear of exacerbating inflammation if it has not already occurred, and worsening it if it has.
Some have said to apply a cupping glass to the area and then vigorously suction it. While this seems logical, there is concern that the cupping glass might inadvertently draw more fluids to the weakened area.  Others have said that the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
The ribs are then stitched together until they fill out, creating an even band when wrapped around.  Thereafter, the patient is treated for pleurisy, through diet and medication.  If the patient is severely afflicted, it is unbearable. The bone was piercing the diaphragm painfully, and we feared for the patient.  Therefore, we should incise the area, expose the fractured rib, then place beneath it the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which we have previously described.  We should gently cut and remove the bone.
Then, if the wound is large, we stitch the edges together and treat it with ointments until it heals.  If inflammation occurs during this time, immediately apply rose-oil-soaked bandages to the affected area and treat the patient internally as well to relieve the inflammation.
He should lie on the side on which he sleeps more easily until he is healed.
Chapter Nine.
On the setting of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Concerning the bones of the neck, if a fracture occurs, this is infrequent.  More often, the neck is injured by contusions.  The same is true for the vertebrae of the spine.  If such an injury occurs to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not... If you observe that his hands have become relaxed, numb, and lifeless, and he cannot move, extend, or close them; and if you pinch or prick them with a needle, he feels no sensation or pain, then know that in most cases, he will not recover, and he is likely to die.
However, if he can move them and feels the pinching and pricking, know that the spinal cord has been spared, and the patient will recover with treatment.  If a similar injury occurs to the vertebrae of the back, and you want to know if it will also recover...
Then examine his legs. If you see that they have become relaxed and show the same signs as the hands, and when he lies on his back, urine and feces are expelled involuntarily, and when he lies on his stomach, urine is expelled involuntarily... And if he lies on his back and attempts to urinate, he cannot do so, then know that he is doomed, and do not bother with treatment.  If none of these symptoms occur, the matter is less serious.  Treatment for such cases involves trying to relieve the inflamed swelling.
By applying rose oil, alone or mixed with roasted egg yolks, to the affected vertebrae three times a day, until the inflammation subsides.  Then apply one of the strengthening, dry dressings to the area and bind it with a bandage.  Instruct him to rest and remain still.
He should sleep only on the side that does not cause pain until he is healed. If a splinter or something else detached from the bone during the injury, it is necessary to cut through the skin and remove that detached bone. Then, if the wound is large, stitch the edges together.  Then treat with healing ointments until healed.  If the last bone of the coccyx (tailbone) is fractured, then it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the rectum.
Align the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible and achieve alignment.  Then apply a dressing and splint, if necessary, and bind it tightly.
If you feel a fractured splinter within it, cut open the area and remove it.  Treat the wound with the previous methods until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a hip fracture.
Hip bones rarely fracture. If they do, the fracture involves fragmentation at the extremities, longitudinal splitting, and inward tilting.  The affected individual experiences pain, stabbing, and numbness in the leg on the fractured side.
To set it, run your hand over it until you ascertain the nature of the fracture.  If the fracture is only at the extremities, then adjust the fracture to resemble its original shape as best as possible.
If the fracture is longitudinal or has tilted inward, lay the patient on their stomach to facilitate setting the fracture.  Once you have adjusted it, apply a bandage, then a splint of wood or leather and secure it tightly.
Do not fear the fracture shifting or the splint loosening.  Fill in any hollows in the lower back with padding to ensure the splint lies flat.  Instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their sound side, if a hot swelling appears.
Refrain from manipulating or setting it until the hot swelling subsides.  Apply what is appropriate to soothe it, as previously mentioned.  Then resume setting and securing it properly.  If fragments or splinters are present in the bone, they should not be removed.
Do not touch them, but adjust them from the outside, as we said, and leave the securing in place until healing occurs.
Chapter Eleven.
On the setting of a fractured humerus.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder.  If it is fractured, set it by one of two methods: one is to take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness, in this form:
And tie straps to its ends.  Then, suspend it from a high point. The patient sits on a chair, and then places their fractured arm over the stick so that their armpit is positioned at the middle curve of the stick. Then, hang a heavy object from above it.
Or, an attendant lowers it (the arm) and the physician straightens the fracture with his hands until the fracture is set correctly.  The other method is that the patient lies on their back and their arm is suspended from their neck by a strap.
Then, instruct two attendants: one to hold the upper part of the fracture in their hands and the other to hold the lower part, and each of them to pull in their respective direction.  If you want the pulling to be stronger, tie a strap beneath the fracture and one above it, and have each attendant pull in their respective direction.
If the fracture is near the shoulder, the middle of the strap should be under the armpit, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow; likewise, if the fracture is near the elbow, the straps should be in that location and at the elbow itself.
Then, gently set the fracture without force, until the fracture is properly aligned and well-united.  Then tighten it, unless a hot swelling arises.  If a hot swelling arises, leave the tightening until the seventh day. Apply soft, dampened wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides.  Then tighten it.  The method of tightening is to place the bandage over the fracture, then place a new cloth wrap over the bandage. Then bring the arm up to the upper arm and place the hand open against the shoulder.
Hold the cloths and the tightening on the upper arm and the arm, so that the arm acts as splints if nothing prevents you from doing so and if nothing of the fractured bone has changed for you. If you fear that something of it will change for you, then use splints.
Place a splint over the fracture itself, one that is wider and stronger than the other splints.  Let there be a finger's width between each splint.  Let the length of the splints be according to the fracture, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
Then tighten the splints with the tightening mentioned in the first section.
The tightening should be on the fracture site, the strongest.
The farther from the fracture, the less the tightening.  If you see the placement of the splints and the tightening as we described in the moment of setting the limb, then do it.
If you fear a hot swelling, leave the tightening and splints until the seventh day, as we said. Then examine the ligaments every three days, lest a rash or puffiness occur, or food be prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening.  Correct all of that as we mentioned.
If you are certain that none of that will occur, do not loosen the bandages until many days later.  The patient should lie on their back, their hand on their stomach.  A padded, moderate arm sling filled with wool should be placed under the armpit.
Examine at all times, night or day, lest the fractured limb's shape shifts or the bandage loosens.  Correct all of this with your effort.  Make the patient's diet as we previously described, first gentle, until the bone is strong.
Then the patient's diet should be made thicker.  The arm and leg usually become strong in forty days. At that time, the bandages should be loosened, and a bath used, and treated with ointments suitable for this, if the fracture is a severe one.
Do not loosen the bandages until fifty days or two months.
The Twelfth Chapter.
On the setting of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called the radius.  One is small, being the one nearest the thumb, and the other is large, being positioned under the smaller one, at its lower end.  Sometimes only the larger radius is fractured, or the smaller one alone, or both may be fractured.
When the upper small radius is fractured, its setting is easy and its healing quicker. When the lower radius is fractured, the fracture is bad, and healing difficult. The worst case is when both bones are fractured. If the upper small radius is fractured,
Therefore, the physician, when setting it, should gently apply a slight pull to align it.  If the large radius is fractured, a stronger pull is necessary. If both radii are fractured, an exceptionally strong pull is necessary.
The hand should be positioned, when setting and pulling, stretched out on a cushion. The thumb of the hand should be positioned higher than all the fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the other fingers.  The patient should sit upright.
The cushion should be at a height so that the patient does not exert himself.
Then, one attendant supports the arm from below, either by hand or with a bandage, and another attendant supports it from above.  Then, the physician aligns the bone until it is restored to the best possible shape.  If the fracture has splinters, they are carefully removed.
Return each splinter to its place to the best of your ability.  If a splinter protrudes, pierces the skin, and cannot be set, make an incision over it and remove it using the method described previously.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, a separate section has been dedicated to this.
Treat any resulting inflammation from the initial setting with a poultice of rose oil and white wax, applied on a linen cloth of medium thickness.  Apply gentle pressure until the swelling subsides.
Remove the poultice and apply a bandage made from mill dust and egg white.  Then apply the splints.  The splint over the fractured area should be wider and stronger.  Know that the arm usually requires six splints.
The fracture may be in one radius or both radii.  Then, make the traction over the fracture site stronger and tighter.  As you increase the traction upwards or downwards, gradually lessen the tension, as described at the beginning of this section.
Use soft, damp linen bandages to wrap the fracture; they should not be excessively stiff.  The thread used for traction should be linen, of medium thickness as previously described.  Inspect the limb and ligaments after several days.
If any irritation develops on the limb, such as itching, it should be soothed with warm water.  The limb should be left untensioned for a night to rest, then traction resumed.
If the traction has become slack and the bone has shifted, or something similar has occurred, correct it to the best of your ability.  Also, if the limb is deprived of nourishment due to excessive traction, reduce the tension slightly and leave it for several days to allow nourishment to reach it, then re-apply traction.
If no problem mentioned above arises, the splint should not be removed for twenty days or thereabouts. Then, suspend the patient's arm from their neck, keeping the arm straight.  The patient must avoid strenuous or erratic movements.  The patient should sleep on their back.
Know that this arm fracture is typically set within thirty, or thirty-two days, perhaps even twenty-eight days, all depending on the individual's temperament and strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On setting fractures of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpals and phalanges rarely fracture, but are often bruised.  When the hand suffers a fracture or a bruise...
The patient should sit on the ground, with a chair in front of him/her, level with the ground.
Then, placing the hand outstretched on the chair, the bone-setter extends the fractured bone and the physician straightens it until it is properly aligned.  Then, if no hot swelling occurs, the bandage and splint should be applied, followed by a splint to cover the area.
It should be enclosed in soft cloth. If the fracture is towards the palm of the hand, make a ball-shaped form of cloth, and instruct the patient to hold it with their fractured hand, and then tie it with a long cloth.
Let the splint be of soft leather, so that the skin can heal while the entire hand is bent; and tie it as is necessary.  If the fracture is outwards, then a splint should be placed above and another below the hand to keep the hand open and upright.
Then, the splint is tightened as the hand turns, and the fingers are bound together with bandages. If the fracture is in one of the fingers, if it is the thumb, it should be straightened correctly and tied with the hand, or if desired, a small upright splint should be made to support the fracture.
It should not be moved. If the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, ring, or pinky fingers, they should be straightened and bound with the adjacent healthy finger, or all bound together, which is better, or a small upright splint placed on them.
As we said regarding the thumb, and examine during and after the setting of your fracture, and treat any swelling if necessary, as we have repeatedly described.
Fourteenth Chapter.
On the setting of a fractured femur.
The thighbone often fractures and is easily felt, as it shifts back and forth.  Its setting involves tying a bandage above the fracture and another below, with the patient lying on their face.
Then each attendant pulls the bandage taut in its direction, ensuring that the bandage is straight if the fracture is in the middle of the bone, but if it is near the origin of the thigh, a soft bandage made of wool or similar material should be used.
Near the thigh's origin, towards the pubic area, the pull should be upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.  Likewise, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be placed near the knee to pull downwards, then the physician aligns the bone with both hands, restoring it to its natural shape.
The bone will heal well.  Then, you should maintain the dressing and tension, unless a hot swelling develops in the limb. If a swelling occurs, leave it for some days until the hot swelling subsides, then resume treatment.
For the tensioning, a wide, firm bandage should be wrapped around the fracture two or three times, leaving any excess.  Then the leg is wrapped until the heel is at the origin of the fibula.  A long thread is inserted between the thigh and the leg, near the knee from below, and the ends of the thread are brought to the top on both sides.
Then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.  Next, place splints on the thigh at the fracture site itself, and make a single splint on the leg bone.  Then fill the space between the thigh and leg with soft padding to ensure even tension.
Then begin with strong tension at the center of the fracture site, wrapping three or four times.  As you move the bandage away from the fracture site, the tension should be less, gentler, and looser.
Then, take the ends of the thread you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie them to the overlying splints.  Then, bring the thread ends down to the ankle of the leg, and use them to also tighten the ends of the splints on the other side.
So that the bandage does not shift from its place, then maintain the tension as long as the limb shows no pain, swelling, or inflammation, or similar.  If anything of the sort occurs, promptly loosen it and rectify whatever happened as we have described repeatedly.
If there is a splinter of bone protruding, then smooth it out if possible; otherwise, split the skin over it and remove it. Treat the wound as previously described until it heals.  Sometimes, this thigh fracture can be treated without including the leg in the splints.
As we have mentioned for the humerus and forearm, however,  treating it in this way will not cause the patient to limp.  If you only splint the [affected] limb without including the leg, the patient will certainly limp.
Know that the thigh takes fifty days or a little more or a little less to heal, depending on the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
In the fracture of the kneecap.
The kneecap rarely fractures, but it is often bruised. If a fracture does occur, it is either a crack or a fragmentation of its parts, and this may occur with or without a wound.
All of this is determined by examination.  The fracture is treated by aligning the separated pieces with the fingers until they come together as well as possible through gentle and careful repositioning.  Then a bandage and a circular splint are applied if necessary.
Further compression is applied according to what is appropriate.  Then all cases, like the one described in other fractures, such as inflammation and the like, are managed, each condition being addressed with the appropriate treatment until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the treatment of a fractured leg.
The leg has two bones: one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the ulna.  They are subject to the same types of fractures as the arm bones. Therefore, its treatment is like that of the arm, and the procedure is the same.  If both bones are fractured, the leg is displaced in all directions.  If the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is displaced forward.  If the thicker bone is fractured, and this happens from below, that is obvious to you.
So use traction and alignment, and bind the splints accordingly, but if the leg fracture is severe, with many fragments, the traction should be less and gentler, and apply less force to the reduction.
In treating the leg, there is something extra compared to the arm.  After aligning the splints and completing all your work, take two pieces of pinewood, similar to those used for smoothing walls or palm leaves, and place them between the gaps of the boards.
Choose pieces that are slightly thick, not thin, and make them the length of the leg from the knee down.  Then wrap each one with two layers of cloth along its length, placing one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let the length be from the knee to the bottom of the foot.  Then tie the two pieces at three points, at the ends and the middle.  With this arrangement, the leg will be prevented from tilting sideways and will be well-supported.  A wooden trough along the leg might also be used.
Place it [the leg] in this [trough] to prevent movement, and this is especially important if there is a wound as well.  Then examine the leg each day carefully for swelling or puffiness, or any other such issue. If any of this occurs, address it appropriately until it heals.  The leg bone will be set in thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
In fractures of the leg and fingers.
The heelbone is rarely fractured.  The bones of the leg may be fractured, and the fingers are also seldom fractured; rather, they are usually bruised.
If a fracture of the leg bones occurs and you see the bones protruding, have the patient place their foot flat on the ground, like walking. Then, place your foot on the protruding bones and press them down to align them.
Until they return to their proper position. Then, take the bandage and splint, place a small, flat board with two ends under the sole of the foot, and firmly bandage the foot with cloth and whatever else you need.
After three or four days, release the bandage. You will find the bones aligned, whether they were fractured or dislocated. The procedure is as described.  If some of the fingers are broken, set them and align them as described for setting the fingers of the hand.
Then, make a splint for the broken finger that is the length of the finger and slightly wider.  Place the board you described under the foot and bandage it tightly. If two, three, or more bones are broken.
Make a splint for each finger, appropriate in size and wrapped in soft cloth.  Bandage the board to the bottom of the foot, ensuring that each end of the board extends outside the sole of the foot for proper support.
You should not forget to treat all fractures with the symptoms we described, and address each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
In fractures of the woman's pubic bone and the man's pubic bone and penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, have her sit in a squatting position, then gently lean her back slightly, holding her from behind.  The midwife should then pack the vulva with cotton until it is full and feels like a ball inside.
Then, gently rock the woman and raise her pelvis slightly, and the cotton will gradually come out, forming a ball at the entrance of the vulva, and the broken bone will mend.  Then, place a pillow under her back.  When she wishes to urinate, gently remove the cotton to allow her to urinate.
Return it to its original position as it was first inserted, then return to her original pillow arrangement.  Do this for seven days or so, and it will heal. If you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a tube of reed to its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her vulva.
Then blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder inflates inside the vulva, and the fracture will mend. Afterward, pack it with cotton and continue the care as described until it heals.  Similarly, if the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, the same procedure is employed in its repair.
And the treatment is similar to what we described for fractures of the hip bone.  The proper approach to these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, is readily apparent to someone skilled and knowledgeable of this book, since the fracture itself often provides guidance.
For the correct method of treating a fractured penis, understand this:  If a man's penis is fractured, take a goose's trachea, insert the penis into it, then wrap a bandage around it.  Bind it tightly and leave it for three days or so until healed.
Chapter Nineteen.
On setting broken bones when there is a wound.
For someone who presents with a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus, or similar, one should immediately perform venesection if the conditions for venesection, as previously mentioned, permit.
If the wound is bleeding, then one should quickly cauterize it with powdered alum, if nothing else is available.  Then, begin the reduction of the fracture on that very same day, and do not delay it.
If no inflammatory swelling occurs, then if inflammatory swelling does occur, leave the reduction until the ninth day, so that the inflammatory swelling subsides.  Do not approach it at all on the third and fourth day, for it will expose it to bad symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin, exposed, then you should carefully try to return it to its place and smooth it with your hands, with gentle, slight extension. If you cannot return it and smooth it with your hands, then return it using this instrument, which is made of iron, and its length is about seven or eight fingers. And its width should match the wound.
Therefore, the physician should make three or four of them, according to the need for treatment in each type of fracture, and let them be round, with a slight thickness so that they do not bend when struck during use.
And they should be sharp-pointed, with a bend at one end, thicker at the top and gradually thinner towards the bottom.  This is its shape:
And it is called in Greek "perem", meaning a small lever.  The sharp, bent end of the instrument should be placed on the protruding bone end and used to push it back until the bone is properly aligned and the fracture ends are brought into contact.
If the fractured end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, then the end of that bone must be cut so that the instrument can hold it.  If the bone cannot be realigned as described, cut it with similar instruments as mentioned.
Or, saw it with one of the saws, as you can. Then remove any remaining roughness or thin scales from the bone.  If, after realignment, the patient experiences intense, painful discomfort, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can realign it to its natural position, do so, as you will greatly benefit the patient. Once the bone is properly set, dip a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if it is summer.  Do not place any ointments or anything greasy on the wound.
So that putrefaction and decay do not occur. Then use splints when you are finished setting the bone, and leave the wound exposed by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, to fit the size of the wound.
Beware, be extremely cautious, not to tighten the wound with the fracture.  Often, unskilled physicians do this, causing their patients either death, or ulcers, or colds.  Your tightening should be gentle and relaxed, opposite to the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or large, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we described, and the patient is experiencing distressing pain in the area, then you should not apply splints.  Make bandages of tough cloth for the area of the splints, and secure it with them.
If, after a day or two, you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, remove the cloth soaked in the drink that you placed on it. Then use the dressings and ointments we customarily use to treat wounds, such as the four-part ointment, and the like.  You should also loosen the bandage.
Examine the wound every evening and morning until it heals and is cured.  The limb should be positioned so that pus drains downwards easily.  If the wound takes many days to heal and the pus does not stop, know that there are small fragments of bone.
You should probe the wound with a probe.  Remove any such fragments that are loose.  If any fragments are not loose, and are piercing the limb and causing pain, cut them and remove them in any way possible.
If the wound develops a cold, or eating, or any other type of corruption or putrefaction, you should counteract each symptom with the corresponding treatment described in its chapter.
If a large, prominent bone such as the femur, humerus, or similar large bone is fractured, you should not attempt to pull it out or remove it. Often death results from this.  Leave it until it becomes infected; perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
On the treatment of complications arising from some fractures.
This complication often arises after the fracture heals, especially if it is near a joint. It spoils the appearance of the limb and may prevent the limb from its natural function.
If the complication is recent, use astringent remedies such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, rue, acacia, and similar substances, taking some or all of them and mixing them with an astringent potion or egg white or vinegar.
Apply it to the complication, tightly bandaging it.  Leave the bandage on for several days, then remove it and repeat the process until the complication subsides, God willing, or apply a firm lead plate over it.
Lead has the property of removing all growths on the limbs. If the complication has hardened and become severe, and necessity dictates its removal, cut it from above and remove the excess growth or scrape it away with a suitable instrument until it is gone.  Treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In the treatment of fractures, if the limb is, after being set, still thin and not as it was originally.
If a fractured bone is set and the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this may be due to many reasons. One reason is either excessive loosening and binding of the ligaments improperly, or excessive tightening of the ligaments, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb, or excessive poulticing, or excessive movements at inappropriate times, or insufficient and weak blood supply in the patient's body.
The treatment for this involves nourishing the patient and strengthening his body to increase the blood supply, using baths, bringing joy and happiness, and similar measures.  Then, applying asphalt to the limb to attract much nourishment to it, or continuing to poultice with lukewarm water. So that nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-two.
On the treatment of fractured bones, if they are reduced crookedly, preventing them from functioning properly.
So when a limb, after being reduced, shows crookedness, or a protrusion of the fractured bone, or a twisting, and the appearance of the limb is thus disfigured. However, if the limb is not prevented from its natural function, it is not appropriate to accept the assertion of those who claim to break the limb from the head, and many ignorant physicians and bone-setters in our country have done so.
This action is highly reprehensible and leads to great risk, possibly resulting in injury. However, if the crookedness and twisting are recent, it is appropriate to apply water in which relaxing herbs such as plantain leaves and root, and king's crown, and the like, have been boiled.
And apply relaxing dressings such as meticulously crafted diachylon, or take plantain root sap and mix with chicken fat and shea butter, and apply that.  Or, take ripe figs, grind them with pigeon droppings, and similar medicines called resolvents.
And the twisting will resolve with gentle, constant massage with the hands, and the limb should be moved in every direction at all times. However, if the crookedness is old, severe, and rigid, and treatment with iron is necessary.
Then, it is necessary to split it open, release the bone connection, and cut away any remaining crookedness or excess bone using delicate incisions.  Use care and attention in this process. Afterward, treat the wound with the previously mentioned remedies until healed.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is the displacement of a joint from its position, hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing the afflicted intense pain and suffering.  Therefore, when a person experiences a dislocated jaw, one must promptly attempt to relocate it.
Delay this not at all, for if delayed, swelling will occur at the affected location, forming a mass that makes relocation of the jaw difficult.  Therefore, it must not be delayed; it should not be moved or stretched while swollen, as this often leads to severe spasms and painful distress in the patient.
However, if this occurs, the patient should first be bled, then allowed to rest until the swelling subsides somewhat.  Then, the affected area should be applied with warm water and ointment.  Finally, the jaw should be gently relocated, and each affected area treated as described in its respective section.
The chapters on the jaw are also arranged, as previously discussed, from the upper to the lower parts of the body.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of the lower jaw.
The jaws dislocate rarely.  Their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they move slightly from their positions, relaxing a little; or they completely and entirely dislocate, relaxing completely. Toward the chest, so that the patient's saliva drips and he cannot retain it, nor can he close his jaw or speak coherently; but if the dislocation is slight, it will often return to its place easily.
However, if the dislocation is complete, it is necessary to return it quickly and not delay.  A servant should hold the patient's head, and the physician should place the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the patient's mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
Or if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, he should place both thumbs inside, and the rest of his fingers outside, to adjust it. He should instruct the patient to relax his jaw and allow it to go in every direction. The physician then adjusts the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its position.
If returning them is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, apply warm water and ointment compresses to make their return easier. Do not delay their return, as we have said.  If they return to their proper position and the patient's mouth is closed but still relaxed, then apply linen dressings, and a mixture of wax, ointment, and rose.
Then gently tie with a loose bandage.  The patient should sleep on their back, with their head raised between two pillows so that they do not move it to either side, nor chew anything.  Their diet should consist of soft, easily digestible foods.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is healed, they may eat as they please.  They should use gentleness and not force their mouth open when eating, drinking, or yawning, until the jaw is healed and recovered.
If the jaws, once dislocated, do not return to their proper positions, significant fever, persistent headaches, and possible abdominal distress, and perhaps repeated vomiting, may occur.  If you observe this, know that it is serious.
Many die from this condition within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On the reduction of the clavicle and shoulder joint.
The clavicle does not usually dislocate inward due to its connection to the chest. It may dislocate outward, which is evident to the touch.  To reduce it, the patient should lie on their back with their arms extended.
Then press the area firmly with your hand; it will return.  Then apply bandages and splints, and secure them.  As for the part of the clavicle near the shoulder, it rarely dislocates. If it does dislocate, it should be reduced as described above, to the best of your ability.
Then apply bandages, splints, and dressings, and instruct the patient to remain still and quiet until healed.  Using this same treatment, the shoulder joint can also be reduced if it is displaced.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On reducing the dislocation of the shoulder.
Know that the shoulder joint dislocates in three ways: one, downwards towards the armpit; two, towards the chest; and three, upwards over the shoulder, although this last is rare.
It does not dislocate to the back of the shoulder blade, nor to the front where the nerve is located.  Most commonly, it dislocates downwards towards the armpit, particularly in those with less muscle, because in them, it quickly exits and quickly re-enters.
However, in those with abundant muscle, the opposite is true; that is, it exits with difficulty and re-enters with difficulty.  Sometimes, a person may experience an injury or fall, resulting in a swollen, warm shoulder, which may be mistaken for dislocation.  It is necessary to examine this thoroughly to determine the correct diagnosis.
Then, in treating it, if the dislocation is downwards towards the armpit, when you compare the dislocated shoulder to the healthy one, you will find a noticeable difference.  You will find the head of the dislocated shoulder is tilted, and under the armpit, upon palpation, the head of the dislocated shoulder will feel like an egg.
And the injured person will not be able to raise their arm to their ear, nor to perform any other movements of the arm.  Likewise, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, this will also be evident upon palpation.
This dislocation may be easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  To reduce it, have an attendant raise the arm upwards. Then, place your thumb under the patient's armpit and pull the joint forcefully upwards, back into place, while the attendant raises and extends the arm upwards.
Then, lower it downwards, and it will return quickly. If it does not return as described, and the dislocation has been present for many days, the patient should bathe in warm water and use remedies that relax and soften tissues, such as boiling fennel, fenugreek, and king's crown in water, and apply it.
Then the patient lies on their back, and a ball of wool of moderate firmness is placed under the armpit.  The physician places their foot on the ball, grasps the patient's arm with their hand, and extends it downwards.
And the physician pushes the ball with their foot, and the joint will return to its place.  Alternatively, if you prefer, have a man taller than the patient stand beside the patient on the affected side.  The taller man should place their shoulder under the patient's armpit and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient is suspended in the air. And another attendant pulls the patient's arm downwards towards their abdomen. If the patient is light-weight, something should be tied to them to make them heavier, which will cause the joint to return at once.  The dislocation can also be reduced in other ways.
Another method is to place a long, round-headed wooden beam on the ground, like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin.  A soft cloth is placed on the top of the beam, and the patient stands along the beam with the beam placed under the patient's armpit.
Then the patient extends their arm downwards on the opposite side, and also extends their body forcefully on the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly.  If the joint is difficult to reduce with all the methods mentioned previously, then use this treatment.  Take a piece of wood approximately two cubits long. And its width should be about four fingers, and its thickness about two fingers.  It should have a rounded head so that it can easily be inserted into the armpit in this manner:
Then a soft cloth is tied to the rounded head so that the wood does not harm the patient.  Then it is placed under the armpit, and the entire arm and forearm are extended along the wood downwards. The wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and wrist.
Then the arm is placed on a crossbar.  Extend the hand downwards, leaving the rest of the body hanging from the other side. The joint will then enter its place. If it enters in any way possible, a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then a bandage prepared from mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the entire shoulder area, circling over it.  Then the ball is tied firmly under the armpit. The bandage is wrapped around the ball from above and the arm is suspended from the neck.
The arm is left undisturbed for seven days.  The patient's diet should be light, to strengthen the limb and promote healing more quickly.  Then, after seven or five days, the bandage is removed and the arm is exercised. If it is firm and does not relax, then it is healed.
If the joint frequently dislocates due to moisture or another cause, cauterization with three strips of linen should be used, as described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days, and the joint still does not hold,
If the bandage and binding are repeated several times, but the joint does not hold, and it slips and relaxes, and the patient cannot raise the arm, then know that the nerve in the shoulder head has been severed, stretched, or relaxed.  In that case, know that the joint will never hold in place.
For a dislocated jaw, located near the chest and breast and towards the back, it should be pushed and pulled with the hands until it returns.  All other binding and treatment should be used until it heals. If, after healing, there is a feeling of soreness in the area and slow movement,
The patient should use a hot bath repeatedly until the soreness subsides and returns to its normal state.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the treatment of a dislocated elbow.
The elbow joint is difficult to dislocate and also difficult to relocate.  It can dislocate in all directions, especially forward or backward.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you, as it is visible and palpable, regardless of how it has dislocated.
If you compare the dislocated elbow to the healthy one, the obvious depression of the joint will be apparent.  The arm cannot be bent, nor can the shoulder be brought to the elbow.  You should immediately relocate the dislocation before a hot swelling appears.
If a hot swelling appears, its relocation will be difficult, and it may never heal, especially if the dislocation is backward. This is the worst type of dislocation, the most painful, and often leads to death.
If it is possible to relocate it, the attendant should extend both of his arms, the physician's hand should be placed above and below the elbow, and the joint should be pushed back into place using all thumbs or the base of the hands.
If the dislocation is forward, the hand may be bent once so that the base of the palm strikes the corresponding shoulder.  If this doesn't relocate the dislocation, use very strong and forceful extension, having two attendants extend the arm.
The patient is also held by two attendants to prevent movement during the extension. Then the arm is rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or a wide bandage around it.  If the physician uses both hands to grasp the joint, he should apply ointment to make the joint easier to slip back into place.
Then the joint is forcefully pushed back into place. After relocation, a bandage containing a binding and drying agent, along with egg white, should be applied tightly. The arm should be suspended from the patient's neck and left for several days.
Then it is untied.  If the joint is firmly in place, the bandage is removed and the patient is released. If you see that the joint has not become strong, repeat the bandage and the binding and leave it for some days until it is firm, then untie it.  If the patient experiences pain after the joint is returned and untied,
If movement is difficult, use moist heat in the bath, gentle massage, and probing until it becomes flexible.  Alternatively, place a soft, fat-like pad on the joint, bind it, and leave it in place for one day and one night, then remove it and take the patient to the bath. Once the patient sweats, gently massage the joint.
Then repeat the pad application a second and third time, along with bathing, until it becomes flexible. If you prefer, place moist, ground cow dung mixed with ghee on the joint and bind it. Repeat this several times, as it will help it become flexible and return to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist often dislocates, and its reduction is easier than other joints, but it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the moment of dislocation before inflammation or a hot swelling develops in the area.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a board, have an assistant extend the arm, and the physician should place their hand on the bony prominence of the joint and push until it returns.  However, it is important to check if the dislocation has shifted to the inside of the hand.
Let the patient place the outside of their hand on the board during the extension and reduction. If the dislocation is outward, the inside of the hand should be on the board so the physician's hand is over the same bony prominence.  If it returns immediately, do so; otherwise, secure it with a dressing that relieves the swelling.
Leave it alone; do not try again, as it cannot tolerate further attempts.  After several days, reduction is impossible, and the joint will remain crooked.  This does not harm the patient, unless the hand becomes weak and cannot grip anything.
In that case, you know that the nerve is severed or bruised, and there is no remedy but to apply cauterization.  It may or may not help.  After reducing the wrist, apply the dressing we described, then bandage it and leave it for five days.
Then it is removed, and the hand is exercised.  If its movement is impaired and there is some stiffness, soften it with heated water and massage repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction.  If a finger dislocates towards the palm's surface or its underside, stretch the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumb until it returns.  Then tie the finger's head and suspend it towards the direction it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and stretch it until it stands upright that day. If it is night, tie it in the same way.  Continue to loosen it during the day and exercise it with movement, and tie it at night.  Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Likewise, if it dislocates to the underside of the hand, tie it towards the same direction and do to it your initial procedure until it heals.  Likewise, do this for any other direction of dislocation.
Chapter Thirty.
On treating a dislocated vertebra.
When a vertebra in the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no cure, for death quickly comes to the patient.
A sign of this is that the patient's stool is expelled involuntarily; he cannot control it.  Often, some of his limbs, either his legs or arms or one of them, become relaxed.  However, if only one vertebra is displaced, it often returns to its place.
And its displacement can be in four directions.  That which displaces to the rear is called a hump.  If the hump developed from childhood, there is no cure for it, and it will never heal.  However, if it developed from a fall, a blow, or something similar...
The ancients described various treatments with lengthy explanations, much of which is ultimately useless.  I have shortened this to a concise summary, sufficient to replace their extensive methods. I have clarified the meaning, explained it, and illustrated the mechanism differently from how they described and explained it.
So I say that a hump that forms in the front of the chest cannot be treated, nor can one that forms to the sides.  Only the one that forms on the back can be treated, and the method I am describing is for the patient to lie on his face.
On a flat surface near a wall, spread a damp cloth beneath him so that his chest is not harmed.  Then place a vertical plank, embedded in a hole in the ground, near his head, and another plank near his feet, at the opposite end of the surface.
A servant holds one plank, which is not fastened in the hole, and another servant holds the other plank in the same position.  Then a soft, strong bandage is wrapped around the patient's chest and under their armpits.  The end of the bandage is stretched to the plank near the patient's head and tied to it.
Then another bandage is tightened around his hips, knees, and ankles.  All the bandages are gathered and tied to the other plank near his feet.  Each servant pulls on the plank in their direction, and the planks remain in their embedded positions.
However, the planks are not secured, as we said.  The physician places his hands firmly on the hump, until it returns, or places a board on it and then leans on the board with his legs until it returns. If this treatment is unsuccessful, take a board about three cubits long.
A hole is dug in the wall, near the patient, into which the end of the board is inserted. The middle of the board is placed on the hump.  The physician places his feet on the other end of the board and pulls firmly to compress the hump.
And it returns to its place.  If you wish, you can do this with a hand-wound spiral; that is, you drive two planks into the ground, one near the patient's head at the end of the shop, and two near his feet at the other end of the shop, each a cubit long.
Let there be a span between each plank.  A hole is made in each plank through which the spiral is passed. All the wood is securely fastened to the ground so that it does not move at all. A curved stick, the spiral, in which the bandage is wound, is inserted into the holes in both planks.
At its end is a hole secured with a stick a span long, wound in, and the same is done in the other two planks. Then the bandage which was tied around the patient's chest is tightened on the spiral near his head, and the bandages tied around his legs are tightened on the spiral near his feet.
Then a servant stands by each spiral, turning the hand-crank that winds the spiral. The physician adjusts the hump as previously described. This is a picture of the spiral, the shop, and the patient.
Then, after the swelling subsides and the area is level, the dried bandage should be applied, moistened with egg white, then a compress.  Then, place a splint made of a board over the bandage, with a width of about three fingers, and a length covering the affected lump.
And over some healthy beads, then tied with the necessary bandage.  The patient should eat a soft diet until healed.  If some swelling remains in the area after healing, then the medicines that relax and soften the tissues should be used, along with the board we described, for a long time.
A lead plate may be used in this case.  If a lump appears at the end of the spine beads, one might suspect a dislocation, but it could be an extra bone that has protruded.  Do not apply this treatment, as death may result.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and not to the slight displacement and subluxation that occur in other joints.  The hip joint dislocates in four ways.
This is because it dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward.  It dislocates inward most often, and rarely forward or backward.  A sign of an inward dislocation is that if you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg will appear longer.
The knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient will be unable to bend their leg at the groin.  The area adjacent to the groin will be swollen and noticeably swollen, indicating that the head of the thigh bone has moved there.
The signs of a dislocation outward will be the opposite of these signs.  A sign of a forward dislocation is that the patient can fully extend their leg, but cannot bend it without pain, and if they try to walk, they cannot move forward.
The patient will retain urine and the groin will be painful.  When walking, they will place their weight on the heel.  A sign of a backward dislocation is that the patient cannot straighten their knee, nor can they bend it before bending the groin.  The leg will also be shorter than the other.
The groin will be relaxed, and the head of the thigh bone will be clearly visible at the hip area.  As for the reduction of these dislocations, look; if the dislocation is longstanding and the patient has not attempted reduction, and it remains in its state, then there is no treatment at all.
Therefore, it is not advisable to encounter it.  However, if the dislocation is recent, and of any of the four types, immediately rotate and extend the joint in and out, and move it right and left.  Perhaps...
If it returns without further treatment, then if it does not return this way, it is necessary to prepare a strong, capable servant who will extend the leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied above the knee, and another servant to extend it from above.
By inserting their hands under his armpits, then tightening a soft bandage around the base of the thigh, and another servant holding the end of the bandage, and the extension is either from the front from the groin toward the collarbone, or from behind towards the back.
All of them should extend at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground and remains suspended. This type of extension is common to all four types. If the dislocation returns by what we have described, otherwise, each type requires its own specific treatment, as described.
If the dislocation is inward, the patient should lie on their sound side, then a bandage is placed on the base of the thigh, between the head of the thigh and the area below the groin.
Then, the bandage is extended upward from the groin towards the upper part of the body, toward the collarbone.  A strong servant then takes hold of the thick part of the affected thigh with both arms and pulls it outward with great force, and it will return to its place.
This type is easier than other methods of restoring this limb. If this method fails, and the dislocation does not respond to this treatment, then the patient's legs should be tied together with a strong, soft bandage around the heels and knees.
Each bandage should be approximately four fingers apart. The affected leg should be extended further than the other, by about two fingers.  The patient should then be suspended from a wooden beam in the house, approximately two arms' length above the ground.
Then, a strong servant is instructed to hold the head of the thigh, and another servant is to grasp the patient, and the first servant pushing on the thigh with force, the joint will quickly return to its place.  Now, for its specific reposition if the dislocation is outward.
The patient should lie on a bed, as described for the humpbacked patient, and the bandage is tightened specifically on the affected leg and the chest.  Then, two boards are placed, one at the patient's feet and the other at the head, with an additional, strongly secured board in the middle of the bed.
Damp cloths should be wrapped around it so as not to injure the patient, and the board should be placed between the thighs to prevent downward displacement during stretching.  Then, each servant pulls in their direction and the physician straightens the hip with his hands. If the hip returns to its place.
Otherwise, place the board on it and press it as described for the humpback, except that the patient should lie on their healthy side. If the dislocation is forward, the affected leg should be stretched once while in this same position on the bed.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected hip, then presses it with the other hand.  At the same time, the pressure should be extended downwards towards the knee.  If the dislocation is backwards, the patient should not be stretched downwards.
He should be elevated from the ground, but rather placed on a firm surface, and the leg with the dislocated hip should also be positioned outward, as described in the patient's posture on the bed, lying on their face with the bandages tightened.
As we stated previously, the board should also be used to apply pressure to the area where the joint has dislocated.  When the hip joint returns properly, a sign of which is easily observed, the patient's legs should be stretched.
If you see the legs are level and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, then know that the limb has returned to its proper position.  At that point, bring the thighs together, apply the bandage, and secure it with a turban-like wrap so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days. Then, remove the bandage and splint the leg alongside the other. If you find them equal in size, know that the joint has stabilized, and allow the patient to walk. If you see any weakness,
Return and bandage it again, tightening it as you did initially. Leave it for three more days. Then remove it, and have the patient walk slowly for a number of days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On the treatment of the knee joint.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inward, outward, and downward (i.e., backward).  It does not dislocate forward.  A sign of dislocation is to instruct the patient to pull their leg towards their thigh.
If the leg does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated.  To treat all types of dislocation, have the patient sit with their legs extended, if able.  A helper should sit behind them to hold their waist and gently turn it backward.  Then sit upon their thighs.
Then place your back against his body, and position his leg between your legs.  Hold his knee with both hands, interlocking your fingers around it.  Then firmly press the sides of his knee with your hands, while another assistant extends the leg, until the knee returns to its place.
A sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh without force, smoothly.  Then bandage it, firmly securing the leg to the thigh.  Then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then remove it.  Only light walking should be done for several days, until strength returns.
If you cannot return it using the method described, then use strong traction with bandages, as described previously in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of fractured heels.
The heel may dislocate slightly or completely.  Dislocation may occur inward or outward.  A sign of dislocation is that the heel is swollen and prominent on the side to which it has dislocated.
As for treating its slight displacement, it is easily returned by gently pulling with the hands and straightening it until it returns.  If it is completely dislocated, the patient should sit, and a strong attendant should grasp it from behind, in the middle of his back.
Then, you grasp the foot with your right hand from the top and your left hand from the bottom, at the heel area.  Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand, twice. Then extend it with your left hand and push the top of the foot toward the leg with your right hand, without force.
Do this twice as described.  Then, in the third instance, push the top of the foot toward the leg while pulling on the heel. If it returns in one or two attempts like this and you see the foot is aligned, then do the procedure again. If not, redo it, as it will return.
If it does not return with the method described, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground.  Securely fix and dig a peg into the ground, placing it between their thighs, wrapped in cloth so as not to harm the patient. Then, an attendant holds the patient's thigh.
Then another attendant stretches the leg, either with their hands or with a bandage tied around the patient's neck. Each attendant stretches in the opposite direction of the other, and the peg remains between the patient's thighs, holding it so the patient's body does not pull downwards during the stretching. Then the physician straightens the joint with their hands.
Another attendant holds the healthy leg below.  If the joint returns quickly, then take the bandage and splint, and secure them tightly with bandages.  Bind the foot with a bandage to the bottom, taking care to avoid the nerve located above the heel from behind.
So that the bandage is not too tight and causes him pain.  Then leave it for two or three days.  If the bandage loosens, tighten it, then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this period, there is a risk that the joint will dislocate and not be treatable afterward. If a hot swelling appears, then use the treatments and ointments previously described in other sections of the text to resolve it.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of fractured fingers.
One should gently align the fractured parts with a slight stretch, without force.  This is not difficult but easy. If the fracture is in the toes, the patient should place their foot on a flat surface.
Or, while standing, on a board.  Then, place your foot on the protruding joint and press down firmly until it is aligned and no protrusion remains.
Then place a board under the sole of the foot, encompassing the whole foot and having two ends.  Tightly bind it for three days. Then unbind it and keep the patient from walking for many days until it is strong and a return of the fracture is prevented, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On the types of fracture that occur with a wound, or with a break, or with both.
When such a thing occurs and you attempt to treat and set it, death often follows.
Therefore, one should not undertake such treatment unless they are skilled in the art, experienced, gentle, compassionate, careful, and not rash or reckless.  One should initially use medications that relieve only hot swellings, and leave the patient alone.
O God, except that which you hope for to be free from harm with a slight illness, and some hope appears in it, then quickly return it in the beginning before the hot swelling occurs.
If the limb returns to the desired state, then use the treatment that relieves hot swellings and treat the wound with suitable drying ointments. If the jaw is fractured and pieces of bone have become detached, then remove them. Follow in this regard what we have mentioned concerning simple illnesses in the preceding passages.
Strive diligently and purify yourself from entering the path of uncertainty, as I have previously advised.  This will preserve your reputation and safeguard your standing, God willing.
