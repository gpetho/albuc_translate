Chapter eleven on the reduction of a fracture of the humerus	CHAPTER ELEVEN. On setting a fracture of the humerus.	0.71122897
The upper arm is what is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder.	The humerus is what lies between the elbow and the head of the scapula.	0.83026975
If it breaks, then set it in one of two ways.	If it is fractured it may be set in one of two ways.	0.8679971
One of them is that you take a curved, smooth stick of medium thickness in this way:	One is to take a smooth bow-shaped piece of wood of medium thickness, like this.	0.8054968
And you tie two bandages at its ends, then hang it from a high place, and the patient sits on a chair, then his broken arm is placed on the wood until his armpit is attached to the middle of the curve of the wood, then a heavy object is hung from above it or an assistant stretches it downwards, then the physician adjusts the fracture with both his hands until the fracture returns to what it should be.	You tie two bands at the two ends and then it is hung from above. The patient is to sit on a seat; then his broken arm is folded upon the piece of wood in such a way that his axilla fits into the middle of the curve of the piece of wood. Then hang a heavy weight from the arm, or have an assistant pull it downwards; then the doctor should straighten out the fracture with both hands together until it is properly reduced.	0.89655876
The other way is for the patient to lie on his back and his hand is hung from his neck with a bandage, then you order two assistants, one of them to hold what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other to hold what is below it and each of them stretches it to his side.	The other way is to make the patient lie back and to suspend his hand from his neck by a band, then you instruct two assistants. One is to grasp with both hands the arm above the fracture, and the other the arm below the fracture; and each should make extension toward himself.	0.91901493
And if you want the stretching to be stronger, tighten below the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage, and each of the assistants stretches them to their side.	And if you wish to extend more strongly, tie a band below the fracture and another above, and let each assistant pull toward himself.	0.8613887
If the fracture is close to the end of the shoulder, then the [middle] of the bandage should be under the armpit, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.	If the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder you will have to put one band beneath the axilla and the other below the fracture near the elbow.	0.72665066
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, then the bandage should be placed on that place and on the elbow itself.	Similarly, if the fracture be near the elbow you will have to put a band over the place and over the elbow itself.	0.938173
Then adjust the fracture gently without violence until the fracture is aligned as it should be and heals well, then tighten it if no hot swelling appears, but if a hot swelling appears, leave it tightened until the seventh day, and put on it clarified wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the swelling subsides, then tighten it.	Then gently and without violence straighten out the fracture until it is restored to its proper shape and fits together well, and then tighten it if no abscess occur. But if an abscess occur, leave the bandaging until the seventh day and apply raw wool soaked in vinegar and oil of roses until the abscess subsides; then bind it up.	0.91441035
The method of tightening it is to apply the dressing to the fracture, then apply a roll of new cloth over the dressing, then gather the forearm onto the upper arm itself and place his hand open on his shoulder.	The method of binding it is to apply a plaster to the fracture; then wind round the plaster a bandage of new material; then bind the forearm to the humerus, placing his hand open on his shoulder.	0.8486016
And apply the cloth and the tightening on the upper arm and forearm so that the forearm acts as splints, if nothing prevents you from doing so and nothing has changed on the broken bone.	Then apply pads and bandages to the arm and forearm so that the forearm serves instead of splints, if there is no contra-indication and you see no pathological change in the broken bone.	0.7489984
If you fear that something might change on you from that, then use splints, which is to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, and let the width of a finger be between each splint, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an increase of three fingers from each side, then tighten on the splints the tightening that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, which is that your tightening on the site of the fracture should be stronger, and the further away the fracture is, the less the tightening should be.	But should you fear any such change then use splints. The way to use these is to place over the fracture itself a splint that is broader and stronger than the rest; and leave a space of a finger's breadth between splints; the splint should be of a length to suit the fracture with the addition of three fingers' breadth all round. Then bandage over the splints in the manner mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. That is, you should bandage more tightly over the fracture itself and more lightly as you get away from the fracture.	0.87549406
If you see fit to place the splints and the tightening as we said while you are setting the limb from your hour, then do so.	If you decide to put on splints and bandage, as we have said, at the time you set the limb, do so.	0.7869499
And if you fear the hot swelling, then leave the tightening and the splints until the seventh day, as we said, then check the bandage every three days so that no itching or swelling occurs in the place, or that food is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening, so fix all of that as we mentioned.	But if you fear an abscess, leave the splinting and bandaging until the seventh day as we have said. Then examine the bandaging every third day lest there be itching or swelling at the place; or nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb on account of excessively tight bandaging; treat all these in the proper manner according to our prescriptions.	0.88469887
If you are confident that nothing of that will happen, then do not loosen the bandage except after many days.	But if you are confident that nothing of this sort is happening then do not loosen the bandaging until after many days.	0.8896179
And the patient should lie on his back with his hand on his stomach, and a moderate elbow pad filled with wool is placed under the upper arm.	The patient should be made to sleep on his back with his hand on his stomach, and under the humerus there should be placed a cushion evenly filled with wool.	0.81429136
And check at all times, night or day, so that the shape of the broken limb does not become distorted or the bandage loosens, so fix all of that with your effort.	And examine it at all times of the day and night lest the shape of the broken limb suffer any deformity or the binding loosen; do your utmost to put any such thing right.	0.8456198
And make the patient's food of the order that we presented, that the food be light at first until the bone starts to strengthen, then you should thicken his food.	You should also direct the patient's diet along the line that we have given earlier; namely, at first the food should be light until the bone has begun to knit; then you should order heavier food.	0.8248317
It is customary for the upper arm and leg to strengthen in forty days, so then it should be loosened and the bath should be used and treated with ointments that are suitable for that.	Now it is the nature of the humerus and of the leg to knit in forty days; then they should be loosened and the patient should go to the bath and be treated with suitable ointments.	0.77922964
If the fracture is severe and crushed, do not loosen the bandage from it until fifty days or two months.	If the fracture be ugly and contused, do not unfasten it for fifty days or even two months.	0.93261933
