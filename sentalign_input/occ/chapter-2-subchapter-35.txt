Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula under the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess resembling a small nut occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from performing its natural functions; and very quickly it grows large until it fills the mouth.
And the procedure for it is that you open the patientâ€™s mouth seated facing the sun and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark or black, hard, and the patient does not feel it, then do not touch it because it is cancerous.
And if it is leaning towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then you place the hook in it, and cut it with a thin blade, and cut it in all parts; and if blood comes to you during the operation, then you place powdered vitriol on it until the bleeding is stopped.
And then return to your work until you have completed it, until it is washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
