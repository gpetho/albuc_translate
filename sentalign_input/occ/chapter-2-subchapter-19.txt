On the reduction of arizati to the nose.
When you treat arizati with cauterization or sharp, burning medicine according to the previous narration and it is not healed, then there is no method except to cut over the ulcer towards its maturity, and extract all the moisture in it and the pus until the bone is exposed.
Then when the bone is exposed and you see in it corruption or blackness, you scrape it with an instrument which has this form:
And it is called an aspre cap, made of Indian iron, with a round head like a rasp made pointed by the puncturing of a file or finely sharpened (as in the following form).
Place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped off.
Do this several times, then restore the place with drying and astringent substances.
Then if the place is consolidated and good flesh has grown there and the core of the ulcer is removed and it remains for 40 days, and it is not renewed and does not ulcerate and no accident occurs in it, then you know it is healed.
If not, then there is no method except to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and in this manner: you expose the bone with iron or sharp medicine, and when the bone is exposed, then take a rasp in this form:
Let the tip of the iron be triangular, and its shaft be thin and extend to the tip as sometimes like this.
Then place it on the bone, near the lacrimal; extend your hand a little from the eye, then rotate your hand with the rasp until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels air coming out when you touch his hand.
Then restore the place with drying astringent medicines as instructed.
Then when the flesh grows and the place is hardened, the matter which was flowing outside returns to the nose, making it lighter for the patient.
