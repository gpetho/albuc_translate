Arrows/Arrowheads are diverse, according to their appearance and according to the places of the body where they fall/land.	Arrows vary both as to types and as to the different parts of the body pierced by them.	0.6813783
Their diversity is such that there are some that have large points, and small ones, and are bladed, and barbed; and some that have two barbs, and some that have tongues, and some that are in pieces; and one which falls into a limb can fall in two ways: either in a principal member's head, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members.	They differ thus as to type: some are big and some are small; some with hollow heads and some with solid; some of them have three angles and some four; some have tongues; some have spikes.	0.7163931
When it falls then in any place in these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you about later, appear to you: then you must abstain from extracting this arrow, because death follows in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deep, then draw it out, and treat the wound. And the signs of the brain, when the arrow lodges there and pierces the bone, and the membrane which is over the brain spurts out, are dizziness and fainting and turning green and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood comes out of the nostrils, or the ears; and perhaps loss of speech and voice; and a white moisture resembling pus comes out of the wound, and also something like burnt flesh; and if these signs appear to you, abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not embedded.	The difference due to the part transfixed by the arrow is twofold: for there are either the chief hollow organs such as the brain, the heart, the liver, the lungs, the kidneys, intestine, bladder, and so forthâ€”when one of these arrows transfixes an organ of this kind, and you observe the signs of death which I shall describe to you later, then you must avoid the extraction of the arrow in that case, for death will generally follow; but when you do not see these fatal signs and the arrow is not quite buried in the depths of the organ, then extract it and dress the wound. Now the signs when the arrow has struck the brain, and penetrated the bone and injured the meninges covering the brain, are these: there arise from that a violent headache and vertigo and giddiness and a redness in the eye, and a redness of the tongue, and convulsion and mental confusion and bilious vomit; perhaps also blood comes out of the nose or from the ears; often also the speech is affected and the voice is lost; also there comes out of the site of the wound a white fluid which resembles gruel, from which there flows something like the juice of meat. If you observe these signs, avoid treating the patient and extraction of the arrow if it has not come out.	0.9116316
The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are that it is near the left nipple, and feels as if it were stuck in something hard, not hollow; and perhaps the arrow moves like the pulse, and black blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat come, and fainting: know then without doubt that death is imminent.	The signs of an arrow in the heart are: nearness to the left breast; the patient feels it as if it were fixed in something solid, not hollow; often also there will be imparted to the arrow a pulsating movement; and black blood will issue from the wound; and after this follow coldness of the extremities and a cold sweat and unconsciousness; then you may know that death is surely on its way.	0.91251576
And the sign of the arrow that pierces the lung is that blood full of froth comes out of the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs deeply and seeks cold air.	The sign of an arrow that has wounded the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound; also the vessels that lie along the neck swell up and the patient changes colour, breathes heavily, and seeks to inhale fresh air very strongly.	0.8616978
And if the arrow falls into the covering of the chest, it is near the small ribs; and causes great difficulty breathing and great pain and sighing; and all the limbs from the shoulders down twitch.	But if the arrow strike the pleura then it will be close to the small ribs and he will breathe deeply with much pain and heaving of the chest, and all parts of his shoulders will be agitated. If the arrow hits the liver, there ensues violent pain, and blood flows from the wound, resembling the liver in its redness.	0.8164793
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, perhaps some undigested food comes out of the wound.	If the arrow strikes the stomach, often undigested food comes out of the wound and renders the case obvious.	0.6920674
And if the arrow falls into the belly, and feces come out of the wound through a ruptured intestine, there is no hope in treatment, nor in extracting the arrow.	If the arrow wounds the belly and is fixed in it, and from the wound there comes excrement or omentum or torn bowel, there is no hope in treatment nor in extracting the arrow.	0.80959916
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out of it abnormally, and the patient feels intense pain: know that the wound is mortal.	If the arrow has hit the urinary bladder, and urine comes out and some of the bladder protrudes and the patient has violent pain, then you may know that the wound is mortal.	0.6933278
The other limbs, such as the face and the neck and the throat and the shoulder and the armpit and the spine of the back and the forearm and the thigh and the legs, and similar limbs, are safe according to various factors. When the arrow is in the nerve or the artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do likewise.	But as for the other parts, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, dorsal vertebrae, collar-bone, hip, leg, and the like, in most cases they will heal if the arrow does not happen to strike an artery or nerve, and if the arrow is not poisoned. Now I will relate to you certain cases of arrow wounds that I have seen, so that you may be guided thereby to your own methods of treatment.	0.77563226
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of the nose: I probed it, and pulled it out the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.	For example, once an arrow struck a man at the corner of his eye near the root of the nose, and I extracted it from him on the other side beneath the lobe of his ear, and he got well, and his eye was none the worse.	0.7567887
And I pulled an arrow from a young man that had struck him in the fat of the eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow was embedded, and I could only reach the tip towards the shaft, and the arrow was from a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs; the young man was healed, and no ill effects came to him.	Also I extracted from a Jew another arrow that had pierced the orbit beneath the lower eyelid; the arrow had sunk out of sight and I could take hold only of the tiny extremity of it which is secured to the shaft; but it was a big arrow from a compound bow, the iron tip four-sided, very smooth without barbs. The Jew recovered, nor did any ill befall his eye.	0.8254896
And I pulled an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabian with barbs: I flattened the barbs, and worked carefully until I pulled it out, and the Christian was healed.	I also extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian. It was an Arab arrow, one of those with two barbs; and I cut down upon it between the two jugulars (for it lay deep in the throat), and worked gently at it until I extracted it; and the Christian was saved and recovered.	0.78328514
And I pulled an arrow from a man, that had fallen into his belly, and I thought he would die; and after thirty days had passed, his condition did not change; I cut down to the arrow, and manipulated it, and pulled it out, and he had no ill effects.	I also extracted another arrow from a man, that had struck him in the abdomen, and our opinion was that he would certainly die from it. But when it had remained in him for the space of thirty days or thereabouts, and his condition was unimpaired, I cut down upon the arrow and manoeuvred it out and extracted it; and he recovered, nor did any harm befall him.	0.8655946
And I also saw a man who had an arrow fall into his back, and the wound closed over it; and the arrow remained inside him, and his natural disposition did not change, nor did he find any harm in any of his natural functions.	And I saw a woman who had been struck in the abdomen by an arrow and the wound healed with the arrow remaining in it, and her condition was unimpaired; she felt no harm from it and her natural functions were not harmed.	0.82587385
And I saw another man, who had an arrow fall into his thigh, and the wound closed; and it remained thus without causing great pain; and many other similar cases.	And I saw a man who had been struck by an arrow in the face, and it had healed over, and he did not feel much pain from it. And many such have I seen.	0.795807
And I pulled an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen in the middle of his nose, and was slightly inclined to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded. I was called to treat it three days after it had fallen. I found the wound very narrow.	I once drew out an arrow from one of the officers of the State, that had struck him in the middle of the nose and was inclining a little to the right, and the whole arrow was buried. I was called to treat him three days after he had received the arrow wound; and I found the arrow wound very narrow.	0.877867
I probed it with a very fine tent, and did not feel it; yet he felt a pricking and pain under his right ear.	I explored it with a fine probe but did not find it; but the patient felt a pricking and a pain beneath the right ear, and I hoped that the pricking was due to the arrow.	0.77635056
I thought it was from the point of the arrow. I applied an attractive and digestive plaster to the area, so that the place would not swell; and the location of the arrow appeared to me.	So I applied a poultice to the spot, a poultice with power to draw out and cause suppuration, desiring that the place should swell and that a sign to indicate the arrow should appear so that I could cut down upon it.	0.7006708
I applied the plaster for many days, and the wound healed over again, and the patient remained like that for a long time, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose; and he told me.	Then one day he felt the arrow inside his nose, and he told me of this; so for a number of days I applied a caustic medicine to the wound until it opened.	0.78666
And physicians believe that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I then restored it, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely cured.	The medical men judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound healed up and the patient made a complete recovery nor did he suffer any harm.	0.76859426
Now I have told you the nature of extracting some arrows, so that you may apply your care to what I have not said, for the book cannot encompass everything; but the wise master understands a great deal from very little, and from what is present and lacking, finds new work, and a new instrument, for the removal of the strange things that occur in this art.	Now I shall tell you the method of extracting certain arrows so that you may take it as a guide and an analogy for others that I have not mentioned; since all parts and details of this art cannot be comprehended in any description, nor can any book include them. A skilful worker will form a judgement on much, from little; and on what is not present from what is before him; and he will think out a new method and a new instrument for an unaccustomed case when it occurs in the practice of this art.	0.8060734
I say that arrows do not come out of the limbs where they are embedded except in two ways: either through the place where they entered, or through another part; and the one that comes out through where it entered, that is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes comes out immediately.	So I would state that arrows come out from the parts of the body they have transfixed, in two ways: either by drawing out from the site of entry; or from the opposite side. An arrow that comes out by the track of its entry: the arrow may be visible, standing out from a fleshy part, in which case it may be extracted by pulling.	0.81955487
And if it does not come out immediately, leave it until the flesh around it is rotted, and the exit is widened; and also if it is embedded in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it like that for some days, and move it every day; and then it will come out, and if it does not come out, then pierce around it with a very fine drill, until the place around it is widened, and then pull it out.	Similarly if it has stuck fast in a bone and will not come out, leave this also for a few days, repeatedly pulling on it and shifting it day by day, and then it will come out. But if it will not come out after some days, you will have to drill away the bone from all round with a fine drill so as to make room for the arrow; then draw on it and pull it out.	0.8339263
And if the arrow is embedded in the bone of the head, and goes as far as one of the ventricles of the brain, and any of the accidents that I have mentioned appear in the patient: do not pull it out, but leave it until it is even after some days, because if the arrow reaches as far as the meninges, it is death.	If the arrow is buried in some part of the body and is quite lost to sight, explore for it with a probe, and if you can feel it then draw it out with any suitable instrument.	0.40964592
And if the arrow is only embedded in the bone, and does not reach the meninges, and the patient remains for some days without ill effects, then devise a way to pull it out.	But if you cannot get at it on account of the narrowness of the wound and the depth at which the arrow is, and there be no bone nor nerve nor blood-vessel, then cut round it until the wound be sufficiently wide to enable you to take hold of it and extract it.	0.4340448
And if it is embedded very deeply and cannot come out otherwise, then apply drills around it, as I have told you; then treat the place until it is healed. And if the arrow is lodged in a place in the body where it cannot be seen, then search for it with the probe; and if you feel it, pull it out with a suitable instrument; and if you cannot because of the narrowness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone or nerve or vein there, then enlarge the wound until it is large; and pull out the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs which hold it in place, then remove the flesh that is embedded in them from both sides as best you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, so that you can pull it out; and be very careful not to break the arrow, as you would have more difficulty pulling it out.	And if it have two barbs by which it is held, free them from the adherent flesh all round, in any way you can; or, if you cannot free the tissues, try skilfully to break off the two barbs and twist them about until the arrow comes free. Whenever you try to extract an arrow from any part, employ a twisting motion of your hand with the forceps in all directions until you free it; and use the utmost gentleness not to break the arrow and thus make it hard to draw it out and remove it.	0.7605615
And if you cannot do it at once, leave it until the surrounding area is putrefied, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier.	If you are unable to get it out at once then leave it for some days until the tissues that surround it putrefy, then return to it, for then the extraction will be easy; and if haemorrhage interfere use the remedies prescribed in the chapter dealing with that.	0.64926773
And if the flow of blood hinders you, then apply what we have said about the treatment in its chapter; and beware of cutting a nerve or vein, and devise how you can best pull out the arrow without danger, either quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently; and position the patient according to the position he was in when the arrow struck him, for this is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then position him according to what the symptoms indicate.	Exercise the utmost care not to cut a blood-vessel or nerve or tendon; and employ the greatest skill in freeing the arrow; it should be done gently and unhurriedly and with perseverance, as I have told you. When extracting an arrow you should place the patient in the same position he was in when the arrow struck him, for that is more convenient; but if you cannot do this then let him be in whatever position is possible for you.	0.8342222
The arrow that emerges from the other side, where some part of it appears, or the skin is swollen around it so that it can be seen or felt clearly: then cut over it, so that the forceps can grip it, and then pull it out: it should come out immediately.	The arrow that is to be extracted from the opposite side either has some part protruding through or else the tip of the arrow gives rise to a palpable swelling just beneath the skin and you see it sticking out; then cut down upon it; the incision should be wide enough to admit the forceps. Then pull on it, for the extraction of it will be easy.	0.77791905
And if it is stuck in the bone, then rotate your hand circularly, until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then pull it out.	If it is stuck in bone, twist it round with your hand until the arrow makes an impression in the bone and opens up a way for itself; then pull it.	0.7797505
And if it cannot come out, then leave it again, and then resume the extraction until it comes out; and if the shaft of the arrow is there, push it in with the whole shaft; and if the shaft falls off, and you wish to apply pressure, then apply a hollow instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the hollow of the instrument; and then push it out, and if the arrow is barbed, apply an instrument with an inward-pointing tip, to facilitate the extraction.	If it does not come out, let it alone for some days, and repeat until it does come out. If the arrow-shaft be in the wound, then thrust the arrow out with that. But if the shaft has fallen out, and you wish to employ thrusting, introduce down to it the hollow instrument whose cavity will enter upon the ferrule of the arrow, then push it forward with that. If the arrow be hollow, thrust it forward with an instrument that will enter into the cavity, for the exit of the arrow will thereby be made easy.	0.8241965
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must cut away all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as appropriate.	If the arrow be poisoned you must, if you can, cut out in a circle all the flesh into which the poison has entered; then treat it with what is appropriate.	0.86767495
And if the arrow falls in the chest or the abdomen or the bladder or the side, and it is close, and you can cut over it, then cut; and be careful not to cut the vein or the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.	If the arrow that has struck be in the chest or abdomen or in the urinary bladder or in the flank and it be close enough for you to explore it with the probe and you can cut down upon it, then do so, but beware of cutting into a blood-vessel or nerve. Then remove the arrow. Afterwards suture the wound, if suture be necessary, and dress it until it heals.	0.8525401
The shape of the forceps with which one extracts arrows is similar to a bird's beak, and see here the shape:	Forceps for extracting arrows. The extremities resemble the bill of a bird and are engraved like a file so as not to lose grip when you close them upon an arrow or some other object.	0.5335366
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.	They are made in several kinds, large, small, or medium, all according to the bigness or smallness of the arrow and the breadth or narrowness of the wound.	0.6749532
The shape of the pushing instrument is also like a bird's feather, to push against the tip of the arrow, as here is the shape:	The extremity is solid like a probe, to facilitate entry into, and pushing, the hollow arrow.	0.47116712
