Chapter Six on the reduction of shoulder fractures.
The shoulder blade rarely breaks in its wide part.
Rather, it breaks at its edges.
Whenever a place in it breaks, or it breaks in its middle, which is known by touch, depending on the shape of the fracture, you must straighten it and return it to its natural shape by any means possible.
Then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft mashaqa (a type of plaster).
And place on top a pad of folded cloth.
Then place on it a wide splint of thin wood, the size of the entire shoulder or slightly wider.
If there is a curvature under the splint in any place of the shoulder, correct that curvature with soft mashaqa until the splint sits evenly.
Then tighten it from above with a long turban, tightly and firmly, and secure the splint so that it does not move from its place.
Check the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved from its place.
The patient should lie on his healthy side.
The shoulder heals in twenty or twenty-five days.
When this period is complete, untie the bandage and you will be safe, for it is among the bones that are not feared to shatter or deteriorate.
If a splinter of bone protrudes and it pricks under the skin, incise it and extract it, and do what I mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle about soothing the hot swelling if any of that occurs.
