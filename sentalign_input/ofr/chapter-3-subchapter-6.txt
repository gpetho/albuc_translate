of the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks except in a wide place or in the middle, and one does not know it except by touch;
so prepare it according to the form of the break, and restore it according to its natural form, in every way that you can;
then put on the area mill dust with plenty of egg, and light stuffing, and put on a double cloth;
then put on a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the splint there are hollows in any place on the shoulder, fill that hollow with linen stuffing, so that the splint sits evenly;
and then bind it all firmly with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day;
and every time it loosens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it is out of place, and have the patient lie on their side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five.
And when this time is complete, unbind it, and be certain, for it is not a bone that dislocates easily.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes forward, and points below the heart, then cut over it, and remove it, and do what we have said regarding the breaking of the clavicle to soothe a hot abscess.
