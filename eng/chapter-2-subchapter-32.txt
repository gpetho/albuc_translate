 CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO.
On the sawing-down of teeth growing on top of others.
 When teeth grow in other than their natural place the appearance is very bad, specially when it occurs in women or slaves.
So you should examine; if the tooth has grown out behind another tooth and it is impossible either to saw or file it down, then extract it.
But if it be attached to another tooth, cut it down with an instrument of this kind.
It resembles a small chisel and should be of Indian steel with a well-sharpened end.
You should spread your cutting with it over several days on account of the hardness of the tooth and so as to leave the others undisturbed.
If the tooth projects in such a way as to make filing possible, use a file of Indian iron, shaped like this.
It should be wholly manufactured of Indian iron, its handle too, and covered with very fine points to resemble the file used in making needles.
You should file the tooth with it very slowly and gently over a period of many days so as not to shift the tooth and cause it to fall out; then finally smooth it and scrape it with one of the scrapers.
If it be a tooth of which part has broken off and it hurts the tongue in speaking, file it down till you have disposed of the roughness of the break and the tooth is smooth and neither injures the tongue nor hinders speech.
