A sharnaq is a small lump that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it occurs most often in children, making their eyes heavy and causing them to experience colds in the early mornings.	Hydatid is fat which arises in the folds of the upper lid. It is a disease chiefly occurring in children, irritating their eyes, giving them morning catarrh; they are unable to look full into the light of the sun, since they get an immediate secretion of tears.	0.62782913
They are unable to look at sunlight because tears quickly come to their eyes, and so you see them constantly leaning on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist, swollen, and the protrusion of the sharnaq is visible. And when you press the area with your fingers, you will feel the sharnaq between them.	And for that reason you will find them lying always on their faces, and they also sleep on their faces; and the eyelids below the eyebrows are moist and covered with swellings, while the hydatid stands out prominently; and when you press upon the place with your finger you can feel the fat beneath it.	0.6990465
The procedure is to place the patient's head in your lap, then take a linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick to the extent that it surrounds the sharnaq from all sides, then place it on it and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the sharnaq in the center of the circle, then make a horizontal incision in the middle of that moist area with a lancet, and the incision should not be larger than the incision made for bloodletting.	The manner of operating is for the patient to let his head rest in your lap. Then you take a scrap of linen and prepare a pad of it. Make it into a circle of sufficient size to enclose the whole of the hydatid on all sides, then place it on it and squeeze with your fingers on all sides, so as to gather up the hydatid in the centre of the circle. Then in the middle of this humidity make a crosswise incision with a lancet, but do not let the incision be larger than that made for a venesection.	0.87990534
As for the depth, you should incise the entire skin until you reach the sharnaq, and in most cases the sharnaq will protrude from the incision in the form of a white piece of fat, so pull it out with a cloth that you have wrapped between your fingers while turning your hand right and left until it is completely removed.	As to the depth, the skin should be incised right through till you come to the hydatid, which in most cases will come out from the incision, in the shape of a white piece of fat. Draw it out with a cloth rolled between your fingers, turning your hand to right and to left till it is separated.	0.75884765
Beware of increasing the size of the incision, lest the lancet reach the eye and harm it.	Be careful not to go so deep with your scalpel that it sticks in the eye and injures it.	0.68954754
If the sharnaq does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, then you should increase the incision slightly and gently until the sharnaq appears, then pull it out as we mentioned.	If you do not see the hydatid at the first incision, you must gently cut a little deeper till it comes forth, then draw it out as described.	0.67487466
Then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area and bandage it with a soft dressing.	Then dip some cloth in vinegar and water, apply to the place and bind it up with pads.	0.8633038
Some people crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals.	There are some who grind up salt and put it in the hollow of the incision to liquefy thereby the remains of the humidity. Then dress till healed.	0.8722055
If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.	If an effusion occur in the place, treat with sedative plasters till healed.	0.80363137
