Chapter XXX
On the treatment of spinal dislocation.
When a complete dislocation of any spinal vertebra or neck vertebra occurs, and many vertebrae are displaced, there is no cure, as death quickly follows.
A sign of this is involuntary excretion, and inability to retain it; often some limbs become paralyzed, such as both legs, both arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is displaced, which sometimes shifts to four directions.
This displacement to the back is called kyphosis.
But treatment depends on whether kyphosis occurred in childhood, as then there is no cure or complete recovery.
But for kyphosis caused by injury or trauma, the Ancients have described detailed treatment methods, which mostly provide benefit; I have summarized these to avoid excessive detail, while aligning with my intent to explain, forming a diverse set of instruments to demonstrate and apply them.
For kyphosis from the front in the chest, there is no cure; similarly, for one occurring on both sides.
Only kyphosis in the back can be treated with the method I will describe.
The patient should lie face down on a level place near a wall, with a soft pad underneath to avoid chest injury.
A straight post should be placed upright in the ground at the head of the patient’s place, and another at the feet.
One assistant holds the post at the head, without fixing it in a hole, and another holds the one at the feet similarly.
Then wrap a strong band around the patient’s head and under the armpits; extend it to the post at the head and tie it there; similarly, tie another band around the hips and thighs, and secure it to the post at the feet.
Each assistant then tightens the bands towards the posts; the posts and bands remain in place, not firmly fixed as described.
The doctor then presses the vertebra with his palms firmly until it returns, or places a board over it and applies pressure with his feet until it returns.
If it does not return this way, use a board about three cubits wide or long, and make a hole in the wall near the patient where the end of the board fits.
Then place half of the board over the vertebra, and the doctor applies pressure with his feet on the other end, tightening it until the vertebra returns to its place.
If preferred, use a turning device operated by hand; place two posts, each a cubit long, in the ground near the patient's head and another two at the feet, with a space of one palm's width between each; make holes in each post for a rotating rod, firmly fixed in the ground.
Insert a round rod for the rotating device through the holes in the two posts.
At the end of the rod, there is a hole to fit a handle one palm long for turning; the other two posts have similar holes.
Tighten the bands from the patient's chest into the holes near the head, and the bands from the thighs into the turning device near the feet.
Each assistant turns the device by hand while the doctor adjusts the vertebra as described.
This is the form of the turning device:
Once the vertebra is returned and the position corrected, apply a drying poultice with egg white, then wool; place over the poultice a splint from a board three fingers wide or so, long enough to cover the kyphosis area, and over the healthy part of the spine.
Bandage it as described, and let the patient use light nourishment until healed.
If any prominence remains at the end of healing, administer softening medicines and use the board treatment for a long time as recommended; sometimes a lead sheet is applied.
Sometimes a prominence appears behind the spinal vertebrae, mistaken for dislocation; this bone prominence should not be treated with this method, as it can quickly lead to death.
