The author of this book says: When I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is a part of medical science in its completeness, and have reached the utmost clarity and explanation in it, I saw fit to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the practical work.
Because practical work is completely lacking in our country and in our time, so much so that its knowledge is almost extinct and its effect has ceased. And there remain only a few traces of it in the books of the ancients, which have been copied by hands and marred by error and confusion, until its meanings have become obscure and its benefit has been lost.
Therefore I saw fit to revive it and compose this treatise on it in a way that is explanatory, clear, and concise, and to include pictures of cauterizing irons and other surgical instruments, since this adds to the explanation and provides what is needed.
The reason why there is no skilled craftsman in our time is that the craft of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must first practice in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen. until he understands the functions, forms, temperaments, connections, and separations of the organs, and knows the bones, nerves, muscles, their number, and their origins, the arteries and veins, and the places of their origins.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the craft of surgery, and we have mentioned some of this in the introduction to this book.
For he who is not knowledgeable in what we have mentioned concerning anatomy will inevitably fall into error and kill people thereby, as I have often seen in those who imagined themselves knowledgeable in this science and claimed it without knowledge or expertise.
For I saw an ignorant physician who incised a porcine tumor in a woman's neck, and severed some of the neck's arteries, so the woman bled until she fell dead before him.
And I saw another physician who proceeded to remove a stone from a man who had been wounded in the bladder; the stone was large, and he acted rashly, removing it with a piece of the bladder tissue. And the man died after about three days, and I had been called to remove it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that I could have done it.
And I saw another physician who earned his living practicing medicine with some of the brothel keepers of our city.
Then a black boy came to him with a fracture in his leg near the heel, together with a wound.  The physician, in his ignorance, hastily bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and splints very tightly, and left no room for the wound to breathe.
Then he gave way to his desires, and left him for several days, and ordered him not to untie the bandage until his leg and foot swelled and he was near death.
Then I was called to him, and I hastened to untie the bandage; then he found relief and was freed from his pains, except that the corruption had become established in the limb and I could not prevent it.
Then the corruption continued to spread in the limb until he died.
And I saw another physician cauterize a cancerous tumor, which ulcerated after several days until the suffering of its owner became severe.  This is because if a cancer is purely of a black humor, then it should not be touched with iron at all.
Unless it is in a limb that can be entirely excised.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two parts: work accompanied by safety, and work accompanied by harm in most cases.
And I have warned, in every place that it comes in this book, against work which involves risk and danger, and you should avoid and reject it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to criticize and attack, take for yourselves caution and circumspection, and for your patients gentleness and deliberation.
And use the best method leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to cure.
And keep yourselves clear from what you fear might cast doubt on your religion and your worldly affairs; for that is more lasting for your reputation and higher for your standing in this world and the next.
For Galen said in some of his precepts: Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be called bad physicians.
This chapter is divided into three sections.
The first section.
Concerning cautery with fire and cautery with a strong medicine, arranged systematically from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments and cautery irons and everything needed for the work by hand.
And the second section.
Concerning incision, puncture, bloodletting, cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and the like, all arranged systematically, with illustrations of the instruments.
And the third section.
Concerning setting [bones], reduction of dislocations, treatment of fractures and the like, arranged systematically from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments.
The first section.
Concerning cauterization.
And before we mention its use, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
So I say that the discussion of the benefit and harm of cauterization is lengthy discourse, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and a number of wise men have spoken about it.
And they differed in it, and I have shortened their words for fear of lengthening.
So I say that cauterization generally benefits every bad temperament that is with a material thing and without a material thing, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without material and the dry temperament without material.
As for the dry temperament with material, they differed in it. Some said that cauterization is beneficial in it, and others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible to cure a hot dry disease with a hot dry medicine. And he who says the opposite says that cauterization with fire may benefit from a hot dry disease that occurs in the bodies of people. Because when you add the body of man and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the body of man cold.
And I say what he says, because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that one should not imagine that matter except one who has practiced and trained in the matter of cauterization a thorough training. And he has observed the difference in the temperaments of people and the state of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and their duration.
But as for the other temperaments, there is no fear from them, especially cold and moist diseases, for all physicians have agreed upon them and have not differed in the benefit of cauterization in them.
And know, O my sons, that among the secrets of cauterization and its superiority over cauterization with a burning medicine is that fire is a simple element whose action does not exceed the member that is cauterized, nor does it harm another member connected to it except a little harm.
And cauterization with a burning medicine may exceed its effect to what is beyond the members, and perhaps it causes in the member a disease difficult to treat, and perhaps it kills, and fire, for its nobility and the nobility of its essence, does not do that except if one exaggerates.
And this has become clear to us through experience, long service, attention to the craft, and understanding of the realities of the matter.
For this reason I have dispensed with lengthy speech, and were it not that it is not befitting my book, I would have presented to you concerning fire a hidden secret and the manner of its action in bodies and its expulsion of diseases with philosophical, demonstrative speech too subtle for your understanding.
And know, O my sons, that they have differed concerning the time suitable for cauterization, and they have considered the best time to be springtime.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at every time, because the harm occurring from the time is consumed by the benefit which is brought about by cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for strong, necessary, urgent pains which do not tolerate delay, for what is feared from them is that they may be followed by a calamity which is greater than the slight harm resulting from the time.
And let it not occur to you, O my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization which cures a certain disease will never recur, and that you should make it a preventative.
And the matter is not as they suppose, because cauterization is only in the position of a medicine which changes the temperament and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
Except that cauterization is preferable to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.
And it is possible that the disease may return after a time, according to the temperament of the patient, the strength of his disease, and what is prepared in his body from the gathering of humors in it, and his negligence in acquiring them from foods and similar causes.
Except that the disease in which cauterization is used is a mild disease and in a member with few humors and moistures. Like cauterizing a tooth for pain and the like; it is possible that that pain may not return, and that is in the least.
And as for the common people's saying also that cauterization is the last of medicine, it is a true saying, not to what they go to, for they believe that no treatment is beneficial with medicine or otherwise after cauterization has occurred, and the matter is otherwise.
And the meaning of cauterization being the last of medicine is only that when we have used types of treatment in a disease and those medicines have not been effective, then we use cauterization as the last thing, and it is effective. From here it is said that cauterization is the last of medicine. Not in the sense to which the common people and many ignorant physicians have gone.
The ancients mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said that because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence, and they said that the place of cauterization does not suppurate.  This is not always the case.
Because I have tried that and found that it only does that in some bodies and not others, and cauterization with it is better and more preferable than with iron, as they said, except that if you heat the cautery iron in the fire [made of] gold, you cannot determine when it is heated to the degree you want because of the redness of the gold.
And because it quickly becomes cold, and if you increase the heat, it melts in the fire and is poured out, causing the craftsman trouble. Therefore, cauterization with iron is, for us, quicker and closer to correctness in practice, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections that I have organized from head to foot, to make it easier for the student to find what he wants, God willing.
The first chapter.
Cauterization of the head, one cauterization.
This cauterization benefits from the excess of moisture and cold in the brain, which are the cause of headache, frequent colds from the head to the region of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, and toothaches and throat pains. And in general, for every disease that arises from cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and aphasia, and similar diseases.
The method of this cauterization is that you first order the patient to vomit with a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habit of the patient.
Then you order him to shave his head with a razor, then you seat him before you cross-legged, having placed his hands on his chest.
Then you place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes; where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, which is of this form.
Let the bone be uncovered to the extent of the head of a clove or the size of a carob seed; then raise your hand, otherwise replace your hand with the same or another iron if it has cooled. Until you see of the bone what I have mentioned to you; then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak a cotton swab in it, apply it to the area, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton swab soaked in butter to it and leave it there until the scab from the cautery is gone; then treat it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals, God willing.
And they have said that the wound, the longer it remains open, the more pus it discharges, and that is better and more beneficial.
And some have mentioned cauterizing the skin to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the thickness of the bone is burned, then removing what has been burned from the bone afterwards, and then treating it.
And others said that one should exaggerate with the cautery until it strongly affects the bone, until it falls from the bone in the form of a carat or a small disc, and they claimed that this vents the vapors of the head from that area, leaving the wound open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals.  I do not see these two types of cautery at all except in some people and in a haphazard way; in my opinion, leaving it alone is better and safer.  If there is healing, for the head weakens whenever its natural connection is disrupted, as we have seen in other organs.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it; act accordingly and you will be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
Also on cauterizing the head.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head and persists in the patient, and applications, gargles, snuffs, ointments, and dressings have been used, especially if a single cauterization, as we have described, has been performed without benefit, then look. If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, cauterize him again a little above the previous cauterization. Then cauterize each horn of his head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone we described is exposed. And cauterize him at the back of his head in the place known as the axe, and lighten your hand in this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will find this very painful, unlike the pain of all other head cauterizations. I will mention this cauterization in its place.
The cautery used for the horns of the head and the back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used for the middle of the head.  This is its image.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in a fissure of the head, accompanied by headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then purge the patient with head-purifying medicines and use all the treatments I mentioned in the divisions of diseases. If this does not work, then cauterization is done in two ways. Either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine or with iron.
As for cauterization with a burning medicine, take a single clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends on both sides. Then, incise the place of pain in the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a space under the skin large enough for the clove.
Then insert it under the skin until it disappears, then tie it tightly with bandages, and leave it for about fifteen hours. Then untie it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then dress it.
Apply cotton soaked in butter until the area suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.  If you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medicines which I mentioned in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
As for cauterization with iron, it is in this manner: heat the cautery iron, which is pictured thus:
It is called the nail cautery because its head is like the head of a nail, somewhat perforated, and with a small projection in the middle.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you rotate the iron little by little, and the amount you burn should be about half the thickness of the skin. Lift your hand so as not to burn the artery underneath and cause bleeding, then soak cotton in salt water and apply it to the area and leave it for three days. Then dress the cotton with butter, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the knife-like end of the cautery, and this preserves you from cutting the artery in this chronic migraine in particular.
Chapter Four.
Incision of chronic migraine.
If you treat the migraine with what we have mentioned of the aforementioned treatment and what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not work, and you see from the illness what is not remedied by what we mentioned of the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire. Then you should heat the knife-like cautery until it whitens, after you have marked the painful area with a line half a fingerbreadth long or so, and you should let go your hand once, while you are pulling it, until you sever the artery and reach toward the bone.
But you should be cautious about touching the jaw which moves when chewing, lest you burn the muscle or the nerve which moves it, and thus cause spasms.
And be cautious and watchful of bleeding from the artery which you cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially for one who is ignorant of what he does and is not a practiced expert; and abandoning the work is preferable.
And the treatment of bleeding that occurs from the artery will be mentioned in its place in the book, God willing; if you see from the condition something which this cauterization does not remedy.
And you saw the patient's body able to tolerate it, cauterize in the middle of the head as we described and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cauterization which we mentioned in the chapter on the incision of the artery with the double-bladed cautery; for it is a better and more effective cauterization than this.
Chapter Five.
On cauterizing the pains of the ears.
If a pain occurs in the ear due to cold, and it is treated with purgatives and all the treatments we mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery called the point, which is of this shape.
Then, after heating it, prick with it around the whole ear, as it goes around, or around both if the pain is in both. And keep the cauterization a little away from the root of the ear, after marking the place with ink. The cauterization should be about ten points in each ear or thereabouts.  Then treat the places until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six.
On cauterizing the abscess.
The abscess which is treated by cauterization is of the type which arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classification of diseases.
And one should avoid cauterizing the type which arises from dryness and nerve tension.
When you have treated this type of abscess with poultices, snuffs, and gargles and your treatment has been ineffective, then it is necessary that the patient be cauterized with three cauterizations. One at the root of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
And make your cauterization on the opposite side from the diseased side, for relaxation occurs on the side which appears healthy.
The form of the cauterization is that you cauterize with a cauterization opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple, and its length should be the length of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cautery; it is a type of scalpel, the image of which has preceded, but it is a little gentler than it, as you see. The scalpel should be a little thicker than usual. Then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
Cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
If the apoplexy becomes chronic and you treat it with what we have mentioned and your treatment is not effective and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize him in four places. One cauterization on each temple, one in the middle of the head as we mentioned, and one at the back of the head as previously described.
The prescription for the cautery is as previously mentioned.  It may also be cauterized on the stomach, which will be more effective, then treat as before.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterizing forgetfulness.
If it is from phlegm, the patient should first be given strong purgatives and brain-cleansing pills.
Then his whole head is shaved and a mustard plaster, as described in the chapter on plasters, is applied to the back of his head repeatedly, for this is a kind of cautery.
Do this in the very order I mentioned there; if he is cured by this, well and good; otherwise, perform three cauterizations on the back of his head, arranged in a row from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
Make the space between each cauterization the width of a finger. Then treat the cauterization as described above. If you wish to increase [the number of cauterizations] and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle.
If you wish to increase [the number of cauterizations], cauterize on the temples, then treat it until it heals. The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterizing paralysis and general bodily relaxation.
It is necessary that you first proceed to purify the head with purgatives and what we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head, then cauterize: one cauterization in the middle of the head, one on each temple, and one on the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck. If, in a case of bodily relaxation, you need more than that, and the patient can tolerate it and the illness is strong and persistent, then cauterize with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of his back. And continue the cauterization until you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand, and then treat him as previously mentioned until he heals, God willing.  The cautery should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
Cauterization for Epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm should be cauterized.  His brain should first be purged with strong purgatives and with all the other treatments we mentioned in the classification, if the patient is an adult and can tolerate taking medicines.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then use gargles and masticatories that cleanse the brain many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then shave his head and cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, as previously described, and another cautery at the back of his head. And one cautery on each temple. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize him with the cauteries mentioned for the treatment of paralysis and body relaxation, on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back; the cautery irons should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery iron gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauteries we mentioned for the paralytic.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined toward black bile and the patient's body is moist, purge him with what cleanses the brain, as previously described in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tightly woven linen cake in the shape of a circle, then place it in the middle of his head while the seated patient holds it in place from all sides, then take one pound of old sheep tallow.
Then heat it over a fire to a moderate temperature, as much as the finger can bear when inserted, then pour it into the middle of his head inside the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this for the patient once a week, along with his other good treatment, until he is healed, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small punctures, without holding the cautery in your hand but rather by sprinkling it, for this type of cautery moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cotton ball soaked in tallow or chicken fat to it.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing a runny eye.
If you ascertain the beginning of a runny eye with the signs I mentioned in the classification, then act quickly, purge the patient of what cleanses his head and protect him from all humors, and sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize him in the middle of the head, then cauterize him twice on the temples if the onset of the runny eye is in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin, and let the cauterizations be lengthwise across the temples, and guard against bleeding.
If you see any of it, cut it off immediately with whatever treatment is possible for you, and we will come to the wisdom in cauterizing and cutting arteries and guarding against bleeding.
And he may be cauterized in the nape of the neck under the two bones with two strong cauterizations.
Chapter Thirteen.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic weeping sores.
If the weeping sores of the eye are chronic and persistent, and are from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head, from outside the head, and you are certain that it is from cold, thick, phlegmatic superfluities, then cauterize it with the cauterization that I described in the beginning for the descending water. One cauterization in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations on the temples, and two cauterizations in the nape of the neck under the two bones. And if you need more, then cauterize one cauterization on each side of the corner of the eye at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter Fourteen.
Concerning the cauterization of a foul-smelling nose.
If you treat it with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment is not effective, then immediately purge the patient with colocynth for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle with the olive-shaped cautery. Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery two cauterizations above the eyebrows, slightly under the hair, and be careful of the artery, do not cut it. And this is the image of the nail-shaped cautery.
Chapter Fifteen.
Concerning the cauterization of a relaxed eyelid.
If an eyelid relaxes due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid with one cauterization using this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize slightly above the eyebrows, two cauterizations on each side, keeping a distance from the temples, and let the length of each cauterization be the length of the eyebrow.
Do not exaggerate with the cauterization, but only to the extent that a third of the skin is burned, and the shape of the cautery is like this.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its margins are inverted inwards so that the eye is pushed in, then cauterization is of two types. Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a burning medicine. As for cauterization with fire, you should order the patient beforehand to leave his eyelashes alone, if he is one who plucks them, until they grow long and even.
If it is pushed in while they are growing, then tie his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow. When they have grown and become even, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of an upside down ‘āsin’.
The beginning of the mark should be near the margins. Then place under the eyelid a cotton wool pledget soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a lizard. Then heat a cautery iron; this is its shape.
Then cauterize following the marked shape little by little, many times, until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of the upside down ‘āsin’, is completely burnt, especially its surface. A sign that your work is successful is to see the eyelid curled and the eyelashes raised from the conjunctiva of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days. Then apply a cotton pledget with butter to it until the eschar separates.  Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If some hair returns after a while and the eyelid relaxes,
repeat the cauterization in that place as you did before. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and the hair does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with a corrosive medicine, you should instruct the patient to leave the margins until they lengthen and become even.
Then make from paper the shape of an upside-down ‘āsin’. Then take of the usual soap and of unslaked lime, of each one a drachm or thereabouts, and grind them together very finely. Do this quickly lest it dry. Then spread some of it on the paper you made in the shape of the upside-down ‘āsin’ and place it on one or both eyelids. Place a cotton pledget soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on top of the medicine and press it gently, moving it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medicine, for he will feel a burning sensation. As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine in place and move it with your finger. When the burning ceases, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Observe, and if you see the eyelid raised as it is raised by burning or cutting, then it is finished. Otherwise, apply more medicine to the place where the medicine has not taken effect and has not blackened, until you complete your work and the eyelid is raised.  Then apply cotton with butter to it until the scab from the burning is removed.
Then treat it with emollient ointment or another until it heals. When working, you should be extremely careful that none of the medicine falls into the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after a few days and something like hair is suspected in the eye,
reapply the medicine to that part of the eyelid that has relaxed, in the same way as before, then treat it until it heals. This is the shape of the upside-down ‘āsin’.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, so your cauterization should be adjusted accordingly. The correct method is not hidden from one who is experienced in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the polyp that appears in the corner of the eye.
If you treat the polyp with what we mentioned in the classification of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
Order the patient to place his head in your lap, and have a servant hold his head in your hands so that he does not move or shake his head.
Then, place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a frog on his eyes, then heat the cautery iron, which is depicted as follows.
It should be hollow like the quill of an eagle's feather at one end, which is the end used for cauterization; and if you wish, it can be perforated at the other end, or if you wish it can be solid like an awl, but the hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then, squeeze the polyp if it is open and remove its contents and dry it; or if it is not open, open it and remove its pus. Then, at that time, apply the very hot cautery iron to it, holding it with your hand until you reach the bone.
And move your hand slightly away during cauterization from the eye towards the nose, lest your hand slip or the patient move, and the cautery iron fall on the conjunctiva and damage it. If you reach the bone with the first cauterization, well and good; otherwise, reapply the cautery iron a second time if needed.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton soaked in butter and treat it with drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, apply a strong, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and clean it as will be described in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing a polyp, mentioned by some of the ancients:  You should aim at the location of the polyp, incise it, then place a thin cone in the incision itself; this is its image.
Pour into it the weight of a dirham of molten lead, and hold your hand firmly on the cone, and the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead flow into his eye.  It is necessary to place cotton soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
For the lead will burn the polyp and heal it wonderfully. If the polyp heals with the cauterization and treatment mentioned, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to use the perforation of the nose and return the polyp to the nasal passage, as will be described in its appropriate place.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing a cleft lip.
A cleft often occurs in the lip, called a harelip, especially in the lips of children; it frequently occurs. If you treat this cleft with what we have mentioned in the section and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-like cautery of this form.
Its cavity should be as thin as a knife, then apply it hot quickly to the cleft itself until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft, then treat it with the quirotu until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing a fistula occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling appears at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and a fistula results from the flow of pus, and you treat it but the treatment is not effective, then you should heat a cautery to the extent that it fits into the fistula.
Then insert it hot into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its bottom and end. Do this once or twice, then treat it afterwards with what we have mentioned of treatments until it heals, God willing.
If the discharge stops and it heals, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place and remove the decayed bone, according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Concerning the loosening of the molars and gums.
If the gums become loose from moisture and the molars become mobile, and you treat them with medications and they do not work, then place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery iron, the image of which comes after this, after you place the cannula on the tooth.
Then insert the hot cautery iron quickly and hold your hand a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then raise your hand, then repeat the cautery several times as you wish, then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water.
And he holds it for an hour and spits it out; then the mobile tooth will be fixed, and the loose gum will tighten, and the foul moisture will dry.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In cauterizing the toothache.
If the toothache is from cold or there are worms in it and medication has not worked, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fat or cauterization with fire.
As for cauterization with fat, you take cow's fat and boil it in an iron spoon or a shell, then take cotton, wrap it around the end of a probe, then dip it in the boiled fat and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat it several times until the strength of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.  And if you wish, you can dip wool or cotton in cold fat and place it on the aching tooth and put a heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, take a copper or iron tube, and let it be somewhat thick so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then heat the cautery iron, the image of which is shown, and place it on the tooth itself, and hold your hand until the cautery iron cools. Do this repeatedly.
Then the pain will go away, either that same day or another day. After the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good fat and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.  This is the image of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, and according to what is possible. This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-two.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If fistulas are caused by phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to ripening medications, and you desire quick ripening, then heat a hollow cautery iron, the image of which is shown here, which is perforated at both ends.
So that smoke exits from the other end during cauterization, place it carefully on the tumor itself once or twice, if necessary, until you reach the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the cautery iron proportionate to the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply cotton soaked in butter to it until what was burned by the fire is removed.  Then treat it with ointment and tents until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
On cauterization for hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If humors overwhelm the windpipe, especially if this is accompanied by a cold temperament, then the patient should first be purged with purgative medicines. Then cauterize with a cautery iron in the hollow of the neck at the root of the throat in the lower location.
Beware of reaching the throat with the cauterization and do not burn more than half of the skin. Then cauterize another time at the joint of the neck at the end of its last vertebra, forcefully. And let the cautery iron be nail-shaped in the manner previously described.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On cauterization for lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize two times above the clavicles in the low, soft, empty places, and another time in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And let the cautery be nail-shaped, in the manner previously described. And if you wish, let your cauterization be by puncturing with the cautery called the “point,” the image of which has been previously shown in puncturing earache, and let the punctures be from thirty points or thereabouts.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he recovers. You may also make a cautery with three branches in this shape, and hasten the cauterization with it because you cauterize three times in one go with it. This is the image of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated because of slippery humors, or if it does not remain fixed when it is reduced from its dislocation, so that it becomes habitual for it to be reduced and then dislocate at the slightest movement it is subjected to, as we have witnessed, then it is necessary to reduce the joint first. Then the patient lies on his back or on his healthy side, and then the skin inside the armpit is raised upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then you heat the cautery iron with two heads, which is of this form.
Then you cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side, and the form of the cauterization is four cauterizations.  It may be cauterized with a cautery iron with three heads; then the form of the cauterization is six cauterizations. The heads should be thin as a reed.
And this is the image of the cautery iron with three heads.
And this number may be increased by one, so that the cauterizations are eight. Then, pounded balls with salt are applied to the cauterization. Then, the patient is kept quiet and does not move the limb for a time until it strengthens. If the dislocation is upwards, which is rarely the case.
Cauterize above the shoulder with one good, nail-like cauterization, or numerous cauterizations in a dotted pattern; for the joint will be strengthened, the moisture will leave, and the patient will heal.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In cauterizing the stomach.
If coldness and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, deranging its temperament, and if many catarrhal discharges occur in it, and it is treated with various remedies to no avail, then the patient should lie on his back, extending his legs and arms, and then three cauterizations should be performed. One cauterization should be made below the pit of the stomach, the size of a finger, with a nail-like cautery; and two cauterizations lower down, on either side of the single cauterization, so that the cauterizations form a triangle, and sufficiently far apart that they do not coalesce if they suppurate. The depth of the cautery should be about two-thirds the thickness of the skin.  This will be the shape of the cauterizations.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cautery iron with which you perform this single cauterization should be in the shape of a circle, in this manner.
And the stomach may be cauterized by puncturing it for someone who shrinks from this cauterization. This is done by marking points on the stomach with ink to the extent desired, then cauterizing them with a pointed cautery, then treating it with the previously described treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the cold cauterization of the liver.
If there arises from the liver a pain due to coldness and dampness or due to a slight wind, so that it has departed from its natural temperament excessively, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the classification, and that does not work. Then the patient should lie on his back, and three cauterizations should be marked with ink in this shape and this exact amount on the liver below the diaphragm, where the human elbow ends.
And after each cauterization there will be a cauterization of the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization will be along the body straight, and do not press down firmly with the cautery.
Let the amount burned of the thickness of the skin be half of it, not more, and let the patient stand on his feet; if he is not standing, let him lie down with his legs extended and his arms raised. And this is the image of the cautery.
And you may be able to cauterize these cauterizations with the knife-cautery if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be careful lest you overdo the cauterization and burn all the skin, burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so know that.
Chapter twenty-eight.
On cauterizing a swelling of the liver.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know if that swelling is in the flesh of the liver or in its peritoneum, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the peritoneum of the liver, there will be intense sharpness with the pain, and if you see that the physicians have been unable to treat it, then the patient should lie on his back, and then you should mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire; it is the cautery that resembles a hoe, and this is its form. And cauterize it with one cauterization until you burn all the skin and the cauterization reaches the peritoneum so that all the matter comes out, then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should not be used except by one whose experience in the art of medicine is long and who has repeatedly treated these diseases; then he may undertake such work, but leaving it is better in my opinion.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with the roots of rhubarb for a cold fistula in this manner: that you take one long dry root of rhubarb, the longest you can find, and let it be about the thickness of a finger, then dip it in oil and hold it in the fire. Then cauterize with one cauterization between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauterizations a little below the jugulars, slightly inclined toward the side under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two cauterizations also between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined backward, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach, and three cauterizations from behind: one between the shoulders, and two on the sides of the loins, lower than the cauterization which is between the shoulders.
And you should not deepen your hand with the cautery, but it should be superficially on the skin like a fumigation.  Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used a cauterizing iron like a file, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reaches the tumor itself.
And the pus is removed as we mentioned in the tumor of the liver. In this method of cauterization, there is great danger; either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula forms in the place which will not heal.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you treat the disease of the spleen with what we have mentioned in the classification and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is done in three ways, all of which are correct. One is to cauterize it with three or four cauterizations lined up along the length of the spleen.
In the shape of the liver cauterizations whose form we have presented, and between each cauterization and another there should be the width of a finger or slightly more. The nature of the cautery should be the same as that which we mentioned in the cauterization of the liver.  Do not deepen your hand with the cautery, and the patient's position should be lying on his back.
The second method is in the armpit.  You raise the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left armpit ends, and you raise the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left armpit ends. Your raising of the skin should be across the width of the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then you insert two cautery irons, very carefully, until they penetrate the skin on the other side, then you remove the cautery iron.  The cauterizations will then be four. And if you wish, you may cauterize with the other cautery iron with three points.
Then you treat the site of the cauterization after you leave it to drain pus for many days; this is more effective than all the treatments that have preceded it.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterization for dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial in particular for ascitic dropsy. If you treat the dropsical patient with the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, a cauterization on the spleen, and two cauterizations on his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the cauterization open to drain pus for a long time.
And do not deprive the patient of treatment after cauterization with what is necessary to combine the two purposes, so that healing hastens to him.  The shape of the cautery iron with which the back is cauterized is nail-shaped, as its shape was described previously, and that with which the abdomen is cauterized is olive-shaped.
Chapter thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the hollow between the little toe and the ring finger.
And place your hand with the cautery iron and do not bend it, then raise your hand and do not return it at all, for the yellow water will ooze out, and the cautery iron is of this shape.
Then cauterize on the legs, two cauterizations on each leg. The cauterization should be with the sharp end of the cautery iron, and the cauterization should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below it towards the middle of the leg, and on each thigh two cauterizations.
And leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, so that the water may ooze out, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On cauterization for diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and dampness, to the point that it weakens the retaining and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various treatments but has not healed, and you see the patient able to tolerate cauterization and strong, then cauterize him with a large cauterization on his stomach. As was mentioned previously in cauterizing the stomach with the circular cautery iron, and four cauterizations around the navel with a gentle, nail-shaped cautery iron, and a large cauterization on the coccyx with cotton, or two cauterizations.
If you see the dampness is abundant and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize him on the pubis and on each flank, and perhaps add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment whose benefit is not missed, God willing.
Chapter thirty-four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are chronic, numerous, or single hemorrhoids in the anus, and they are from thick, cold humors or putrid moisture, and they have been treated with what we mentioned in the section, and the treatment has not been effective, then cauterize the patient with three cauterizations on the lower part of the sacrum below the coccyx a little, forming a triangle.
And a cauterization below the navel by the length of two fingers; and if you judge that his stomach has become cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization as previously mentioned, and a cauterization on his liver. And another on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for a time, then treat him until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery which resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the same cut wart and persevere until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which the blood flows; do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal.  And if you cauterize a large area with cotton, it will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula which is in the anus and its surroundings.
If the patient does not consent to the incision and the procedure we described in its place and shrinks from it, then perhaps he will heal by cauterization. If a fistula occurs and the pus and corrupt humors flow from it for a long time, then the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then ascertain the depth of its channel with a probe. Then heat the cautery iron which resembles a needle, and insert it, hot, into the fistula itself, along the course of the fistula and to the depth that the probe reached, and repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt substances are burned, once or twice or three times, according to your need.
And be careful not to burn a nerve if there is one, or a large vein, and if the fistula opens into the substance of the bladder or into the substance of the intestine.
Therefore, be careful of all these areas.  You should only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you have assessed that it is not penetrating. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area closes and the flow stops and remains so for a time, then know that it has healed completely.
And if the flow does not stop, then know that it is penetrating, or that in its channel there is a corrupt bone, or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On cauterizing the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or a strong wind, and this causes a decrease in the patient's sexual activity, then it should be cauterized on the loins, over the kidneys themselves.  Cauterize each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery mentioned previously. And perhaps you should cauterize it a third time in the same place. So three cauterizations are applied in a row, and this will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it: one cauterization below the navel, on the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and one cauterization to the right of the navel, and another to the left.
The distance after cauterization on each side should be the width of a thumb. And cauterize one or two times in the lower back, if needed. The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On cauterizing the womb.
If a substance forms in the womb due to cold and moisture, thus preventing conception, corrupting its substance, and hindering menstruation or causing pain during its arrival, then three cauterizations should be made around the navel, as mentioned in cauterizing the bladder. One or two cauterizations on cotton in the lower back, and the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Humoral fluids may accumulate in the hip joint, causing it to dislocate.  The sign is that one leg will appear longer than the other when they are compared, and the site of the dislocation will feel empty.  Therefore, the patient should be cauterized in a semi-circular fashion directly over the hip joint itself.
After marking with ink around the joint in a circular fashion so that the joint itself lies in the center of the circle, use the cautery shown in the illustration for cauterizing the stomach. If you do not have this cautery, use three cauterizations with a large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cauterization deep enough to penetrate the entire thickness of the skin, then treat [the wound] until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-one.
On cauterizing sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and dampness, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the classification, but the treatment has not been effective and the condition has become chronic, then it is necessary to evacuate the thick humors from the patient using foul-smelling beans or prickly pear fruit, or something similar.
Then shave it and apply cautery in two ways: either cautery with burning medicines or cautery with fire. Cautery with fire can be done in many ways; one of them is to cauterize the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
Make them of a suitable depth, and the distance between each cauterization should be the width of a finger.  The cautery iron should be olive-shaped.  Alternatively, you may cauterize one in the middle, on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations.  Or, if you wish, cauterize it with the circle previously mentioned in cauterizing a dislocated hip, as a single cauterization.
So that the circle encompasses the entire hip and burns through the entire thickness of the skin. This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize two areas on the thigh where the patient indicates pain, and one above the malleolus, four fingers towards the lateral side, slightly. The cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should only be the thickness of the skin.
And if he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize where he indicates with a pointed cautery iron, three or four times, or more if necessary. And if he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to burn a nerve or a large artery, lest you cause the patient a serious or lasting harm.
And I have seen one and another who was cauterized above the malleolus, and the cauterization was excessive, so that the leg became gangrenous until the gangrene reached the foot and perforated it entirely, and the whole leg became corrupted, and then diarrhea and death followed. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize both in the same manner.
Some learned physicians have mentioned a cauterization of the hip of this kind:  A cup-like instrument is made of iron, its diameter half a span, and its mouth the thickness of a date pit, or a little less; and inside this cup is another cup, and a third.
The distance between each cup is the width of a thumb's knuckle; the cups are open on both sides, and their height is about a knuckle or two knuckles.  A handle of well-secured iron is attached to them.  This is its image.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, then it is placed on the hip joint, the patient leaning on the sound side, and three round cauterizations are performed at once. Then he is left for three days, and the wound is dressed with butter, and the wound is left open for days.
Many then treat it with ointment until it heals. The author of this book says: We have rarely used this type of cauterization because of its ugliness and the horror of its appearance, and because few are found who can endure it; however, it is a good cauterization for those who endure it and whose ailment is in the correct location.
As for cauterization with burning drugs, it is done by making two cup-like things, similar to the rings through which the hinges of a door pass, of copper or iron.
Their rims are raised about two finger-widths or so, and the distance between them is the width of a finger. They are open at the bottom and open at the top, and are held together in this manner.
Then you place it on the hip joint, the patient lying on his sound side, and you hold your hand firmly, then you pour between the circles some sharp water, which is warmed a little by the fire, and you hold it for the time of an hourglass, and the patient endures its stinging and burning, for he feels a burning like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then you lift the instrument with your hand and wipe the sharp water from the entire hip with fresh water, then you leave it for three days and apply butter to it until the blackness of the burn disappears, and you leave it for days so that pus flows from it, for that is more effective.
Then you treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, you make a mold for it that holds the water, in the same way as you did for the hip.  This is the description of the sharp water, and I have already mentioned it in the chapter on the preparation of drugs.
Take one part of alkali salt and one part of unslaked lime, crush them, and place them in a new pot which has a single small hole in its bottom, large enough for a probe to pass through.  Place another glazed pot under the bottom of the pot.
And pour on the alkali and lime enough fresh water to cover them by a finger's breadth, after you have pressed them down firmly with your hand. Leave the pot until the sharp water drips into the glazed pot below. Then collect all that water, and pour it over more fresh lime and alkali.
Then it will be very strong and sharp, useful in many medical procedures and for cauterizing various members, because it acts just like fire itself. Among the medicaments that also cauterize the hip are thapsia, honey of spurge, and lime with soap, well mixed.
Galen recounted a story from an ancient man about a treatment for hip pain and sciatica, and he greatly emphasized it, claiming that no other treatment is needed and that it cures with a single application.
To the point that someone might enter the bath carried and leave cured.  This is done by taking green borage; if green is not available, take fresh dry borage, finely grind it with some fat, and apply it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg or thigh.
Then bind it on and leave it for three hours, or however long the patient feels the burning subside. Then bring him to the bath. When his body is damp, put him in the bath. Then, God willing, the pain will go away and he will be cured. If he is not cured, repeat the application after ten days.
Then, God willing, he will be cured. And know that one should not cauterize with these medicaments except after purging the body. Dioscorides mentioned that if sciatica is cauterized with goat hair, it is beneficial.
The cauterization is done in this way: take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow place between the thumb and the forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat hair.
Ignite it with fire until it becomes a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. Then take another and continue doing this until sensation reaches from the middle of the arm to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called cauterization with goat hair.
Chapter forty-two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Pain in the back may arise from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like. It may be from the effusion of a cold, moist substance; cauterization is only for this type.
That which is from the effusion of a cold substance: after the patient has vomited with the hellebore and the like, he should be cauterized on his back where the pain is, three rows across the width of the table itself, after marking the location with ink.  In each row, five cauterizations or more, according to what you see the patient can tolerate and his strength.
The cauterization should be with a pointed cautery; and if you wish, cauterize it three or four times with a medium-sized nail cautery, in this manner.
Chapter forty-three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
This ailment frequently affects young children.  Its initial sign in a child is shortness of breath upon standing and movement, and you will find at the end of his spinal vertebrae a bead that has protruded, standing out from the other beads.
If you see this and wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery iron of this shape. Let the cauterization take hold on each side of the vertebra equally. And if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery iron in two or three rows, and let the points be close to one another. Then treat the area until it heals as we have mentioned.
And take care not to use cautery in a hump that is due to a nerve spasm.
Chapter forty-four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are due to cold humors that settle in any member of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, then it is customary for physicians to call this gout, especially.
If gout caused by cold is treated with the various methods we mentioned in the classification, and the pains do not go away, then cauterization will remove them.  This is done by cauterizing around the joints of the legs with many cauterizations after vomiting. The cautery should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, in this manner.
And if you need to cauterize the surface of the leg, do so with a pointed cautery. If the pains ascend to the knees or to the other joints, and this often happens, cauterize each knee with three or four cauterizations on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery.
If you need more cauterization, cauterize, but do not deepen your application, rather it should be only about the thickness of the skin. If the pains ascend to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned concerning cauterization in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, cauterize around the forearms as if circling two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, cauterize each knuckle with one cauterization and the metacarpus. If the pains ascend after several days to the elbows or to the shoulders,
cauterize them on each side. The patient should not be without good treatment and the taking of medicines, for if he improves his diet and evacuates phlegm, he will be cured with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter forty-five.
On cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some intestine and fat descends to the testicle, and this is recent and early, then you should order the patient to abstain from food that day and to use laxatives which will move the stool from his abdomen.
Then he should lie on his back before you, and you should tell him to restrain himself until the fat or intestine protrudes, then you should return it with your finger.  Then mark with ink below the hernia on the pubic bone a sign resembling a semicircle, its ends towards the upper part of the body.
Then heat a cautery of this shape.
Until it becomes white and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or fat to the abdomen. Then let an assistant place his hand on the place lest the intestine protrude.  And you have parted the patient's legs and placed a cushion under him, and another assistant ties his legs.
And another on his chest holds his hands. Then lower the cautery onto the same mark, and your hand with the cautery should be upright and straight, and hold it until it reaches the bone, or repeat it again if it did not reach the bone the first time.
And guard against the protrusion of the intestine while you cauterize, lest you burn it, which would cause the patient either death or a great calamity. And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not have succeeded. And the cautery should be gentle for children according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with butter until the scabbing from the fire disappears. Then treat it with other ointments until it heals. And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound closes.
And you should make his diet during his treatment that which softens his bowels, lest the intestine protrude during defecation. Then, if he wants to get up after forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days. And let him reduce exertion, overeating and drinking, and loud shouting.
For if this procedure is used in this way, he will be completely healed, God willing. And I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing. As for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is beginning, if you want it not to increase, cauterize a round mark on it, corresponding to its size. And let what you burn of the skin be about two-thirds of it. Then treat it as we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing. And some of the ancients mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After you have drawn on the hernia with ink, making the horizontal line at the upper side of the hernia and the other line downwards, and placing your hand in the middle, apply one nail-shaped cautery.  The first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter forty-six.
In cauterizing the fistula.
If pain occurs in some member from a fall or a blow, and that pain lasts a long time, and medication does not alleviate it, then it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery. The cauterization of each member should be according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And if the pain and fistula persist, then if it heals from the first cauterization, well and good; otherwise, repeat the cauterization. For it is the nature of these pains to move from one member to its neighbor, so you should follow them with cautery until the patient is cured.
Chapter forty-seven.
In cauterizing leprosy.
As for lepers, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that comes from the corruption of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize, consider: if the leprosy is incipient and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the classification, and it has not subsided nor stopped, and you fear that corruption will overwhelm the whole constitution of the patient, then cauterize him on the head with five cauterizations. One in the middle of the head, as is customary; the second below it towards the forehead at the hairline; two on the temples; and one at the back on the nape of the neck.  And exert yourself a little with the cauterization until it slightly affects the bone.
And scales will be shed from it, so that the thick vapors may more easily escape.  Cauterize also the spleen in the same manner as before. But if the leprosy has persisted in the patient and become clearly manifest, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauterizations which we mentioned on the head. And a cauterization on the tip of the nose, two cauterizations on the cheeks, two cauterizations on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, one large cauterization on the coccyx at the base of the spine, and another above it in the same place, and two on the hips, one on each hip. And two on the knees, one on each knee; and two on the shoulders; and two on the elbows; and two on the breasts; and cauterize each joint of the fingers of his hands and feet with one cauterization; and each heel of his feet and forearms.
And be careful of the nerve which is on the back of the heels, lest you burn them.  And it may be that a cauterization is performed on the pubic bone, and another on the stomach, and another on the liver. And know that the more cauterizations you perform, the more beneficial and effective it will be.
And know that the patient does not feel the pain of cauterization as much as a healthy person, because his body is numb. And the cauteries should be large and small according to the organs and joints, as described in the characteristics of the cauteries.
Then treat the cauterization with barley flour mixed with honey and other treatments until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-eight.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness: When a limb becomes numb and is treated with medicines, ointments, and dressings, but does not heal, cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the limb, whether large or small. Let your cauterization be deep enough to penetrate the thickness of the skin a little.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  Sometimes, some numbness that affects the hand and foot in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb may be cauterized, and the numbness will go away.
And let no one undertake this except one who is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter forty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of vitiligo.
If vitiligo is longstanding and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it slightly, to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour mixed with rose oil, lamb's tongue, and pigeon's or partridge's blood—one part of each. Mix everything together, apply it to a cloth, and bind it to the area until it heals.
Chapter fifty.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is incipient and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it grows. Some wise men have mentioned cauterizing it intensely in the middle, but I do not see this as advisable, because I expect that it will ulcerate, and I have witnessed this many times.
Therefore, the correct method is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we said, or with many small cauterizations.
Chapter fifty-one.
Concerning the cauterization of hemorrhoids.
If a hemorrhoid develops and is slow to mature, either because of the excessive strength of the humors, or because of the patient's age if he is old and anemic, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the hemorrhoid, cauterize around it with many small, punctate cauterizations.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation. If you wish to stop it with cauterization, take the cautery iron whose image is this.
And insert it into the middle of the hemorrhoid until it penetrates the skin. Let the cauterization be from what is below, so that the pus may flow easily. Then treat it appropriately until it heals.
Chapter fifty-two.
On cauterizing the canker.
A canker is a corruption that spreads in a member, eating it as fire eats dry wood. If you see a canker in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, take many small and large, nail-shaped cauteries, according to what is suitable for that place where the canker is.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing at all remains. Then leave it for three days and apply to the cauterized areas powdered sulfur with oil until all the eschar and all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with ointments that grow flesh. If you see after three days that the flesh grows healthy growth with no corruption, otherwise repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas. And a canker may be treated with a sharp medicine.
For it acts in place of fire, more quickly beneficial. And I have mentioned its treatment with a sharp medicine in the classification, so take it from there when you need it.
Chapter fifty-three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This ailment often occurs in the soles of the feet; it is a rough thing that pains the person.  Cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a sharp liquid.
As for cauterization with fire, you heat a hollow cautery iron resembling an eagle's feather, made of iron to the extent that it surrounds the nail on all sides, and it should have a thin edge. Then you apply it hot to the nail, and then you rotate the iron around the nail until the iron reaches the depth of the nail.
And you leave it for three days, during which pus will form, then you apply a dressing of pounded wild lettuce with salt, and leave the dressing on it overnight. Then it will be extracted from its roots, and then treat the wound site with a flesh-regenerating ointment until it heals, if the nails are not inverted.
This often occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet.  You should take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's feather and place it over the nail or wart, then pour a little of the sharp liquid into the tube.
Hold your hand as you rotate it, gently pressing with your hand so that the edge of the tube affects the root of the nail, and the sharp liquid finds its way to the root of the nail. The patient should endure the stinging of the sharp liquid for a short time.
Then leave it, for the nail will be extracted by its roots. Do this one by one until you have treated all of them on the body, then treat the areas after they are removed with ointments that regenerate flesh.
Chapter fifty-four.
On cauterizing scabs.
If a scab develops from a cold in the nerve, or from a fever blister or something else, then it should be cauterized four or five times, on the vertebrae of the back, with a cauterization between each vertebra, and a cauterization on the chest. And a cauterization on his stomach with an olive-shaped cautery iron, for the scab will subside and hasten the maturation of the cold illness.
Chapter fifty-five.
On cauterizing pustules that occur on the body.
Ugly pustules may erupt on the body, caused by thick, corrupt, cold substances.  At their first appearance, each pustule should be gently cauterized with a thin cautery iron whose tip has been heated in the fire, or with a long cautery iron from a zarwan plant, or with a lentil-shaped cautery iron.
And boils may be cauterized at their first eruption in this manner, so that the active cause does not increase, and it dissipates, and the patient recovers from them; however, this should be done after the patient has been bled.
Chapter fifty-six.
On cauterizing bleeding that occurs when an artery is cut.
Often, bleeding from a severed artery occurs from an external wound, or when an abscess is incised, or when a member is cauterized, and so forth,  and it is difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the mouth of the artery and press it firmly to contain the blood under your finger so that nothing comes out. Then, place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and heat them until they are very hot.
Then take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the place where the artery has been opened.  Quickly remove your finger and apply the cautery to the same vessel and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If, when you remove your finger from the mouth of the artery, the bleeding resumes and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those in the fire that have been prepared, and continue to do this, one after another, until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve, lest another affliction befall the patient. Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization, as we have said; or by amputation, if it has not already been severed; for if it is severed, its ends contract and the bleeding stops; or by tightly tying it with threads; or by applying medications that stop bleeding, and binding it firmly with bandages.
As for anyone who attempts to stop it with a ligature, or by tight bandaging, or by applying cauterizing agents, and the like, it will never be stopped in this way except rarely. If this happens to someone and a physician or medication is not available, he should immediately place the index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
He should press it very hard until the bleeding ceases and flows from above the wound and onto the artery. The finger should not be removed, and cold water, very cold, should constantly be applied to it until the blood clots, thickens, and stops.  During this time, consider what else is needed in the way of cautery or medicine.
Chapter Two.
Concerning incisions, punctures, bloodletting, wounds, and the like.
Khalaf said: In the first chapter we mentioned every ailment suitable for cauterization with fire and caustic medication, its causes and reasons, its instruments, the shapes of cautery irons, and we made that into sections, from the head to the foot.
And I follow in this chapter the same path, so that what the student requires may be easier for him.
Before I begin with that, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains more pitfalls than the first chapter on cautery.
And because of that, warning should be stronger in this, for in the work of this chapter, there frequently occurs the evacuation of blood by which life is sustained, when opening a vein or making an incision on a tumor, or puncturing an abscess, or treating a wound, or extracting an arrow, or incising a stone, and the like, all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and in most of them death occurs.
And I advise you against falling into what is doubtful for you; for in this craft, various kinds of people may come to you with various kinds of illnesses, and among them are those who are weary of their illness and to whom death is easy.
Because of the severity of what he finds in his illness, and the length of his affliction, and in the illness there is evidence of death; and some give you their money and enrich you with it in hope of health, and his illness is fatal, so you should never help at all whoever comes to you who is of this description.
Let your caution be stronger than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed to anything of that except after certain knowledge that is confirmed with you as to what the favorable outcome will be, and in all the treatment of your patients, employ the priority of knowledge and warning as to what leads to safety.
For in that you have help in acquiring praise, glory, mention, and thanks. May God inspire you, O my sons, with His guidance, and may He not forbid you from truth and success; indeed, that is in His hand; there is no god but He.
And I have arranged this chapter in sections, as preceded in the chapter on cauterization, from the horn to the foot, so that what you want from it may be easier for you, God willing.
Chapter One.
In the treatment of the water that collects in the heads of children.
This ailment often affects infants at birth if the midwife presses the infant's head without gentleness, and it may also occur from a hidden cause that is not known.
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than infants, and all those I have seen of them have quickly died; therefore, I have seen fit to leave treatment of it. And I have seen an infant whose head was full of water, and the head grew larger every day. Until the infant could not sit up by himself because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he perished.
And this moisture either collects between the skin and the bone, or it collects under the bone on the peritoneum.  The procedure is that if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the swelling is small, then it is necessary to make a single incision across the middle of the head, and the length of the incision should be about two fingerbreadths, so that the moisture flows out. This is the image of the scalpel.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling is larger, then make two intersecting incisions in this manner:.
And if the moisture is under the bone—and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side, and the water sinks down if you press it with your hand inwards, and this is not hidden from you—then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
And after the incision, all the moisture comes out, then you bind the incisions with cloths and bandages, then you bathe it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day, then you untie the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments.  And do not leave off binding the head moderately, and feed the patient with every dry food with little moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals. Another description of the incision is that you look where the bone of the swelling and the collection of water appear, because it may be in the back of the head more, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
Then you aim with the incision where the swelling and the fullness of water appear to you, so you incise it as much as you can, and be careful not to cut a vein, lest bleeding occur and the patient die from that bleeding along with the evacuation of the moisture.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears known as the "al-ḥasīsayn".
When someone is afflicted with acute catarrh in the eyes or chest, and this persists and medication does not work, then the most effective treatment for this is cutting these two arteries.
So, if you want to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the artery, then tie the patient's neck with the edge of his garment, then look where the pulse beats and their location, the two low-lying places behind the ears, and they rarely hide except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with a lancet, cutting to the bone. This should be done across the head, or if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and cut upwards. The length of the cut should be about two joined fingers.
If the artery is cut, the blood will gush out in a pulsating manner, leaping forward and continuously flowing. If the artery is not palpable, you should measure three fingers from the ear, then mark it with ink and incise to the bone.  What should be...
...sent forth from the blood six ounces on average, and perhaps more or less, all this according to the strength of the patient and the fullness of his arteries that you see. Then look at the wound; if some peritoneum remains on the bone, cut it away.
lest a hot inflammation occur. Then bind the wound with a thread of linen rags and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Incising the two arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic migraine or acute attacks caused by sharp humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headache and the like, and he has been treated with various medical treatments without success, then we have tried in these diseases to incise the arteries of the temples or cauterize them, as we have described.
The procedure for incising them is that the patient's hair in the temples should be shaved, and the artery visible in the temple should be targeted, for it will be apparent to you from its pulsation, and it rarely hides except in a few people.
Or if it is very cold, then if it is hidden from you, let the patient tighten his neck with the excess of his garment, then you rub the area with a cloth or compress the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly and evidently. Then take the scalpel, whose image is this. Then you incise the skin gently with it until you reach the artery, then you throw a hook into it and pull it upwards until you bring it out of the skin and free it from the membranes underneath it from every side; if the artery is thin, then twist it with the tip of the hook. Then cut off a section of it to the extent that its ends are separated and constricted, and do not cause bleeding, for if it is not severed and not cut, the blood will not flow at all, then blood is evacuated from six ounces to three.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread, and let the thread be either of silk or of lute strings, lest corruption reach it before the wound heals, and bleeding occurs.
Then cut what is between the two ligatures; do this at that time or after another time. And if you wish to cauterize it with a knife-like cautery to the bone until its ends are severed, it will serve the same purpose or better, as we have said.
Unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, because cauterization is what helps in the consumption of humors, and it will be more effective. After tying off the two arteries, the area should be packed with worn cotton and firm dressings applied, and after healing, it should be treated with drying medicines that grow flesh and with bandaging until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your work, quickly cut it, either by cauterization or by filling the area with vitriol and squeezing your hand until the blood stops.  If you do not have any of that, place your finger until the blood clots.
And wash the area with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and bind it as necessary.  What is easier than ligating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the two points with ink.
And apply it very hot until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed in two places so that its ends are separated, for it will not reunite with this cauterization at all.  This is the image of the cautery.
The blades should be sharp, resembling small awls, except that they should be much less sharp than a knife, because if they are as sharp as a knife, they will cool more quickly and the flesh will not be severed quickly.  If they have some thickness, the heat of the fire will be retained in them.
And the flesh is severed quickly. This method is better than any other method, and lighter and easier. The distance between the blades should be the width of a finger.
Chapter Four.
In the treatment of the constant flow of hot tears into the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the vessels on the cranium from the outside, and nothing from medical treatment with medicines has been beneficial, and you see the patient's face has reddened. And he feels in his forehead a crawling like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their lids corroded and their eyelids clinging together from the severity of the tears.  The ancients in treating it resorted to this procedure, and they call it treatment with the scalpel; it is that you order the patient to have the hair shaved from his forehead.
Then you make three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead. The length of each incision should be about two fingers, one incision parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second a little distance from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from the connection of the jaws.  Let the distance between each incision be about three fingers' breadth.  And let you have prepared pieces of sponge or many dry cloths to wipe away the blood.
Then insert the double-edged scalpel, whose image is this. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, and with it flay all the skin that is between the two incisions, together with the periosteum on the bone. Then do the same also from the middle incision to the third incision, then remove this scalpel. And insert into the first incision also another instrument called a knife, sharp on one side and smooth, not sharp, on the other side. And this is its image:
And place its sharp side upwards towards the flesh adhering to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do this in the middle incision to the other incision. And after a moderate amount of blood has flowed, squeeze the places of the clotted blood, then place in each incision a pledget of cotton, and place over it a compress moistened with a drink and oil, or vinegar and oil.
Lest a hot swelling occur. And on the third day, loosen the bandage and use much irrigation with lukewarm water, then treat it with basil ointment with rose oil and all that you treat wounds with, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from the interior of the head.
When someone experiences frequent, sharp, severe, constant discharges, and you see his eyes weak, small, and his vision weakened, and his eyelids ulcerated and the eyelashes falling out. And there is severe, painful pain in the depth of the head and continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment is this treatment: You should order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is severe, painful pain in the depth of the head and continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment is this treatment: You should order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or slightly higher, laterally, beginning the incision from the left temple to the right temple.  The incision should reach the bone, and keep your hand away from the temporal muscles that move during chewing, until the bone is exposed and all the blood is dried with a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with old cotton or a linen thread. Then tie it from above with bandages, and soak the bandages with syrup and oil, lest a hot inflammation occur.  When you untie them and see that the hot inflammation has subsided, you should scrape the bone until the growth of flesh begins.
Then treat it with a drying preparation that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, preparing an ointment from them, and using it for flesh growth in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Whatever falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone, or something like stone such as iron and glass; or a vegetable seed like chickpea and kernel and the like; or a fluid thing like water and vinegar and the like.
Or an animal.  When a stone or a kind of stone falls into the ear which does not grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun. Then, if you see the stone, instill some violet oil or cerate into it, then try to remove it by moving the head or sneezing with a handkerchief. And block the nostrils at the time of sneezing after you place a ring of rags or wool around the ear and extend the ear upwards. Often it comes out with this treatment. If it does not come out otherwise, then try to remove it with a soft probe, the image of which is this.
If it comes out with the probe, otherwise try to remove it with a gentle, slightly curved, blind probe. If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the hole of the ear gently.
And seal what is around the tube with pitch softened with oil, lest there be a path for the wind other than the tube. Then draw it with your breath strongly, and often it comes out with that. If it does not come out in the way we described, then take a little of the Nabataean mastic or of the prepared mastic which is used to catch birds, and place it on the end of a probe.
After you wrap it tightly with cotton, then insert it gently into the hole of the ear after you dry the ear from moisture. If it does not come out with all that we described, then hasten to incision before hot swelling or tension occurs.
The description of the incision is that you first bleed the patient in the cephalic vein and let out blood according to his strength. Then you sit the patient between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near its lobe in its lowest part.
And the incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can. Then quickly suture the incision and treat it until it heals.
And if the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, then try to remove it as we mentioned. If it does not respond to removal, then take a thin, fine scalpel of this shape.
And try with it to cut that type of seed that has fallen into the ear.  You do this only if you are certain that the seed has become moistened by the vapor of the ear so that it becomes many small pieces, then remove them with a blind probe, or with a fine spatula, or by suction.
As we have mentioned, then it is easy to remove it. As for water entering the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with hellebore, having filled his ear with some old cotton while lying on the ear in which the water is. If it comes out with that,
otherwise, take many small, smooth, flat stones the length of the fingers, warm them slightly by the fire, and the patient inserts one into the opening of his ear. He should then press down with his foot on that side and strike the stone in the ear with another stone.
He continues to do this with stone after stone until all the water comes out. The water may also come out by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather and inserting one end into the ear and bringing the other end to the fire until most of it burns, then another feather is used.
Do this repeatedly until all the water comes out or draw it out with a tube as previously described for the stone. As for removing an animal that has entered, look: if it is small in size, like a flea or similar, treat it as I mentioned in the section, but...
if its body is large and perceptible to the touch, try removing it with forceps and hooks. This is easier than anything else that lodges in the ear. As for removing worms generated in the ear, if you treat it as we mentioned in the section on instillations and your treatment is not effective,
you should look into the ear in the sun. If you see anything of the worms, remove them with forceps or fine hooks. If you do not see anything, take a tube of this shape.
narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, and insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate. Then suck strongly. Do this repeatedly until all the worms come out. If they do not come out, seal around the tube with wax as I described for the stone.
If they do not come out by what we have mentioned, use the instillations that I have mentioned, which the ancients have tried in killing worms. You will find this in the section on instillations.  The pouring of oils and medicines into the ear should be done with this instrument, and this is its image:
As you see, make it of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top. If you wish, the nozzle inside the tube can be made of tightly fitting copper.  If you wish, you can take a reed and tightly wrap cotton around its end.
Then pour the oil or juice or whatever medicine you want into the tube while it is in the ear. Then insert the reed with cotton from above and squeeze it moderately with your hand until the oil is forced into the ear and is felt.
The patient feels it entering.  What you pour into the ear should be warmed slightly in the fire, and be careful that what is dropped in is neither very cold nor very hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
In the treatment of the obstruction affecting the ear.
Some children may be born with their ear canals not perforated.
It may also happen that some people experience an obstruction in the ear canal from a wound or from growing flesh. This obstruction may be deep within the ear canal, unseen by the eye.
It may also appear slightly outside the opening and be visible. That which appears deep within the ear and is not visible is, in most cases, difficult to cure.  That which is visible, the patient's ear should be placed in the sun. And you should look at it. If you see the obstruction is visible, open it with a delicate scalpel, which has this shape:
Its tip should be slightly broad, the rest of the scalpel smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear. If the obstruction is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate hook and cut it gently until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a smooth, delicate probe, warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction, and the patient feels a heaviness in hearing, remove it gently.
Take care not to injure the membrane of the ear. Then insert into the ear a tent of a size appropriate for the opening, having coated it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure the wound will not close up. Or, take a tent, moisten it in water and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it.
Use this. If you see the ear has swollen with a hot inflammation, you should remove the tent and replace it with another tent coated in a preparation made with rose oil to calm the hot inflammation, then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear. Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding mentioned in the chapter on styptics.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts which appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  You should grasp them with forceps or a hook and cut them from their base with a scalpel, then apply powdered verdigris to the area.
If it bleeds, cauterize it with a mild lentil-shaped cautery. Cauterization is better after cutting.  It often returns if any of its roots remain; if cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and it will not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of the cold affecting the eyelids.
Something resembling a cold in its intensity and hardness often appears in the eyelids.
Therefore it is called a cold, which is a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids.  The treatment is to look: if the coldness is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves to every side, then it is easy; make a transverse incision on it.
Then gently peel it from every side until it is freed, then hang it with a hook and cut it. If you cannot cut it except after penetrating the eyelid with the cut, that does not harm the patient. If the incision is large, close it with sutures and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, there is no harm from it, for ointment will heal and join it. If the coldness is inclined towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid over and hang the coldness with a hook without needing an incision, and cut it from every side.
If it penetrates the eyelid with the cut, that does not harm. Then wash the eye after cutting the coldness with salt water and treat the area with what joins until the patient heals.
Chapter Ten.
In the treatment of the stye which appears in the eyelid.
A stye is a lump that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and this mostly occurs in boys. It weighs down their eyes and they experience colds in the mornings, and they are unable to look at sunlight. Because the tears rush to them.
Therefore you see them always leaning on their faces and sleeping on them, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, with swelling upon them, and the stye is clearly visible.  When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the stye between them. The method of treatment is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then you take a linen cloth and prepare a wick from it, and make from that wick a circle the size of what surrounds the stye from every side, then you place it on it and press with your fingers from every side to gather the stye in the middle of the circle.
Then you make an incision in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, a transverse incision, and the incision should not be larger than the incision that is made in bloodletting. As for the depth, you should cut all the skin until you reach the stye.
Then, in most cases, the stye protrudes from the incision in the form of a white piece of fat. You pull it out with a cloth that you have wrapped between your fingers, while you turn your hand right and left until it is healed. Beware of increasing the incision lest the lancet reach the eye and injure it.
If the stye does not appear to you at the first incision, you should increase the incision a little gently until the stye appears, then pull it out as we said, then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area and bandage it. Some people crush salt.
And they place it inside the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On types of eyelid inflammation.
If extra eyelashes grow on the eyelid, outside the natural course, under the natural eyelashes and brows, then they harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, and whiteness and thickness, until it becomes a cause of blindness in the eye.
Eyelid inflammation is of four types: either cauterization with fire, or with a strong medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or the inflammation may be treated by excision and suturing or with a reed, as I will mention.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns, well and good; otherwise, insert a needle with thread from below the eyelid, passing the needle with thread from above, near the hair itself, and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.
Turn it with a probe, then incise within the eyelid, below the extra hairs, with a sharp scalpel, from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus. Then remove the thread and place a small pledget of cotton or cloth under the eyelid. Then mark the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of a laurel leaf, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to raise the eyelid, because this varies among people; some need a suitable amount of eyelid to be cut according to how much the eyelid has relaxed.
And some need less to be cut, all that according to the relaxation of the eyelid. Then incise with the scalpel along the two lines that you marked, beginning from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, and let each incision be near the natural hair, about the thickness of a probe.
Then insert the hook into one corner of the skin and peel it all off. Then, using a needle and fine woolen thread, stitch the edges together. Wipe away the blood and stick the remaining threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substance.
If you wish to do that, otherwise it doesn't matter. Then leave the stitches and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. If you wish, you may leave the wound without stitching and treat it with what dries and contracts, for the eyelid rises when the wound closes and heals; stitching is better.
This method of blepharoplasty was mentioned by the ancients, although it is burdensome for the patient. It is a good method and there is no danger in it.  Another method of blepharoplasty is also to mark on the eyelid a shape like that of a laurel leaf, as we described. Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, either separated or grouped in this manner:
Then cut off the excess eyelid with small scissors, in this manner, in even pieces.
If you cannot hold the hooks and they do not remain steady for you, then take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger canthus and a third thread near the smaller canthus.  Gather the threads together evenly with your fingers, then raise them with a steady hand.
Raise the marked skin entirely as we described, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If a hot inflammation appears when you cut or incise, then calm that inflammation with qirūṭī and similar soothing ointments.
It may also happen that the lower eyelid inverts its margins; then you should use what we mentioned of cutting and suturing and cauterization with fire, and with a caustic medicine. Cauterization with fire or with a caustic medicine is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and suturing, and you should perform cutting and suturing in both.
Cauterization with a reed is done in this way: you invert the eyelid and make an incision on the inside as described, then you make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length equal to the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
And you carve at their ends on both sides where the threads are attached, then gently bring them together over what remains of the eyelid and tightly pull the reeds from both sides and leave it for a few days. Then the stretched skin dies, turns black, and decays.
Until it falls off by itself. If it is slow, then cut it with scissors, then treat it until it heals. When it has healed, the eyelid will be raised and the margins of the eye will not be inverted. This is an image of the two reeds; make them in this shape and this exact size in length and width.
Chapter Twelve.
On raising an inverted eyelash from the eye with a needle.
If it is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle and thread it with a fine, smooth silk thread, then bring the two ends together and tie them in a very delicate knot, and let the length of the thread be about a span.
Then attach another thin thread to the needle, shorter than the first, and tie its ends if you wish. Then let the patient place his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the work may be clearly seen, for it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the superfluous hair.
And pass it through the eyelid quickly until you bring it out above the natural hair, then pull the thread upwards on the needle and insert into the needle that hair, whether it be one, two or three, no more.
Then pull it with your hand until the hair comes out with the needle in the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you pull the needle and the hair does not come out with it, pull the needle downwards with the thread that you attached to it until the needle comes out from the upper opening.
Then return the hair into it and pull them both. Do this until it rises in the upper opening and you see it clearly. Then remove the needle and thread and take them out, and bind the eyelid and leave it bound for two or three days until the hair settles in its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add to it a long hair from the natural hair so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer, then raise it.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of the stye which occurs in the upper eyelid.
That which this stye is exposed to is called a harelip, and this stye is either natural or accidental. The accidental one is from the healing of a wound or a cut or cautery or the like.
And the way to treat it is to incise that adhesion and separate its lips and place between them a wick of linen and bind it until it heals, and it is not appropriate to use in its treatment things which dry and constrict.
For if you do that, the stye will return more severely than it was, but rather use in it things which relax, like fenugreek and lint with water in which althaea and flaxseed have been boiled, and diachylon ointment melted with some fats, and smear the wick with it and treat it with this.
And the aim of its treatment is to try by every means that it does not adhere in the way it was initially, and this treatment which we have mentioned is only some improvement of the stye, not that the appearance of the place returns completely to what it was.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the treatment of the stye which is in the lower eyelid.
This stye which forms in the lower eyelid is what is truly called a stye, and it is both natural and accidental.  The accidental one results from a wound, incision, cautery, or the like.
And the method of working in it is to take a needle with doubled thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left canthus to the right canthus until the thread is at both ends of the flesh, then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what is appropriate, otherwise, take a probe and place it on the site of the incision and turn the eyelid with it and make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the incisions are from the corners of the cut which you cut until they meet and form an angle from them. Until, when they meet, its shape becomes similar to this shape:
Which is the Greek letter lambda, then remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp side is lower than what is below the eyelid, then gather the separated parts with two sutures, sew it with a wool thread, then treat it with what we mentioned of softening and relaxing medications until it heals.
And if the fistula appeared from an incision, suture, or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision without the hair of the eyelids as well, as mentioned before, then separate the lips with a probe as we mentioned.
In short, in the treatment of a fistula, whether it is from above or below, you should work according to what is available to you from the appearance of the fistula, for it may differ greatly in appearance, and the skillful surgeon devises a solution in any way possible to him.
Until the shape returns to its natural form or approximates it, and the disease itself will indicate to you what treatment and instrument are suitable for it in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
This adhesion may occur to many people, such that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing it from easy movement and hindering its natural functions.  Then it is necessary to insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid.
And raise it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not with the sharpness of cutting scalpels, but rather slightly dull, lest the patient be disturbed during the procedure and the scalpel slips, injuring the eye with its sharpness; and your cutting should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed, then pour into the eye salt water to wash it, or instill into it some solution of vitriol dissolved in water, then separate the eyelid and the eye with a linen wick.
And place over the eye wool moistened with egg white, and after the third day use astringent eye drops until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cutting the pterygium and the fleshy excrescence of the conjunctiva.
The pterygium is of two kinds: either nervous, which resembles a firm, thin membrane, or non-nervous, which resembles a thick, white moisture; if touched with iron or attempted to be removed with a hook, it is torn.
And a hook does not hold in it. Both kinds begin from the greater canthus, until they gradually spread, until they cover the pupil and prevent light and the movement of the eye. The method of its removal is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes, and you raise the eyelid with your hand, then you grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and stretch it upwards, then you take a needle and thread it with a horsehair or oxhair and strong thread, and bend the point of the needle slightly and insert it into the middle of the pterygium.
And you pass it through with the needle and tie the pterygium with the thread and stretch it upwards and dissect with the hair the side of the pterygium which is towards the pupil, as if you are spreading it with the hair to its end, then you cut the remainder at the root of the canthus with a delicate scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the canthus.
Lest there should result from its cutting a constant flow of tears.  The pterygium may be stretched with the hook alone or with the thread as we said, then the smooth scalpel dissects the end, whose image is this:
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, lest it cause a tear in it and injure the pupil. Then, after cutting, put something of powdered salt or of vitriol into the eye and leave it until the next day, then treat it as appropriate until it heals.
If the pterygium is not fibrous and you are unable to insert a needle into it or fix a hook in it, this type of pterygium is often treated with medications and heals as described in the classification. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
And take a delicate, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, like this image: And dissect the pterygium from above gently with it. If you see that it is loosening and breaking up and the dissection has affected it, then instill into the eye from your instrument vitriol or red vitriol or powdered salt and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless a hot inflammation intervenes in the eye; then leave it and treat the hot inflammation until it heals, then resume the dissection until it heals. As for the fleshy excrescence of the meatus…
If the excrescence injures the eye excessively, then hook that excrescence with a hook and cut some of it, but do not overdo the cutting lest it cause a flow of tears, then instill into the meatus red vitriol or vitriol until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the excision of fleshy excrescences and what grows of excessive flesh in the eye.
In the eyes of some people, a red fleshy growth may develop, accumulating until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or overflows onto the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids may be everted, and it resembles the rose of the pomegranate.
The procedure is that the patient should place his head in your lap, then open his eyes, and you should pick up all that red flesh with hooks suitable for that purpose.
Or grasp it with forceps or tweezers, then cut the flesh bit by bit until you have removed all of it by cutting, and be careful of the eye lest you injure it during the procedure. Your cutting may be done either with the scalpel which we described in the excision of the pterygium, or with small scissors. Like those with which one plucks hairs, as their image will be shown in the chapter following this chapter.
When you have finished cutting and all the growth is gone, fill the eye with crushed salt, or instill into it some red vitriol or a similar caustic medicine, and apply externally to the eye a pledget of cotton with egg white to prevent hot inflammation.
If any of the growth remains, and the bleeding is excessive, and you fear hot inflammation, then leave the eye and treat it with what will calm the inflammation, then return to the procedure until it is healed.  And do likewise with any excess flesh which appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any eye weak by nature or by accident with iron instruments, and do not undertake any of these procedures until you see that the member is able to withstand such treatment.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the removal of pterygia from the eye.
Pterygia are red vessels which grow over the eye, hindering its function and weakening the eye over time.  First, you should observe: if the eye in which the pterygia are present is strong and has no other disease besides the pterygia,
then removal is performed as follows: you should have the patient place his head in your lap, then hook those vessels with one or two hooks, according to your skill.  The hooks should be gently curved, in this manner:
or there may be two double hooks in one piece, in this manner:
Then, gently remove those vessels with fine scissors, wiping away the blood from time to time until you see that those vessels have been removed from the eye and the bleeding has stopped.  Be careful not to injure the eye with the points of the scissors, and let your work be done at midday facing the sun.
Be very careful in your work, lest you cut anything other than those vessels. When you have finished, instill green or red vitriol into the eye to cauterize what remains of the pterygium.  If you cannot remove it all at that time, bandage the eye with something that will soothe the pain.
Leave it for several days until the pain subsides and the inflammation ceases, then repeat the procedure in the same manner until it heals. This is the image of the appropriate scissors.
Leave it [and let the patient's head rest on the pupil's lap, while another wipes away the tears and examines the front and back of the eye.  And you] should, in principle, open the eye with fixed or triangular speculums held by a pupil.
Sharp, and let the patient's head rest on the pupil's lap, while another wipes away the tears and examines the front and back of the eye.  And you may choose whether to begin removing it from the top or bottom of the eye; it is preferable to sever two filaments on the upper side, one at the end of the cornea and the other at its beginning.
Grasp it between the middle and index fingers, then hook it from below opposite them; then grasp it between the little and ring fingers, and lift your hand gently until you see that the entire pterygium has been elevated. Cut it from the smallest side if you wish, with scissors, or if you wish, with a delicate scalpel.
And insert the thread onto a needle and dissect the entire pterygium until it is elevated above the conjunctiva. Do not cut the filament, for the tears and blood will obscure your vision.
Then cut with scissors what extends beyond the cornea from above and below, so that nothing remains attached except to the cornea. If you can elevate it from the cornea by dissection with the thread, that is best; and this may be possible in some people.
And if you cut it, let its site heal for several days, until the pain subsides and the inflammation abates, then resume the procedure.
Chapter Nineteen.
On replacing the nose.
Physicians call a fistula, when treating it with cautery or with the sharp, burning medicine previously described, and it does not heal, there is no recourse but to incise the swelling when it is ripe and evacuate all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, remove it with an instrument of this shape:
The rough head, so-called, is made of Indian iron and its head is round like a button, finely engraved with the pattern of a file or rasp. You place it on the affected part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, while applying slight pressure with your hand, until you know that the corruption has been removed.
Do this several times, then dress the wound with drying, astringent medicines. If the wound closes and the flesh grows over it and the discharge ceases, and forty days pass without recurrence, inflammation, or further incident,
know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no recourse but to return the fistula to the nasal cavity in this manner:  Expose the bone again with an iron instrument or a sharp medicine. When the bone is exposed, take a probe of this shape:
The tip of the instrument is triangular, and its shaft is conical, tapering to the point, as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the ethmoid bone and slightly away from the eye. Then, rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
by feeling air escaping from it when he holds his hand over his nose. Then dress the wound with the astringent, drying medicines as I have taught you. When the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter that used to flow outward will return to the nose, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In returning the protrusion of the eye.
If the eye protrudes completely, and no harm or deficiency occurs in the sight, then you should ease the patient, then bleed him in the cephalic vein, then place a cupping glass on the nape of the neck without restriction, and gently suck.
Then apply a poultice made of acacia, aloe, frankincense, and alkanet to the eye. Then bind the eye from above to the compress with many small bandages. The method of making the small bandages is to take many soft, burnt cloths and fold each cloth into four layers, making many of them.
Then place them one on top of the other, as much as the eye needs, then bind them tightly with a strong cloth, and repeat the cupping with suction without restriction. Then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, it should be tightened well. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, then do nothing. Otherwise, repeat the poultice, bandages, tightening, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On cutting the uvula.
If a hernia occurs in the uvula layer, then it protrudes and emerges outside the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance is disfigured because of it, and you want to cut it, then the procedure is as I describe.
It is to insert a needle into the base of the uvula from below upwards, then insert another needle with doubled thread from the side of the nape of the neck and pass it through, leaving the first needle as it is.
Then cut the doubled thread where it bends and tie some of the uvula around the needle, and pull it gently, then remove the needle and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white and leave it until the threads fall out with the uvula, then treat the eye with whatever strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  You may also pull the uvula from every direction with a circle of cloth until the eye protrudes gently, then incise with a thin scalpel reaching to the depth of the eye so that the white moisture flows out, and the eye descends and shrinks in place, then pull it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
In the treatment of uvulitis.
This ailment, called uvulitis, is a moisture that gathers in the eye resembling descending water, but it is not. The method of treatment is that you seat the patient on a chair upright, then take his head in your hands from both sides.
And move it until you see the moisture descend to the lower part with your eye, then it stabilizes and does not move, and the light emerges, and the patient sees things as he used to see them. And if it does not descend to the lower part, we know that it is water. If the descent of the moisture is not achieved by what we mentioned,
otherwise, seat the patient before you, then take a thin scalpel and incise with it slightly above the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the limbus until the material comes out.
When it comes out, instill in the eye warm water in which honey has been mixed, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have mentioned the types of water in the classification and which of them is suitable for cupping, with a detailed and explained statement, so take it from there correctly. Then you should seat the patient before you, sitting squarely facing the light near the sun.
And you bind his healthy eye and tie it tightly, then you lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye with the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the cupping instrument near the cornea, with the thickness of a probe, in the same white of the eye on the side of the smaller caruncle, then you push the cupping instrument forcefully while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the cupping instrument that it has reached something empty.
And it should be that the extent to which the cupping instrument goes into the depth is the extent of the distance from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the cornea, for the copper is seen in the same vision of the observer, by the clarity of the corneal membrane, then you move the cupping instrument upwards to the place where the water is.
Then you press it downwards again and again; if the water descends immediately, then the patient will see what his sight has opened to immediately, with the cupping instrument in his eye, then it settles a little; if the water rises, then lower it again without removing the cupping instrument.
If it settles and does not rise, then remove the cupping instrument gently while twisting it with your hand little by little, then dissolve in the water some pure Andarani salt and wash the eye with it from the inside, then apply to the outside of the whole eye a compress or wet wool.
With rose oil and egg white, and bind with it the healthy eye; but as for us and the people of our time, we place on it crushed cumin with egg white. If the cupping instrument does not enter the eye because of its hardness—for some people have very hard eyes— Then you should take the scalpel called the *barīd*, whose image is this:
Then pierce with it only the adherent part and do not exaggerate in the piercing; it is only that you make a delicate place for the cupping instrument, then insert the cupping instrument as we mentioned. When your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm bed in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room.
And he should abstain from all movements and from coughing, and make his food whatever softens his constitution, and he should not move his head to the right or left at all. The bandage should remain in place until the third day, then untie it in that dark room and test his sight.
Show him things, then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.  It is not appropriate to do this during treatment or after cupping at your hour, but you should avoid it before, lest the water quickly ascend with intense looking.
If a hot swelling appears, then you should untie the eye before the seventh day and treat that with whatever calms the swelling, until when it subsides, then you release his sight and place a veil on his face that trains his sight from under it for some days while he is in that dark room, then...
He leaves the house gradually and manages his causes. And know that the learner cannot dispense with observation many times in cupping, then he proceeds to work. And it has reached me from some Iraqis that he mentioned that he makes in Iraq a cupping instrument that is perforated, by which he sucks out the water.
And I have not seen anyone in our country make that, nor read it in any book of the ancients. It may be that it is recent.  And this is an image of types of cupping instruments for the ignorant to stand upon:
It is made of copper, especially, and its tip is of this very thinness, triangular-tipped and sharp.
Chapter twenty-four.
In the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Various kinds of superfluous flesh may grow in the nose; some resembling a scorpion with many legs, some cancerous flesh, hardened and dark in color, and some soft flesh, not dark in color.
If any of this flesh is soft, not malignant nor cancerous, then the patient should sit before you facing the sun, you should open his nostril, and insert the snare into that flesh, then draw it outwards, and then cut what you have grasped of it with a fine, sharp scalpel on one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone. If any remains that you could not cut, remove it gently with one of the fine instruments, so that nothing remains. If the bleeding is excessive or a hot swelling appears,
treat it accordingly. If it is one of the malignant tumors, act quickly to excise it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone. Then place vinegar and water or a drink in the nose after the cutting, if the nose opens and moisture passes from it to the throat.
Know that he is healed. If the moisture does not flow as it should, know that inside there is flesh growing on the weakened bones which the instrument did not reach with the cutting. Then you should take a moderately thick linen thread.
and tie many knots in it, making the space between each knot the width of a finger or less. The patient should skillfully insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or whatever is possible after making it like a button, and draw it through until it reaches the pharynx.
and it will come out through his throat. Children in school often do this, and it is easy for anyone who wants to. Then bring together the two ends of the thread, the one that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to saw the flesh, doing so until you know that the flesh has been severed by the knots of the thread. Then remove the thread and put in the nose, after wiping away the blood, a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more.
until the ointment consumes all the remaining flesh. Then, as a final step, place a lead tube in the nose for several days until it heals. If it needs drying treatment, use that.
This is an image of the instrument with which oils and medications are dropped into the nose:
It is made of silver or copper, resembling a small, open, oiled candlestick, and its channel is likewise.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the surface of the instrument flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when you heat oil or whatever you wish of juices or flowing substances in it.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
Concerning warts growing on the tip of the nose.
A wart often grows on the tip of the nose, and it increases and grows larger with the days until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and to excise it completely, then apply to the place either cautery or a burning medicine which takes the place of cautery. If you fail to cut it off until it becomes large, then look: if it is hardened, solid, dark in color, and insensitive,
do not use the iron on it, for it is a cancerous tumor; and I have often seen that cutting this tumor resulted in a great calamity for its owner. But if the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that it can be completely cut, then let the patient empty his bowels and cut it without hesitation or delay, and treat the place with what dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If their connection is separated by a wound or something similar, know that when a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, the treatment rarely works except in some people.
Then, if something like that happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with its blood; gather the edges of the wound with sutures, then treat it until it heals. And if the separation of the connection has separated its edges and each part has become sound, then you should scrape each part to the thickness of its outer skin until it bleeds.
Then gather the edges with sutures and tighten them, and sprinkle on them mastic and frankincense, powdered, and place on top of the sutures a plaster of palm-tree ointment or another of the uniting ointments, and leave it bandaged for two or three days, then untie it.
And change the medication and leave it until the threads separate themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The method of suturing is to bring together the separated connection, either with needles as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread as I showed you there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On removing the knots which appear in the lips.
Many people develop small, hard tumors inside their lips; some resemble a carbuncle, others are smaller or larger. You should evert the lip and incise over each nodule and extract it with a hook.
And cut it from each side, then pack the area after cutting with powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the area with something astringent until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cutting away excess gum.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called epulis. You should hook it with a hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its base, and let the blood flow, then apply powdered alum to the area.
Or one of the astringent, drying powders. If that flesh returns after treatment—for it often does return—cut it again and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On extracting teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly crusts may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums.  These may become black, yellow, or green, even causing damage to the gums and making the teeth unsightly.
You should seat the patient before you, his head in your lap, and clean the tooth or teeth where you see crusts and things resembling sand until nothing remains.  Do the same with blackness, greenness, yellowness, and anything else until you have cleansed them.
If the substance is removed by the first cleaning, good. Otherwise, repeat the cleaning on another day, and then a second and third time, until you achieve your goal. Know that a molar requires many different types of instruments, various shapes, according to what suits your work.
For the instrument used to clean a molar from the inside is not the same as that used to clean it from the outside, nor that used to clean between the molars, which is of another form.  These are several forms of instruments that you should have, all prepared.
Chapter Thirty.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
You should treat the molar for its pain by every means, and delay its extraction, for there is no replacement if it is extracted, because it is a noble substance, except when its extraction is unavoidable.
If the patient decides on its extraction, you should make sure that the aching tooth is correctly identified. For often the patient is deceived by the pain and thinks it is in the healthy tooth, and extracts it, then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted.  We have seen this done repeatedly by barbers.
Then, if you have correctly identified the aching tooth, you should then incise around the tooth with a strong scalpel to loosen the gum on all sides, then move it slightly with your fingers or with gentle forceps, little by little, until you loosen it.
Then, firmly grasp it with the large forceps, and hold the patient's head between your knees so that it is steady and does not move. Then pull the tooth straight out, so as not to break it. If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it gently under it from each side, and try moving it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill the hole with a piece of cloth and pack it tightly with the end of a thin probe, so that it does not crumble when you pull it with the forceps. You should also thoroughly incise around the gum on every side.
And take care not to break it, for if some of it remains, it will cause the patient greater harm than his initial pain. And beware of doing what the ignorant barbers do, in their haste and recklessness in extracting it without using what we have described.
For they often inflict great harm on people, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and all or part of its roots remain. Or it may extract some of the jawbone, as we have often witnessed. Then, after extraction, rinse with a drink or vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs at the site—and this often happens—then crush some alum and pack it into the site.
Otherwise, cauterize it if the alum does not help you. The image of the delicate forceps with which you first move the tooth: they should have long ends, short handles and be thick, so that they do not bend when you grasp the tooth with them. And this is the image of the large forceps.
As you see, they have thick handles so that when you grasp them, they do not yield or bend; they have short ends, and are made of Indian iron or well-tempered steel, with sharpened ends, and teeth at the tip which interlock, so that they grip firmly and tightly.
The ends may also be made in the shape of a file, and will then also be strong in their grip.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On extracting the roots of molars and removing fractured jaw bones.
If, when extracting a tooth, a root remains broken off, you should place cotton soaked in butter on the area for a day or two until the area relaxes, then insert a hook or forceps. whose ends resemble the beak of the bird called the balargah.  This is an image of the forceps:
They should be made like a file on the inside, or like a scalpel. If you are unable to remove it with these forceps, you should excavate the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert an instrument resembling a small lever, which is depicted here:
short and slightly thick at the end, and not pointed, lest it break. If the root is removed by this, well and good; otherwise, use these other instruments, which are depicted here: the first has a triangular end and is somewhat thick.
Another fine triangular image:
We may also use this instrument with two branches, which is also depicted here:
and other instruments and tools previously mentioned in the extraction of teeth. We may also use this instrument which resembles a large hook, which is depicted here:
triangular, with a curved end, slightly thick so that it does not break, and not pointed. And know that the instruments for teeth are numerous, and so are all the other instruments; they are almost innumerable, and the skillful and expert craftsman may invent for himself instruments according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate to him.
For there are diseases for which the ancients did not mention instruments, due to the variety of their types.  If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decays, then investigate its condition in its place with one of these instruments and forceps which were mentioned in the extraction of roots.
And we use a curette, its image is this:
It should be somewhat thick to control the bone so that it does not escape until the bone comes out, and we treat the area with suitable medications. If the bone has a slight decay, then remove its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
Concerning the extraction of molars growing upon others.
If molars grow other than in their natural course, this is an unsightly appearance, especially if it occurs in women and slaves.  It should be examined; if the molar has grown behind another tooth,
and its extraction or pushing back is not possible, then extract it.  And if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose image is this:
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian iron, very sharp at the tip.  Your cutting should be done over many days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not shake other teeth. But if it is prominent and firmly rooted, then file it down with an Indian file; its image is this.
It should be entirely of Indian [steel], and its point should be very finely engraved, like the file with which needles are made.  File the tooth down little by little over many days gently, so that you do not shake the tooth and cause it to fall out.  Then smooth it and remove it with some forceps.
And if a tooth is broken, and it hurts the tongue when speaking, then it should also be filed until the roughness of the break is removed, and it is smooth and even, and does not hurt the tongue nor impair speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On binding loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loose and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything to eat for fear that they will fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines but the treatment has not been effective.
The solution is to bind them with a gold or silver thread, gold being preferable because silver tarnishes and decays after a few days, whereas gold remains unchanged forever and is not subject to this. The thread should be of moderate thinness and thickness, according to what fits between the teeth.
The method of binding is to take the thread and insert its loop between the healthy teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach a healthy tooth on the other side by weaving.
Then you return the weaving to the side where you began and pull gently and skillfully so that they do not move at all.  Your pulling of the thread should be at the roots of the teeth lest it come loose. Then you cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them together, twist them with a small instrument, and hide them between the healthy and the loose tooth.
So that it does not injure the tongue. Then leave it thus tightened for as long as it remains. If it becomes loose or breaks, tighten it with another thread, and he will enjoy it thus his whole life. And this is an image of the teeth and the manner of the binding in two healthy teeth and two loose teeth as you see.
And it may be that one or two teeth, after falling out, are returned to their place and bound as we have described, and remain. This is done by a skilled dentist. He may also carve a piece of ox bone and shape it like a tooth and place it in the place from which the tooth has gone. And he tightens it as we said, and it remains, and he enjoys it.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
Concerning the cutting of the ligament which appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament which appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound which has healed.
And the procedure is that you open the mouth of the patient and place his head in your lap and raise his tongue, then cut that nervous ligament transversely until the tongue is released from its restraint. If there is some stiffness and complexity, and this is from the healing of a wound, then place a hook in it and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots are undone.
And beware that the incision is not deep in the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding results. Then, let him rinse his mouth after the cutting with rose water or with vinegar and cold water, then place under the tongue a pledget of linen which the patient holds in place each night.
Lest it reunite. If bleeding occurs, place powdered alum on the place. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the place with a lentil-shaped cautery suitable for this. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-five.
In removing a frog that has formed under the tongue.
A swelling resembling a small frog sometimes occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and it may even grow large enough to fill the mouth. The procedure is to open the patient's mouth towards the sun and examine the swelling.
If you see it dark-colored or black and hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, do not interfere with it, for it is cancer. But if it is inclined to white and moist, pierce it with a probe and incise it with a fine scalpel, freeing it from every side.
If blood overwhelms you during your work, apply powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then resume your work until you have completely removed it. Then have the patient rinse the mouth with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with other appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
In the treatment of tonsil tumors.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors.  Glands may appear inside the throat resembling those that appear externally, called tonsils. If you treat them with what I mentioned in the section and they do not heal,
then look: if the tumor is hard, dark in color, and insensitive, do not approach it with iron. And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not approach it with iron either, for fear of bleeding, but leave it until it matures, for either you will lance it or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut.  The procedure is that you should look before operating whether its hot swelling has completely subsided or diminished somewhat.
Then seat the patient facing the sun, his head in your lap, and open his mouth. Take an assistant, and he will press down his tongue with an instrument of this form:
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you press the tongue with it and the tumor is revealed to you and you see it, take a hook and pierce it into the tonsil and pull it outward as much as possible without pulling along any of the membranes.
Then cut it with an instrument of this form, resembling scissors except that its ends are curved, each end being very sharp, next to the other. It is made of Indian iron or Damascene steel:
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel of this form:
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After you cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner. Then, after cutting, gargle the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peel or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops. Then treat him until he recovers. Other tumors besides the tonsils may grow in the throat; cut them as I have described for the tonsils.
I treated a woman who had a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a polyp, somewhat insensitive, which almost blocked her throat. The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and was prevented from eating and drinking water.
She was on the verge of death if she had remained for a day or two. Two branches extended from the tumor, emerging from her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserted a hook into one of them, and pulled; a suitable piece was extracted.
Then I cut it where I reached it through the nostril.  Then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut some of it; only a little blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately began to drink water, then she ate. We repeatedly cut away parts of the tumor over a long time; the tumor repeatedly replaced what was cut, until this went on for a long time for both of us.
Then I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside the throat with a cautery; it stopped growing. Then she traveled away, and I do not know what God did with her afterwards.
Chapter thirty-seven.
On cutting a uvular tumor.
That which is called an `anaba` if it descends as a growth to the uvula and swells and is white and elongated; if it is thicker at the bottom and round, it is called an `anaba`. If it is treated with what we mentioned in the section and the treatment is not effective,
and you see that the hot tumor has subsided from it and it is thin, then it should be cut, and whatever is gathered and round and does not have length, and is bloody or the color of a boil, or black, or insensitive, then it should be avoided cutting.
For there is danger to the patient. Therefore, if you see it in the manner I described, of its whiteness and length, then seat the patient facing the sun and compress his tongue with the instrument whose description precedes, then pierce the `anaba` with the hook.
And pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in cutting the tonsils. And it should not be cut except that which exceeds the natural state without excess, for if you cut more of it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after cutting, use what we described in cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is afraid of cutting it, then it is necessary to use a method of cauterizing it without fear or caution. The way to cauterize it is with a sharp medicine, and that is to place the patient's head in your lap.
Then compress his tongue with the instrument we mentioned, then take some of the sharp water which I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with unquenched lime, and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument with it.  And this is its image:
Its end, in which you place the medicine, has a concavity like the concavity of a spoon, and you place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, and the patient lying on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat, lest anything descend from it into his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine while you squeeze it on the uvula for about half an hour until you see it has blackened and the sting of the medicine has subsided. And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe and wet the cotton in the medicine.
And insert the probe with the cotton into the tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula, then leave it. It will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it.
After cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter and use it to dry the medicine around it, then rinse with cold water, and treat from the outside with lotions and from the inside with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and further from fear.
The uvula may also be treated with something gentler than cauterization and cutting; it is treated with fumigation in this manner: take fumitory, hyssop, savory, rue, wormwood, chamomile, and cassia, and similar herbs. Gather them all, or some of them, in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
Boil them, with the pot plastered with potter's clay, and there should be a hole in the middle of the lid into which a hollow instrument is fitted; this is made of silver or copper.
Insert the end with the rose head into the patient's mouth until the steam rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is well steamed. Then repeat several times until it withers. And do not perform this treatment at the first onset of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling.  Rather, it should be done when the hot swelling subsides. If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit an eggshell to the end so that the patient's mouth does not burn.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment and safe.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On removing thorns and other things that lodge in the throat.
Often a bone, fishbone, or something else lodges in the throat.  It is necessary to remove what is visible to the eye, after compressing the tongue with the instrument, towards the sun.
So that you may discern what is in the throat.  And as for what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to induce vomiting in the patient before his food is digested in his stomach, for perhaps the lodged object will come out with the vomit; or the patient may swallow a piece of turnip or a root of lettuce.
Or he may swallow a piece of dry bread, or you may take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a string, and then he swallows it; and when it reaches the place of the thorn, pull the string quickly; do this repeatedly.
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and be removed. If it does not come out by what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument of this shape:
It should be slightly thicker than an awl, and at its tip a hook. The patient inserts it gently into his throat, raising his head upwards, and taking care not to touch his larynx lest he cause coughing and push the bone or thorn; or the physician inserts it with his hand.
And it is better for the patient to insert it himself, for he knows the location of the lodged object, and pushes downwards or pulls upwards with the instrument, all this as he is able, until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If you treat the leech with what we mentioned in the section on medicinal treatment and it does not work, then look into the patient's throat in the sunlight after you have depressed his tongue with the instrument which I described to you.
If you see the leech, then draw it out with a small hook or with a fine, firm probe.  If you cannot manage it otherwise, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert into the hollow of the tube a piece of iron heated in the fire.
Do this repeatedly, and the patient should abstain from water all that day. Then he should take a jug full of cold water and open his mouth into it and rinse his mouth with it, but should not swallow a drop, and move the water from time to time with his hand.
For the leech will fall away if it feels the water. If it does not come out as described, fumigate the throat with urine and with asafoetida with the instrument which I described in the fumigation of the tonsils; do this repeatedly, for it will fall out.
The method of fumigation is that you take a pot containing live coals heated in the fire, the pot being covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole. You fit into that hole the end of the instrument, then you throw in the fumigant. The patient puts his mouth to the end of the tube and closes his mouth so that the fumigant does not escape, until he knows that the fumigant has reached his throat.
Then the leech will fall away. If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation. The patient should endure thirst and eat salt and garlic and drink no water; then it must come out by this method. And this is the image of an instrument by which the leech is drawn from the throat if it is seen.
It resembles forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve which enters the throat, and its ends resemble the beak of a bird; they have the roughness of a file, so if they grip something, they do not let go.
And another instrument, with which the tongue is compressed; it is a wide ring of iron, as large as will fit in the mouth above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, so the mouth remains open without the will of the patient, and he cannot remove it at all until it is taken away.
The description of the instrument with which the mouth is opened in this very way.
Chapter Forty.
Herein is made mention of the cauterization and incision of tumors.
Tumors are of many kinds and varied, according to what will be mentioned one by one in this book, and they differ in their cauterization and incision in two aspects: one, from the type of tumor itself and what it contains of humors.
And the second type is from the locations in which they occur in the body, for a tumor occurring in the head is not like a tumor occurring in the rectum, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy location is not like a tumor occurring in a joint; for each of them there is a ruling on treatment.
And of tumors, there are some that should not be cauterized except after the ripening and completion of the pus within them, and some that should be cauterized while they are raw and have not completely ripened, such as tumors that are close to the joints.
For if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition persists until it corrupts what is around it, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, and thus become a cause of the crippling of that limb, or the tumor may be near a principal organ.
Because if you delay its cauterization until it ripens, you will harm that principal organ; or it may be near the rectum, so cauterize it raw.  It is necessary to cauterize a raw tumor, not completely ripened, which is near the rectum, lest it corrupt the depth and penetrate into the interior of the rectum, and become a fistula.
And it becomes to a degree that it will not heal.  And you should know the time for cauterizing tumors that have completely ripened, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and throbbing decrease, and the head of the tumor becomes pitted and all other signs appear.
And it is preferable to perform the cauterization in the lowest part of the tumor, if that is possible, so that the flow of pus may be easier downwards; or in the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor. Let the cauterization be lengthwise if the tumors are in the hands or feet.
And the locations of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries; in short, in all flat locations that do not bend.  But those that bend, let the cauterization follow the shape of that location.  But if the tumor is in fleshy locations, it is best to leave it uncauterized.
Until its ripening is complete, as we have said; for if you cauterize it before that, the flow of pus from it will be prolonged, and it will be very harmful and dirty, and perhaps its lips and depth will harden.  And some tumors may be cauterized across the body, when necessary, or according to the needs of the member.
And it is necessary to use a single cauterization for small tumors, and for large tumors, a wide cauterization or many incisions, according to the size of the tumor.  There may be some tumors that it is necessary to shave the skin and cut it, if it has become like a rag.
And it has reached a point where it has died, like what happens in many boils and abscesses.  And some of them are incised with a three-sided incision, and some of them are cut in the shape of an ivy leaf, like the inguinal tumor.
And some of them use a circular incision and a crescent-shaped incision and similar incisions.  And what does not have a head, like smooth, flat tumors, it is necessary to cauterize it with a simple cauterization only. And it is necessary, if the tumor is large and has gathered for a long time and you cauterize it, not to rush so that all the pus comes out at that time.
But remove some of it, then dress the tumor until another day, then remove some of the pus also.  Do this repeatedly gradually until you remove all of it.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man, for the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden exit of the pus, and perhaps the patient dies and you do not realize it. Therefore, beware of this matter with great caution.
After cauterizing these tumors, it is necessary to wipe the wound and look. If the wound of the tumor is small or the incision is one and simple, then use lint from linen or old cotton. And if the tumor is large and the incisions of the cauterization are many,
it is necessary to insert into each incision a tent so that some of them reach each other. And if some of the skin of the tumor has been cut or scraped, it is necessary to pack it with old cotton or linen lint without moisture and dress it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar after you soak a linen cloth in them and apply it to the bleeding site repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, it is necessary to use the procedures, treatment, and styptics that we have described in many places in this book and in the division. If you are in winter and the location of the tumor is very sensitive, it is necessary to wet the bandages with warm wine and oil.
And place them on the site. And if you are in summer and the sites are fleshy, it is necessary to apply the bandages soaked in water and oil or in wine and oil, all of it cold, until the third day, as we said. Then it is necessary to unwrap the tumor and wipe it.
And use something similar in its treatment until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the detailed method, I have mentioned how to treat each tumor, categorized and summarized.
Chapter forty-one.
Concerning the incision of tumors that appear in the scalp.
Small tumors appear in the scalp; they are a type of boil, contained within membranes, and they have conditions like a chicken’s crop.  Their types are many; some are fatty, and some contain a moisture resembling mud.
And some contain a moisture resembling pus and broth and the like, and some are hardened and solid.  All of them are not dangerous to incise and remove, unless a vein obstructs you during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument whose image comes after this, which is called the “muddass,” until you know what it contains. If what it contains is moisture, then incise it lengthwise with a simple incision in this manner:
Begin the incision from point B to point C.  When the moisture has emptied, then peel away the sac that contained that moisture and cut it all away, and do not leave any of it at all, for it often recurs if any of it remains.
Then dip cotton in the “marham surri” if it is present, otherwise in salt water, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day, for it will consume what remains of the sac. Then apply the cotton with the “surri” again, a second and third time if needed.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. And if the swelling contains fatty material, then incise it in this manner:
With a firm incision, and place hooks in the lips of the wound and peel it from every side, and exert yourself in removing the peritoneum that contains it. If an artery obstructs you, then do as I described to you before, and similarly do in the swelling if it is hardened from the incision.
And the treatment is the same as I mentioned, and the incision on the hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture. And it may be that some of these swellings which are in the head in some people have no moisture with them at all, and that is because I incised a swelling in…
The head of an old woman, and I found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if someone threw it, it would cut him. And it was not like other swellings occurring in the head, except for these, like the swellings which appear in the heads of children.
And at the roots of the ears, then incise them all with a simple incision, and make their bottom from their lower parts so that the flow of the material is easier to the bottom, then treat them with what suits them of treatment.
Chapter forty-two.
Concerning the incision on the swellings which frequently appear in the neck. These swellings frequently appear in the neck and under the armpits and in the groins, and they may appear in the rest of the body. And that which appears in the neck of them may be one, or it may be many, and some of them develop from others.
And every swelling of them is within a special membrane, as is the case in the abscesses and swellings of the head as we have described. And the types of these swellings are many; some of them are calcified, and some of them contain fluids, and some of them are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
So what I saw of them in good condition to the touch, and their appearance was close to the color of the skin, moving to every direction, and it was not adhering to a nerve of the neck, nor to a vein, nor to an artery, nor was it deep-seated. Then it should be incised with a simple incision from above to below the body, in this manner, from line J to line B.
And it should be dissected from every side, and the lips of the skin should be stretched with a hook or with two hooks, or with many hooks if that is needed, as we said in the swellings of the head, and it should be removed little by little, and it should be on the neck so that a vein or nerve is not cut, and let the scalpel not be very sharp.
Lest your hand increase the cutting, or the patient is disturbed, and you cut what you do not need to cut.  If you cut a vein or an artery and it hinders you from work, then place in the wound powdered verdigris or some of the styptics which stop blood.
And tighten the wound and leave it until the intensity of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to suppurate, for the bleeding then stops.  Then return to your work until you finish, then examine with your index finger if there remain other small worms, then cut them and clean them.
If in the root of the worm there is a large vein, then it should not be cut from its root, but it should be tied with a doubled, tight thread and left until it falls off by itself without harm. Then stuff the wound with old cotton which has been soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the whole worm, then you should bring together the lips of the wound and stitch it immediately after you know that no particle remains. If you see that a particle of the bone of the worm remains,
then you should aim at cutting to its root and base, and use stitching and what we have mentioned. And as for worms which contain fluids, lightly cauterize them where their ripeness appears, and make the cautery from below, as we have said.
Then after cauterization, use a dressing with Egyptian ointment or the like to consume what remains of the corruption, until when you see that the wound has been cleansed, treat it with ointments which generate flesh until it heals.
Chapter forty-three.
Concerning the incision of the throat for a tumor which occurs inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is the account of their words. As for those with angina, they should avoid incision of the throat, since they do not benefit from it.
Because all the veins and the lung become diseased, but those with a hot tumor in the mouth, or throat, or tonsils, if there is no illness in the trachea, then it is necessary to use incision of the throat to escape the harm which results from suffocation.
Therefore, if we wish to do this, we should incise the throat below three or four rings of the trachea, a small transverse incision between two rings, to the extent that the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage. This location is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it. If the surgeon is cowardly, then he should extend the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until he reaches the trachea, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should incise the membrane which we have described.  One can determine the incision of the trachea from the phlegm which comes out of it, along with whatever is punctured, and from the cessation of sound. The wound is left open for a time. When the time during which strangulation was feared has passed, the edges of the wound are brought together from the skin.
And its outline alone, without the cartilage. Then use medicines which cause the growth of flesh until it heals. The author of this book said, the explanation of all this speech which we have related is only if they see that the patient's throat is obstructed by one of these tumors which have been mentioned.
And the patient is near death and his life is about to end, they proceed to incise the throat so that the patient may breathe somewhat through the wound and be saved from death. They are ordered to leave the wound open until the severity of the disease subsides, and its severity is about three days or so.
Then they are ordered to suture the wound and treat it until it heals. What I witnessed myself is that a maidservant took a knife and ran it across her throat, cutting part of her windpipe. I was called to treat her, and I found her weakening as one who is slaughtered weakens.  I uncovered the wound.
I found the blood which came out of the wound to be slight, and I was certain that she had not cut a vein nor an artery, and air was coming out of the wound. So I proceeded, and I sutured the wound and treated it until it healed. Nothing happened to the maidservant except for hoarseness in the voice, no more.
And after days she returned to her best condition. From this, we say that incising the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter forty-four.
Concerning the incision on the tumor which appears in the throat from the outside and is called the throat's elephantiasis.
This tumor which is called the throat's elephantiasis is a large tumor of the color of the body. It is frequent in women and is of two types.
It is either natural or accidental. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it; as for the accidental, it is of two kinds: one resembling fatty swellings, and the other resembling the tumor which arises from the complication of the artery; and there is danger in incising it. Therefore, one should never use the iron on it unless it is small; if you probe and examine it with a probe and find that it resembles a fatty swelling and is not connected to anything from the vessels, then incise it as you incise fatty swellings. And remove it with whatever contains it from the sac, if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove all of it completely, then treat the place with what is necessary of treatment.
Chapter forty-five.
Concerning the incision of various swellings.
Swellings are numerous in types, and I have mentioned all their types in the classification.  It is necessary to explain here the difference between a swelling and an abscess, since it is difficult.  So I say that with an abscess there is heat and fever and frightening pains until the boiling of the matter subsides. And the putrefaction is completed; then the fever and intensity subside.  A swelling, however, has neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it is contained in a serous sac, which is a special covering for it. It is the color of the body and its beginning is like a small boil, and it becomes like a blister, larger or smaller.
And it is of two kinds: either fatty, or containing moisture. The colors of the moisture are numerous, as I mentioned in the classification.  Therefore, if you proceed to the treatment of a swelling, you should probe and examine it first with the instrument called the *muddass*, whose image is given in the chapter following this.
Assess the size of the swelling, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If a flowing moisture of any color comes out, then incise it with a simple incision as I have mentioned in the case of other swellings. If no moisture comes out after the probe, then know that it is fatty.
Then make a firm incision on it in this manner as I have taught you, and hook it with hooks.  Peel the skin from every side gently, and preserve the sac if you can, so that you may remove it intact with the swelling.
If the sac is ruptured during the operation and you cannot remove it intact—and this often happens—then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it. For if any part of it, however small or large, remains, the swelling will usually return.
If it overcomes you and a little remains, cauterize the wound at its completion with some sharp corrosive caustics, and tighten the wound and place over it something that soothes hot swelling and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If the swelling is large, then suture its lips and treat it with that which heals.
If you encounter a bleeding or non-bleeding vein and bleeding occurs, immediately cauterize the area with powdered vitriol and leave it constricted for two or three days until the wound suppurates and the flow of blood stops. Then return to removing what remains of the swelling.
Chapter Forty-six.
On the forms of instruments.
Those which are used in incision and cauterization; among the forms of probes are three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are made of iron or steel, square-ended and firm, to facilitate entry into tumors.  These are images of probes, also called borers, and there are also three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe:
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
Suitable for exploring tumors, wounds, fistulas, and abscesses, to discover what is inside them, such as bone and so on. They are made round, polished, and smooth like spatulas, from Chinese copper, or from Spanish copper, or from copper, or from iron, or from silver; the best are those made from Spanish copper.
Probes can also be made of lead, and are suitable for exploring fistulas which have a curve in their depth, for their softness allows them to bend with that curve.  These also come in three types: long, medium, and short.
According to the depth needed for each fistula, and its thickness is made according to the width and narrowness of the fistula. Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks; they are of many types, for some are simple, meaning those with one hook, and these are of three types: large, medium, and small.  There are also the blind hooks, which are of three types, and those with two hooks, which are of three types, and the curved hooks with two hooks. They are of three types.  And there are hooks with three hooks, which are of three types.  And all of these types, each one is needed in its place. Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.
Image of a large blind hook. Image of a medium blind hook.
Image of a small blind hook.
Image of a large hook with two hooks. Image of a medium hook with two hooks. Image of a small hook with two hooks.
Image of a large hook with three hooks.
Image of a medium hook with three hooks. Image of a small hook with three hooks.
And these are the images of the scalpels with which one cuts and excises the sores and tumors. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its blades, with which it cuts, are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp, but rather made thus so that one may use them in flaying the sore when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may feel some ease from the burning which he feels when the tumor is flayed.
And these are the images of the probes. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large probe.
It is made of copper, similar to the probe with which one applies kohl, and at one end is something like a wide spoon of two layers, which has in its head a hidden scalpel blade resembling a bird's tongue, which moves in and out as desired, as you see.
Images of the scalpels which are inserted between the fingers when lancing tumors, without the patient feeling them.  They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Images of the cupping instruments with which blood is drawn. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of the large cupping instrument.
They are made of copper or china, slightly elongated as you see, and thin.  It is necessary that you have these types of cupping instruments, large and small, to draw blood quickly when necessary and when you do not have medicine at hand.
But they are not used to draw blood from every part of the body, but rather they are used in fleshy parts such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the muscles of the arm, the breast, the abdomen, the groin, and similar moist fleshy parts.
And other small instruments may be made from them, resembling pistachio shells, in this manner:
Blood is drawn with them if it flows from a place of phlebotomy or when a vein or artery is cut.  And they may be made round in this manner:
Chapter forty-seven.
On the treatment of men's breasts.
The breasts of some people may swell at the age of puberty until they resemble women's breasts, remaining swollen and unsightly.  Whoever dislikes this should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this manner.
From line B to line C. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with a cauterizing medicine, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the breast inclines downwards and becomes flaccid because of its size, as happens to women,
it is necessary to make two crescent-shaped incisions in its upper sides, each connecting to the other at their ends so that the larger line encircles the smaller one, in this manner: From line B to line C, then remove the skin between the incisions and remove the fat, and use what we have mentioned of sutures and dressings and whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If you are unable to cut away what needs to be cut because of the patient's anxiety or because of bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter forty-eight.
On the treatment of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the kind of hard, cystic swellings; some contain fluids.  Those that contain fluids should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner.
From line B to line C.  If all the fluid in the tumor is evacuated, then pack it with old cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the kind of nodular swellings, incise it as we mentioned in the incision for swellings. If the wound extends and pus forms, cauterize it as we previously mentioned.
Chapter forty-nine.
On incising a tumor that appears near an artery or vein, called an aneurysm.
If an artery is injured and the skin above it heals, a tumor often results; similarly, a vein may also swell and become tumorous.
The signs by which one knows whether the tumor and swelling are from an artery or a vein are as follows: if the tumor is from an artery, it will be oblong and deep-seated in the body; and if you press the tumor with your finger, you will feel a kind of crepitation.
That which is from a vein, the tumor is round and on the surface of the body. Incision of these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many other places of the body, and when they are very large;  therefore, one should avoid treating them with the iron.
And those which are also in the extremities or in the head should be avoided.  As for those which are a swelling of the mouth of an artery, make a longitudinal incision in the skin, then open the incision with hooks, then dissect the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I have described to you in the ligation of the two arteries in the temples; then incise with a scalpel the area between the ligatures until all the blood in it is removed.
Then the tumor will resolve, and you will use treatment that produces pus until the ligatures fall off; then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the tumor is from a vein incision, you should grasp with your hand as much of the tumor as possible along with the skin, then insert a needle below the area you grasped with your hand and pass it through, with a doubled thread, until you bring it out on the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly with it, as I have mentioned to you in tying the uvula from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads will slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire tumor at the crossing point of the first needle.
And tighten your threads in four places, then incise the tumor in its middle until what is inside comes out; then cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied. Then apply a compress that you have soaked in a potion and oil. Then use treatment with cautery and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor that occurs from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as a tumor occurs in the artery and vein, so a tumor occurs in the nerve if a blow happens to it or it happens from excessive exertion or the like. This is mostly in the regions of the wrists and heels.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a swelling that is deep-seated, its color resembling the rest of the body. In most instances, it is without pain, and if pressed firmly, the patient feels a kind of numbness. The swelling is not concentrated deep within the body.
Rather, it is under the skin, and it moves in every direction, but does not extend forward or backward. As for that which is in the joints, it should not be approached with iron, for it may cause gangrene. And as for that which is in the head or forehead...
then incise the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from its base. If it is large, hook it with a hook and peel it off, then remove it and close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
Chapter fifty-one.
On the excision of warts which appear in the abdomen.
Often, some people develop warts on their abdomens and other parts of their bodies, called "fungal" because of their resemblance to mushrooms. Their base is thin and their head is thick, their lips may be altered, and some are small while others become very large.
And I saw a man who had two warts on his abdomen which were most like mushrooms, white and thin at the base, their lips altered and cracked, and moisture constantly flowing from them.  I cut them off and weighed one at about eighteen ounces and the other at about six ounces.
The procedure for cutting them is as follows:  If the patient is moist, and the wart is white, moist, and thin at the base, cut it with a broad scalpel, and have cauteries ready in the fire, for often much blood flows when they are cut.
If the bleeding overwhelms you, cauterize it immediately. If you see that the patient is cowardly and frightened by cutting with iron, take a strong lead thread and tie it tightly around the wart of this description, and leave it for two days, then increase the tightness of the lead, continuing to tighten the lead.
Tighten it repeatedly until it affects the wart, so that it separates and falls off by itself without trouble. If the wart is thick at the base, there is some fear and uncertainty in cutting it, especially those in the abdomen; however, it may be possible to cut off half or some of it.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, and then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of cutting a wart that is dark in color, insensitive, and foul in appearance, for it is a cancerous tumor. We will discuss cancer later.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
On the treatment of umbilical hernias.
An umbilical hernia results from many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum of the abdomen, from which fat or intestine protrudes, as occurs in other hernias; or from blood emitted from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from wind that is retained there.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and the protrusion of fat, then the tumor will be similar in color to the body, soft, painless, and of varying appearance. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, its appearance will be more varied than what we have described. If you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns; sometimes it is accompanied by gurgling, and it increases significantly with bathing and strenuous exertion. If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
It does not disappear when pressed with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, in addition to these signs, the tumor will appear dark. If it is due to newly formed flesh, the tumor will be firm, hard, and remain the same size.
If it is due to wind, it will be soft to the touch. The treatment is as follows: if the umbilical hernia is due to blood from an artery or vein, or to wind, then you should abstain from treating it, for there is danger and uncertainty in this, as I have informed you in the chapter where I described the tumors that occur from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical hernia is due to the intestine or fat, then you should instruct the patient to restrain himself and stand upright and straight, then apply a bandage around the entire navel. Then instruct him to lie on his back between your hands, and then incise with a wide scalpel around the navel at the place you marked with ink. Then pull the center of the tumor upwards with a large hook, and then tie the incised area with strong thread or silk sinew tightly.
The knot of the ligature should be a loop. Then open the middle of the tightened tumor above the ligature and insert your index finger. Search for the intestine; if you find that the ligature has grasped it, loosen the loop and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find fat, pull it out with a hook.
Cut off its excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, ligate it carefully and return to your work. Take two needles and thread them with strong thread, and insert the needles into the incision you made around the tumor, crossing them, having passed them through. Then tighten the tumor in four places over the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the constricted flesh decays and falls off by itself, or cut it off when it becomes soft and decayed, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical hernia is from flesh that has grown there,
or from moisture, then you should constrict the tumor as we said, and remove the blood or moisture that you find there, then treat it with what will close the area.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medication, and warned against treating it with iron, lest it ulcerate, and we have mentioned cancer that develops in the uterus and warned against treating it.
And the ancients mentioned that if the cancer is in a place where it can all be excised, like the cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar accessible members, and its removal is possible in its entirety, especially if it is small and beginning; but if it has progressed and become large, then it should not be approached.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that.  The procedure, if it is accessible as we have said, is to first purge the patient with black hellebore several times, then to bleed him if there is evident fullness in the veins.
Then you position the patient in a position that allows you to work, then you apply hooks suitable for it to the cancer, then you scrape it from every side together with the skin, thoroughly, until nothing of its roots remains, and let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.
Rather, squeeze the areas and drain all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can. If during the procedure, profuse bleeding from a severed artery or vein obstructs you, cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter fifty-four.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have explained in the classification the types of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, and the signs of each type and its treatment with medications.  That which is treated with iron is only the ascitic type, and the tympanitic type and the fleshy type are not at all approached with iron.
For that is lethal, if you have treated this type of ascitic cancer with medication and your treatment has not been effective, then see if the patient is extremely weak or has another illness besides the cancer, such as…
a cough or diarrhea or the like, then beware of treating him with iron, for it is deception. If you see the patient strong, without illness other than the cancer alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the procedure is to stand the patient upright before you. and a servant behind him squeezing his belly with his hands and pushing the water downwards towards the pubis, then take a lancet like this:.
limited on both sides, long, with a pointed end like a lancet, except that it has a slight curve so that it does not penetrate the intestine during the procedure and injure it. Then look, if the cancer has developed from the side of the intestines.
then it is necessary that you make the incision three fingers' breadth below the navel in line with it above the pubis. If the cancer has developed from liver disease, then let your incision be three fingers' breadth to the left of the navel. If its development is from spleen disease, then let the incision be on the right side by three fingers' breadth.
Also, the incision should not be on the side on which the patient wants to lie down, lest the fluids flow to that weak area. Then pierce the whole skin with the instrument, then insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
with the lancet between the skin and the peritoneum as if you are flaying it, and the amount you flay should be about the size of a fingernail or so. Then pierce the peritoneum until the lancet reaches an empty place, which is the place of the water, then remove it and insert into the hole the instrument which is of this form.
It is like a tube of a thin reed made of silver or copper or smooth, polished lead. It has a small hole at its lower end and three holes in its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And one may sharpen its end in the shape of a pen nib, in this form:
At its upper end is a ring.  If the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately descend on the instrument, and you will evacuate a moderate amount of water at once. For if you evacuate more than is necessary at once, the patient may die from the dissolution of his animal spirit.
Or he may suffer a faintness approaching death. But evacuate according to his strength and what indicates to you the patient's condition from the strength of his pulse and the good color of his complexion. Then remove the instrument, and the water will be retained, for it will be retained immediately.
Because of the skin which holds the hole on the peritoneum which I told you to suture in that manner. Then you may reinsert the instrument another day if you see that the patient can bear it.
And you will also remove a small amount of water.  Do this for several days, and you must be careful and guard against error, until only a little water remains. If you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, treat him by burying him in hot sand.
And profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and enduring thirst, and treat him with drying medicines until he recovers. And cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as I described before.
Chapter fifty-five.
In the treatment of children who are born with their urinary passages unperforated, or with a narrow or misplaced opening.
Some boys may be born with their urethra imperforate; it is necessary to immediately perforate it at birth.
With a very fine scalpel, in this manner:
Then place a thin lead nail in the opening, tie it and keep it in place for three or four days. When he wants to urinate, remove it and then replace it. If you do not use the lead, it is possible that the urine flowing over the area will not allow it to close.
As for the one whose opening is narrow, it is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days until it widens.  Those whose opening is misplaced, such as those born with the opening at the end of the penis, cannot urinate forward.
He must raise the urethra upwards with his hand,  as semen cannot reach the uterus directly, a very serious problem. The procedure is as follows: the patient lies on his back.
Then stretch his penis with your left hand very tightly and incise the tip of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, like a pen nib, or as if you are carving something so that its middle is prominent, like a penis, and the opening is in the middle as it should be.
Be careful during the procedure to avoid bleeding, as this often occurs. Stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
On the ulcer that occurs in the foreskin and penis, and on blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This ulcer often occurs in the urethra; it is a fleshy, tough growth, and it can be malignant or non-malignant.  The non-malignant type should be tied off with a fine ligature.
Cut it until you remove it completely, then apply cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterwards with nut ointment until it heals. But if the ulcer is malignant and dark in color, cauterization should be used after it is cut and excised.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and part outside, then you should remove the ulcer inside first, until it heals; then treat the outside.
Because if you treat them both at the same time, you risk perforation of the foreskin.  Blackness and corruption can also occur in the female genitalia and the foreskin; you should excise everything that is black and tending towards or already corrupted.
Then apply honey mixed with crushed and sifted pomegranate peel and acacia, and then treat it with other treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped cautery iron in this manner:
Cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, namely bleeding and a corrupted wound. If the glans is eroded and destroyed entirely at some point, a lead tube should be inserted into the urethra for the patient to urinate through.  As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans…
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin is intact and who have not been circumcised.  Adhesion may also occur due to a wound or swelling. You should separate it with a blunt scalpel until the constriction is released and the glans is freed on all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them completely, you should remove some of the glans and some of the foreskin. The foreskin is thin and may easily perforate because of its thinness. Then separate the foreskin from the glans with a thin linen cloth moistened in cold water, so that it does not adhere again.
Then treat it with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
On the cleansing of boys and the treatment of what may befall them of error.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of a connection like other wounds, except that since it is done by our will and is used especially in boys, it is necessary to describe the best method for it.
And the easiest way leading to safety.  I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws, but rather it is something we have acquired.
by experience.  And that is that I found the majority of surgeons and barbers using purification with the knife and with the scissors, and they use the forceps and tying with thread and cutting with the fingernail.  I have tried all these methods.
I found nothing better than purification with scissors and tying with thread, because purification with the knife often harms the skin, because the skin of the foreskin is two layers, so perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower layer remains.
So one is forced to make another cut and renewed pain, and purification with forceps does not prevent cutting the end of the urethra, because it may enter its hole. As for purification with the fingernail, the skin may slip and your work will be spoiled, or the boy's skin may be naturally short...
Therefore, they are often born like that and do not need purification. I have seen this. As for purification with scissors and tying with thread, experience has revealed its superiority to me, because the cut of the scissors is proportionate, because the blade above is like the blade below.
So when you squeeze your hand with the proportion of the two blades, you cut with one measurement and in one time. Thus the thread becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra from all sides, with no mistake at all. The first step in the procedure is to reassure the boy.
Especially if he is one who understands a little, that you are only tying the thread in his urethra and leaving it until another day, then rejoice and please him in every way you can and what he accepts with his mind, then stand him before you, standing upright.
And let him not be sitting, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy's eye does not fall upon it at all, nor on any of the instruments. Then insert your hand into his urethra, inflate the skin, and lift it up until the head of the urethra comes out.
Then cleanse it of whatever dirt gathers there, then tie the marked place with a doubled thread, then tie a second one a little below it. Then hold the lower tie firmly with your thumb and index finger and cut between the two ties. Then quickly lift the skin upwards and bring out the head of the urethra, then let the blood flow a little; it is better and lessens the swelling of the urethra.  Then dry it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some burnt ash of dried gourd; it is the best I have tried, or finely ground barley; that is also excellent.
Then quickly lift the skin upwards and bring out the head of the urethra, then let the blood flow a little; it is better and lessens the swelling of the urethra.  Then dry it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some burnt ash of dried gourd; it is the best I have tried, or finely ground barley; that is also excellent. Then apply to the glans from above a pledget of white egg cooked in rosewater, beaten with fresh, good rose oil, and leave it on until the next day. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And this is the image of the scissors which are suitable for circumcision:
It should be thin, sharp, without any curve, well-sharpened, and the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of the handles. As for the mistake which occurs in circumcision, it is sometimes that the inner foreskin is completely or partially inverted during the cutting; it should be extended at once with your fingernail before the place swells.
And cut it evenly. If you are unable to grasp it with your fingernail, then pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days pass and what is under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, then leave it until the acute inflammation subsides and remove it gently.
And cut it according to what is convenient for you, and be careful of the glans penis; for if something is cut from the glans penis, it does not harm, so treat it with what heals the wound from the cauteries which we described in the chapter on cauteries.
And if more than the necessary amount of skin is cut and it retracts upwards, that also does not harm much, so treat it as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter fifty-eight.
On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to its obstruction by a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or a growth of flesh, and the like.  If you treat that with what we mentioned of the types of treatment described in the classification.
And if the urine does not flow, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which has lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that the patient sit on his knees, then one should mount on his back and extend his abdomen towards his back, and the patient should hold himself as much as he can.
Then the neck of the bladder is forced to push the stone backwards, and the urine flows. If it does not flow by what we mentioned, and the matter becomes severe for the patient, then it is necessary to use its extraction with the instrument called a catheter, whose image is this:
It is made of silver and is thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's quill in thinness, long about a span and a half, with a gentle funnel at its head. The way to draw the urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie to its end wool or cotton firmly.
And insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with scissors if any of the wool remains so that it enters the tube and closes it like a button. Then lubricate the catheter with oil, or butter, or egg white, and seat the patient on a chair.
And cleanse his bladder and urethra with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water. Then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside it.
Until, when the urethra is fully bent, then push the catheter inside until, when it reaches near the anus, incline the penis downwards with the catheter inside it, then push it until it reaches the bladder and the patient feels that it has reached something empty.
This is done in this manner because the passage through which the urine passes is tortuous. Then gently pull the thread with the wool, for the urine will follow the wool, then remove it and the urine will flow out.  And return the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
And the instruments suitable for this are made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as fine as pus.  And you wish to instill waters and medicines into it; this is done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its image:
It is made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as fine as a hair, hollow throughout except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow part in which the propellant is, should be only as much as it will fill without excess, so that when you draw something of the moisture with it, it is drawn, and when you push it, it is pushed to a distance, like the syringe that throws oil in sea battles.
Then if you wish to inject moisture into the bladder, you insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and draw upwards on the piston; then the moisture is drawn into the body of the syringe.  Then insert its tip into the urethra as we described in the catheters, and then push the moisture with the piston.
Then that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, until the patient feels it. And this is the image of a delicate clyster also with which the bladder is injected:
It is made of silver or lead, its upper end resembling a small funnel, and below it a groove in which the ligature lies. Then take a camel's bladder and put into it the moisture which you wish to inject into the bladder, and then bind it tightly between the two parts with a doubled thread.
And warm that moisture a little over the fire, then insert the tip of the clyster into the urethra, then press your hand firmly on the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of thin leather and make a circle from it and pierce it all around. Then insert a strong thread into those holes as it is twisted, then gather the circle as you gather a tablecloth, after you put in it what you want of moistures, ointments and water.
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, pressing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the extraction of a stone.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medications, and mentioned the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and the signs of all that, and mentioned the stone in which work with the hand and incision is done.
This is the stone generated specifically in the bladder and that which becomes lodged in the urethra, and I am describing that with clear explanation and brevity.
So I say that the stone generated in the bladder mostly affects boys, and among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its thinness.
And sand appears in it, and he scratches his penis and plays with it, and often it hangs down, then spreads, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them.  It is easy to remove in boys until they reach fourteen years, and difficult in old men; as for young men, it is intermediate between those.
And the one whose stone is larger, his treatment is easier, and the small one is the opposite.  So if we proceed to treatment, it is necessary first that the patient be given an enema to remove all the fecal matter in his intestines, for it may prevent the stone from being found upon examination.
Then the patient is taken by his feet and shaken and jolted downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place repeatedly. Then you seat him before you upright, with his hands under his thighs, so that the entire bladder is inclined downwards, then examine him.
And palpate him externally. If you feel the stone in the space, then immediately begin to incise it. If it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to lubricate the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If he is a fully developed boy, then insert it into his rectum and search for the stone until, when it is under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder. Then press on it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place you intend to incise.
And you order a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and you order another servant to stretch the labia upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand to stretch the skin beneath the labia away from the place where the incision will be. Then take the sharp scalpel, whose image is this:
And incise between the rectum and the labia, not in the middle, but towards the left buttock.  The incision should be on the stone itself, with your finger in the rectum, and you pressing it outwards obliquely, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, to the extent that the stone can exit.
Not larger, for perhaps the finger in the rectum will press the stone during the incision, and it will come out without difficulty. And know that there may be stones with angles and edges, which makes their removal difficult for that reason.
And some are smooth, resembling an acorn and round, and easily removed.  As for those with angles and edges, increase the incision slightly. If it does not come out like this, then you should try to grasp it, either by seizing it with a firm forceps whose end is like a file.
To hold the stone firmly so that it does not escape, or to insert a delicate, curved instrument beneath it. If you cannot manage it, widen the incision slightly. If blood overwhelms you, stop it with alum.
If there is more than one, push the largest first towards the opening of the bladder, then incise upon it, then push the smaller ones afterwards.  Do likewise if there are more than two. If it is extremely large, it is ignorance to make a large incision upon it, for this exposes the patient to one of two things.
Either death, or a constant dribbling of urine, because the wound will not heal at all. But try to push it out, or try to break it with forceps until you remove it in pieces.
When you have finished your work, cauterize the wound with myrrh, aloes, and acacia, and bandage it, and place over it a cloth moistened with oil and wine, or rose oil and cold water to soothe the inflammation. Then let the patient lie on his back, and do not remove the bandage until the third day.
When it loosens, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with palm-tree ointment and basil-ointment until it heals. If excessive inflammation, suppuration, and the like occur in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder and preventing urination—and this is known by the appearance of blood in the urine—
insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains it will lead to corruption and putrefaction of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type of complication with its appropriate therapy until it heals.
In all treatments, it is necessary to bind and bring together the thighs to secure the medications applied to the area. If the stone is small and has lodged in the urethra, preventing the passage of urine, treat it as I have described before it requires incision.
Often I have dispensed with incision using this treatment, which I have tested; it involves taking a probe of steel, which has this shape:
The tip is triangular, sharp, and fixed in a shaft; then take a thread and tie the penis below the stone, so that it does not return to the bladder; then gently insert the probe into the urethra until the probe reaches the stone itself.
And turn the probe in the stone itself little by little, intending to pierce it until you pass through to the other side; then the urine will immediately flow. Then press on what remains of the stone from outside the penis; it will break up and be expelled with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not possible due to some impediment, tie a thread below the stone and another above it; then incise over the stone in the penis itself between the two threads and remove it.
Then untie the ligature and clean away the clotted blood in the wound.  The reason for tying the thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other ligature above is so that when the thread is untied after the stone is removed, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should raise the skin upwards so that it returns and covers the wound when you are finished, as we said.
Chapter sixty-one.
On the removal of stones from women.
Stones are rarely generated in women.  If a woman is afflicted with a stone, its treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons. One is that the woman may be a virgin; the other is that you will not find a woman who permits herself to a physician.
If she is chaste or related, and thirdly, you will not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially in manual work, and fourthly, the incision site for stones in women is distant from the location of the stone, requiring a deep incision.
And in that there is danger. If necessity demands it, then a skilled female physician should be sought; they are rarely found. If you cannot find one, seek a chaste and gentle male physician, or procure a skilled midwife experienced in women's matters, or a woman who knows something of this craft.
Then prepare her and instruct her to do everything you order, first examining for the stone. That is, see if the woman is a virgin. Then you should insert a finger into her rectum and search for the stone; if you find it and press it under your finger.
Then instruct her to incise it. If she is not a virgin but a widow, then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it firmly.
If she finds it, then she should trace it from the opening of the bladder downwards as far as she can reach, until she reaches the groin.  Then she should incise it opposite the middle of the vagina at the groin, from whichever side the stone is felt in that area.
And her finger should not leave the stone, pressing on it. Let the incision be small at first, then introduce the dilator into that small incision. If she feels the stone, enlarge the incision as much as is needed for the stone to come out. And know that there are many types of stones.
Some are small, others large; smooth, rough; long, round, and branched. Know their types so that you can determine what you need. If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered verdigris on the area and hold it for a while until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out. And be sure to have with you the instruments mentioned for removing stones from men, to assist you in your work. If the bleeding is excessive and you determine from the throbbing of the blood that an artery has been severed, then apply styptics to the area.
And bind it tightly with bandages and leave it; do not revisit it, and leave the stone and do not remove it, for the patient might die. Then treat the wound. When the severity of the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area has become infected, return to your work until the stone is removed.
Chapter Sixty-two.
On incision of the water bladder.
Hydrocele is an accumulation of moisture in the tunica albuginea, which is under the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle.  It may be in a special membrane prepared by nature on one side of the testicle.
So that one thinks it is another testicle. It is between the skin of the scrotum and the tunica albuginea that we mentioned, but this is rare. This hydrocele is generated from a weakness that affects the testicles, so that this substance collects there.  It may also result from a blow to the testicles.
This moisture is of many colors; it may be yellowish, or bloody red, or black and purulent, or white and watery—which is most common. The signs by which it is recognized are:
Where the water collects, if it is in the tunica albuginea that we mentioned, the swelling is roundish and slightly elongated, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a special membrane, then the swelling is round on one side of the testicle.
Therefore, a person imagines it to be another testicle. If the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the tunica albuginea, then it is palpable.  But if you want to know the color of the moisture, explore the swelling with the square probe whose image we have shown previously; whatever comes out after the probe, you judge it by what is inside.
If we proceed to treatment with cautery, it is necessary to order the patient to be bled if he is able and you see his body is full. Then he lies on his back on something slightly elevated, and you place many cloths under him, and you sit on his left.
And you order a servant to sit on his right, stretching his penis toward one side of the scrotum and toward the region of the groin. Then you take a wide scalpel and incise the skin of the scrotum lengthwise in the middle to near the pubis.
Make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotum in half, until it reaches the tunica albuginea.  Then strip it back, being careful not to cut it.  Your stripping should be more from the side attached to the testicle, and strip as much as you can.
Then you widely incise the tunica albuginea filled with water and remove all the water. Then you separate the edges of the incision with hooks and stretch the tunica albuginea upwards, but do not touch the containing skin of the scrotum, and cut the tunica albuginea however you can cut it, either all at once or piece by piece.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not completely cut it, you cannot be sure the water will not return. If the testicle emerges from its covering during your work, then when you have finished cutting the tunica albuginea, replace it and then close the edges of the scrotum skin with sutures.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals. If the testicle is already damaged by another disease, then you should tie off the vessels in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat it as we have described.
If the fluid is collected in both sides, know that they are two hydroceles. Incise the other side as you did the first, and if it is convenient to do it all at once, do so, then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil, and externally apply more wool soaked in a drink and oil, and spread it over the testicles and the flanks of the abdomen, and place folded cloths on top of it, which are the pads. And tie it on top with a bandage that has six ends, in this manner:
Then two cloths are taken, sewn together, and stuffed with fluffy wool in this manner. Make the ties with wet cotton or wool, and tighten them with the waistband of the trousers, and one end is taken across the buttocks to the back.
The second is taken towards the pubis, and the two ends to the thighs below, and the remaining two ends to the groins, and all the tightening is gathered in the waistband of the trousers. This hydrocele may also be treated by cauterization instead of incision with an iron.
This is to take a fine, knife-like cautery and with it incise the skin of the testicle while it is hot, as we have described, until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed; then take another cautery of this shape:
It resembles the Greek eye, then sear that peritoneum with it while it is hot until all the moisture comes out. Then spread the peritoneum with hooks and peel off the containing layer with the cautery and cut it as much as you can, until you excise all of it, and protect the testicle so that the fire does not touch it.
Know that this procedure is safer and prevents more blood loss, and is better than the incision method. If during the incision or cauterization you encounter a hot swelling, bleeding, or something else, then you should treat whatever arises with the appropriate treatment, as previously described.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot endure this procedure because of its unpleasantness, then use cauterization as I describe, if it is proven to you by the evidence we have presented.
If the hydrocele is watery, then the patient should sit on a raised chair, then sear the lower part of the swelling with a wide scalpel, and make the cauterization along the length of the body, and make the opening wide so that all the water flows out.  Then place cotton on the area and bind it.
And leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not come out during cauterization, and this is because the tunica albuginea obstructs the mouth of the wound, preventing the water from coming out,
then you should insert a goose feather into the wound, or the instrument used to extract water from abscesses, the image of which has been shown previously, or enlarge the opening of the wound slightly.
And know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so. If it accumulates, cauterize it in the same way, and the patient should observe his days of rest.
Chapter sixty-three.
Concerning the incision on the fleshy scrotum and its treatment.
Know that an incision on this scrotum is fraught with danger, leading to death in most cases. Therefore, we advise leaving it alone and ensuring its safety. I will, however, mention its treatment and the types of swelling.
I say that many swellings may occur in the bodies which constitute the testicles, and this is due to many causes; either from an excessive, acrid humor which descends to the testicles, or from a blow. The swelling is the color of the body and contains no water.
The swelling may be soft, or it may be hardened, its color dark, and without sensation. It may be due to a complication of the arteries and their swelling, as previously mentioned, or from a swelling of the veins.  That which is from a swelling of the arteries is recognized by the dispersion of the swelling.
If you press it with your fingers, it does not disperse.  It should not be incised. As for that which is from a swelling of the veins, nothing of it disperses when pressed with the fingers. This type may be incised, as may other flesh.
It is to incise the skin of the testicle, then to extend the testicle upwards and to remove it from the white peritoneum. Free the spermatic cord from the vessels, ligate the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from every part of the testicle; if the testicle is adherent to that growing flesh.
Then it is necessary to remove the testicle and cut it. And if the adhesion is between some of the peritonea or between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular cut.
If the growth of flesh is in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it and remove the testicle as we said. When your work is completed, dress the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Four.
On the treatment of hydrocele with a hernia.
A hernia is a twisted tumor, somewhat twisted, resembling a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the intestines and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking.  The treatment of this disease is very close to what has been mentioned before.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as the ancients did. I say that it is necessary to have the patient sit on a high chair, then push the intestinal contents downwards, then grasp the scrotum with your fingers along with the vessels that are close to the penis.
And let an assistant hold it and stretch it strongly, then you incise with a wide, sharp scalpel an oblique incision along the vessels until the vessels are exposed, then dissect from each side as I have described to you in the dissection of the arteries in the armpits, then insert a needle with a doubled thread.
And tie it at the first place where the hernia appeared and tie it also at the end, then incise it in the middle with a vertical incision along the length of the body and remove what has gathered in it of the foul, putrid fluids.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds that you want to heal for a period of time so that the vessels that nourish one of the intestines fall off, there is no harm in that. If the hernia affects all the vessels, it is necessary to remove one of the intestines with the vessels, lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment. before cutting the vessels, so that they wither and are of no use.
Chapter sixty-five.
In the treatment of intestinal hernia.
This hernia occurs from a fissure that appears in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen near the groins from the flank of the abdomen, and the intestine descends from that rupture into one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from a fissure in the peritoneum or from its extension, and these two types occur from many causes, either a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting something heavy, and so on.  Its sign, if it is from the extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is even to the depth because the peritoneum constricts the intestine.  Its sign, if it is from a fissure in the peritoneum, is that it initially causes great pain suddenly, and the swelling is uneven, appearing under the skin nearby.
That is because the intestine exits and goes outside of the peritoneum.  The omentum may also exit with the intestine, and this hernia is called intestinal and omental. It may be with wind, and feces may flow into the intestine and be retained there, resulting in the death of the patient.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling, especially if constricted. Treatment of these types of illness with iron is dangerous, so one should be cautious about engaging in it. The method of treatment is to instruct the patient to return the intestine into his abdomen by hand if it is possible to return it.
Then he lies on his back in your hands and raises his legs. Then you stretch the skin next to the groin upwards and incise the entire skin of the scrotum lengthwise. Then you insert hooks into the edges of the incision to the extent needed to open the incision with them.
The incision should be large enough for the testicle to emerge. Then you dissect the membranes under the scrotal skin until the firm white peritoneum is exposed on all sides. Then insert your index finger next to the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum under the testicular skin and the second peritoneum, and loosen the adhesion behind the testicle. Then, with the right hand, you pull inwards on the scrotal skin, while with the left hand you stretch the white peritoneum upwards and lift the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision.
You instruct the assistant to pull the testicle upwards, and you completely loosen the adhesions from behind. You explore with your finger lest there be any twisted intestine in the firm white peritoneum; if you find any, push it down into the abdomen.
Then you take a needle with thick thread, twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum under the scrotal skin next to the incision. Then you cut the ends of the thread loop so that there are four threads. Then you place some of them on top of each other in a firm manner, and tie the peritoneum, which we said is under the scrotal skin, tightly on two sides. Then you also twist the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing from the vessels that nourish it can reach it. Lest a hot swelling result from that, and you also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, less than two fingers away from it. After these two ligatures, you leave a length of peritoneum under the scrotal skin equal to the width of a finger.
Lest a hot swelling result from that, and you also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, less than two fingers away from it. After these two ligatures, you leave a length of peritoneum under the scrotal skin equal to the width of a finger. And you cut all the rest in a circular manner and remove the testicle with it. Then you make an incision at the bottom of the scrotal skin from which blood and pus will flow, as we described previously. Then use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and use the ligature that we described.
And one may cauterize the white peritoneum which, as we said, is cut, cautiously, to prevent bleeding, for this often occurs. And you leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.  If it is slow to fall off, then loosen it with warm water and apply something that will make it sweat until it falls off.
Then you treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter sixty-six.
Concerning the windy hernia.  I have not seen anyone dare to treat this windy hernia with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described in the hernia with a dālīyah, that is, that the vessels should be gently tied below after the incision upon it.
Then you incise in the middle and treat the tumor with what opens it until the vessels fall away, and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter sixty-seven.
Concerning the hernia which is in the groin.
A hernia may appear in the groin, as we said, so that the place swells but nothing of the intestine descends into the scrotum. And if it descends, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if time passes, the fissure in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and epiploon descend into the scrotum.  And this happens from the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we said. That is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and the place swells and protrudes. And its treatment is by cautery, as I previously described.
And it may be treated with an iron instrument in this manner: the patient lies on his back between your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia horizontally to the extent of three fingers, then you separate the peritoneum which is under the skin.
Until the white peritoneum which follows is exposed, then you take a roll and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen. Then you sew the two protruding parts of the peritoneum to the edge of the roll, and you adhere one to the other with the suture.
Then you withdraw the roll, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I instructed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then you treat it with the treatment of wounds.
If the threads are cut, I clean them and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the hernia does not protrude further.
Cauterization is better in this place because it is closer to safety.
Chapter sixty-eight.
On the relaxation of the skin of the scrotum.
The skin of the scrotum often relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, and its appearance is unsightly.  Whoever wishes to treat it should put the patient to sleep on his back.
And he cuts all the relaxed skin over the thick skin, then brings the two lips together; and if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, and make sure of the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, I should not have mentioned it in this book, but I mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that it may be in the knowledge of the physician if he is asked about it, and that he may know the treatment of one who has undergone it; and the other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as lambs, goats, cats, and the like of animals.  So I say that castration is of two types, either by crushing or by incision and cutting. That which is by crushing, its method is that we seat the animal in hot water until its testicles relax and soften and hang down.
Then crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not discernible upon touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with your left hand, then tie the cords and make one incision on each testicle.
Until, when the testicles appear, cut them off after you have skinned them, and do not leave on them anything of the membranes except the thin membrane which is on the vessels. This type of castration is better than that which is by crushing.
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal desires mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
In the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two types. One is that which appears in the area behind the scrotum or in the skin of the scrotum between the testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva, with hair; and urine may flow from that which is in the skin of the scrotum.
As for women, there is one type, and it is above the vulva on the pubis like small male genitalia, protruding outward; one of them is like a man's penis, and the two are like testicles.  And the treatment of the three types.
The two types in men and the one type in women: it is necessary to cut away that excess flesh until its trace is removed, then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals. As for the second type in men, from which urine flows, which is in the scrotum's skin, there is no action in it, nor is there any benefit from its removal.
Chapter seventy-one.
On the excision of the clitoris and the protruding flesh from the vulvas of women.
The clitoris may exceed the natural amount until it becomes large and its appearance ugly, and it may become large in some women until it is spread like that of men and becomes suitable for intercourse.
It is necessary that you grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it, and do not exaggerate in the cutting, especially in the depth of the origin, lest bleeding occurs.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And sometimes it protrudes outwards like a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients call it the "tail" disease.  It should be cut as you cut the clitoris, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
In the treatment of prolapse.
Prolapse is when a woman's vulva is not perforated, or the perforation is small. This can be either natural, from birth, or accidental. The accidental kind results from a pre-existing condition, and may be due to excess, newly grown flesh.
or a thin or thick membrane. It may be located in the depth of the uterus, or in its sides, or above or below it.  It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and may even prevent menstruation.  Its identification is done by examination by a midwife.
If the obstruction is apparent and close, but if it is not apparent, she should examine it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is a thin membrane and close to the labia, proceed to break it.  This is done by placing something like pledgets on the labia, then placing both thumbs together.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread. Then, forcefully stretch the labia until the thin membrane is broken and the obstruction opens. Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area. The woman should have intercourse every day so that the area does not close up again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel resembling an Asian leaf. If the obstruction is from newly grown flesh, hook it with hooks and cut it. Have styptics on hand that do not sting, such as acacia,  cistus, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not close quickly. Keep it in place for a few days and use a dry linen wick. Then treat it with the usual treatment for healing until it heals.  Other fleshy growths may appear in the uterus; these should be cut in the same manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor.  A cancerous tumor in the uterus should never be treated with iron.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules that appear in the vulva of women.
As for hemorrhoids, they are a swelling of the mouths of the veins, so that much blood constantly flows from them. If hemorrhoids are neglected, they become warts.  Their types and signs have been mentioned in the classification, and we will mention them here.
What of them is treatable and what is not treatable. I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep within the uterus and do not appear to the touch, are not treatable with iron.  Those which are in the mouth of the uterus and are palpable are those which are treated.
It is necessary that the woman enter a cool room, then she should stretch the warts with a hook or a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots, then she should apply to them, when the bleeding occurs, one of the styptics that stops the blood without cauterization.
Such as acacia,  tragacanth, and frankincense and the like, then she should raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding continues, then seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, and gallnuts, and the like. Then take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it as a compress to her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise, apply cupping glasses to the loins and breasts without restriction. Then take wool, dip it in the juice of  hemlock or the juice of  fenugreek or the juice of  ivy branches with a decoction of gallnuts, and apply it to the area.
If the swelling subsides, then treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of  lice, rough in appearance. It is necessary to cut what appears of it, according to what I mentioned concerning warts, the same, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the abscess which occurs in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, the hardened tumor, ulcers, the polyp, the phagedenic ulcer, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and the hot tumor. I have mentioned all of these diseases, their types, and their signs in the classification.
It is necessary that we mention in this chapter the hot tumor which occurs in the uterus, if it is from among the tumors which collect over time, how its treatment with iron is. It is necessary to observe; if the pain of the tumor in its beginning is sharp with throbbing, inflammation, and fever,
and you see it red when you touch it, do not hasten to treat it [with cautery] and treat it with what helps in suppuration until, when these symptoms subside, then it is necessary that the woman sit on a chair with two seats and lean on her back.
and she gathers her legs towards the lower abdomen and her thighs are spread apart and her arms are under her knees and you bind them with a suitable ligature.
Then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the mouth of the uterus is opened, the image of which comes later.  It is necessary, if you want to use this instrument, that you measure with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.
This harms the patient. If the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary to place pledgets on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and it is necessary that the screw which moves in the instrument be from the upper side.
And you hold the instrument and the assistant turns the screw until the cervix is opened.  If the abscess appears and is touched by the hand and is soft and thin, then it is necessary to incise it at its head with a wide scalpel.  When all the matter has been evacuated,
it is necessary to place in the wound a soft tent soaked in rose oil or green oil containing some astringent. The tent should be outside the incision in the cervix, and clean wool soaked in water in which alchemilla has been boiled should be placed outside on the uterus and on the pubis.
Then treat it after two days with the ointment which is suitable for that until it heals.
And the uterus and wound may be washed by injecting with honey and water, then with water in which licorice root or long rhubarb has been boiled, then return to the ointment. If the abscess is hidden inside the uterus,
then it is necessary to abstain from treating it with iron, but it should be treated as we mentioned in the section.
Chapter seventy-five.
In teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural way.
The midwife should first know the form of a natural birth.  Its signs are: if you see the woman straining downwards and yearning to breathe the air, and what she is experiencing from labor becomes easier for her.
And the emergence of the fetus is hastened. Know that this birth is in the natural way, and its emergence is head-first with the placenta either with it or hanging from its navel. If you see these signs, then you should press her belly so that the fetus comes out quickly.
For if it descends head-first, the placenta descends with it and cleanses well from those impurities. Anything other than this birth is unnatural and blameworthy, for the fetus may emerge feet-first, or its hands and feet may emerge before its head.
Or one hand or one foot, or its head and hand may emerge, or it may emerge folded, and perhaps it turns onto its back, and similar blameworthy forms.  Therefore, the midwife should be skillful and gentle with all these things and beware of mistakes and errors.
And I will explain each form and how to deal with it, so that you may learn and understand it. If the fetus emerges head-first, the natural emergence, and this is difficult for the woman and labor is hard for her, and you see that her strength has weakened, then seat her on a chair and instruct women to hold her steady.
And compress her womb with cooked fenugreek and moist ointments, then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers and cuts the placenta with it, or cuts it with her fingernail until the moisture within flows out, and she presses the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then she should inject the woman with fenugreek saliva mixed with shirāj ointment, then after the injection, instruct her to strain and make her sneeze with a sternutatory, holding her mouth and nose, for the fetus will emerge immediately. If the hands of the fetus emerge first, then they should be gently returned little by little.
If they do not come to enter, place the woman on a raised platform and raise her legs upwards, then shake the platform on the ground while the woman holds on so that she does not fall when it is shaken. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them moderately, for then he will emerge.  The emergence of the fetus with its feet: If the fetus emerges with its feet, then they should be pushed upwards, then the fetus is turned little by little until it is straightened, then one of its feet is taken and extended little by little.
If they emerge to the thighs, instruct her to strain and make her sneeze with a sternutatory, for then it will emerge. If it does not emerge as we have described, otherwise, return the fetus little by little until it is brought to its natural form, for then it will emerge easily. If it is prevented by all that we have described.
Take some saliva of *khatmi*, some saliva of fenugreek, shirāj ointment, and dissolved gum, and pound all well together in a mortar, then apply it to the vulva of the woman and the lower part of her abdomen, then seat her in lukewarm water until it reaches the shrasīf.
If you see that her lower parts have become soft, make a pessary for her from myrrh and she should endure it; and if the pessary remains in place for an hour, then seat her on a chair, then make her sneeze, and close her mouth and nose, and gently press down on her lower abdomen; then the fetus will emerge immediately. The emergence of the fetus on its knees and hands.
If it emerges in this manner, gradually insert your hands little by little; then the woman lies on her back and lowers her hips, while lying on a bed, and clasps her hands, then press gently on her abdomen little by little. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that her lower parts are raised. If the fetus does not emerge, take both her legs and move them vigorously, then press gently above the symphysis pubis little by little until the fetus ascends, then the midwife inserts her hand and adjusts the fetus little by little.
And order the woman to strain until the fetus emerges. The emergence of the fetus transversely, one of its hands hanging down.  Gently replace its hand; and if you are unable to replace it, make the woman stand and walk; and if she is unable to walk, let her lie down.
on her bed and shake her legs vigorously; then use the poultice which I described from the ingredients. If labor pains seize her, seat her on a chair, then work to replace the hand and adjust the fetus to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and order her to strain until it emerges.
The emergence of the fetus on its back, extending its hands, and its face towards its mother's back. The midwife should grasp the hand of the fetus, then turn it little by little and gently adjust it; and when it is adjusted, apply to the vulva what we described of ointments and poultices.
Then tell her to move little by little; and if she does that, seat her on a chair and tell her to lean to the right side; then tell her to strain and make her sneeze with a sternutatory; then it will emerge. The emergence of the fetus upright on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the womb in this manner with the placenta, tear the placenta with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture; and if it adheres to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the navel lest it be choked and die; then push the fetus inwards until it is as it should be.
And tell the woman to strain repeatedly, then it will emerge easily. The emergence of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are frequently born, and three or four may be born and live, although this is rare; but as for five, it is something outside of nature, and they will not live at all.
And they are surrounded, even if numerous, by one placenta, and they are separated by a membrane-like barrier between them, attached to the navel of each one of them.  And they may emerge, like a single fetus, in a natural and easy manner, and they may emerge in a blameworthy manner as we described.
If some of them are difficult at birth and come to what we have mentioned of unnatural forms, then treat them as we have described. And let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and slowness, and contrive for every form with whatever means she can devise that leads to safety.
Mention of what is conceived in the uterus of fetuses that are aborted. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the uterus.  It has been confirmed to me that a woman aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of them conceived.
By the estimation of the All-Knowing, All-Mighty One. All of this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, for perhaps such a thing will befall her someday, and she may deal with it as is appropriate.
Chapter seventy-six.
On the removal of a dead fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus with what I mentioned in the section on treatment, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to work with your hand, then you should look: if the woman is healthy and strong, and there is nothing wrong with her, nothing from among the symptoms which one fears might cause her harm, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
And her head should be tilted downwards and her legs raised, and a servant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, lest her body be pulled when the fetus is extracted.
Then moisten her vulva with moist ointments, along with mallow juice, fenugreek, and flaxseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these ointments and juices, then gently insert it into the womb, then search with it for a place to hook the fetus, and the appropriate places for that.
See, if the fetus is positioned to descend head first, then hook it in its eyes, or in the nape of its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or its collarbone, or in places near the ribs, or under the clavicles.
But if it descends feet first, then [hook it] in the pubis and the middle ribs.  And you should hold the hook with the right hand, and place its bend between the fingers of the left hand, and insert the hand gently and hook one of those places we mentioned.
Until you reach something empty, then insert another hook opposite it, or a third if needed, so that the traction is even and does not tilt to one side. Then pull with a steady pull, and the pull should not be straight only, but moved to each side.
So that its exit is facilitated, as is done with a molar when it is extracted.  In the meantime, the pull should be relaxed. If it gets stuck on one side, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with ointment and insert them from that side to rotate what is stuck. If part of the fetus emerges, then move the hooks to other places.
She [the midwife] raises it a little, doing this until the whole fetus comes out. If a hand comes out before anything else and cannot be returned because of its compression, then you should wrap a cloth around it and pull it until, when it has all come out, you cut it.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.  And thus you should do with the other hand and with the feet. If the head of the fetus is large and experiences difficulty in exiting, or if there is collected water in its head, then you should insert a hooked scalpel between the fingers.
And split the head with it so that the water comes out, or puncture it with the instrument called the perforator, the image of which comes with the images of the other instruments in the chapter which follows this one.
Similarly, if the fetus is naturally large-headed, then you should split the skull or perforate it with the perforator as we said, then remove the bones with the forceps. If the head emerges and is compressed at the clavicle, then let it be split so that the moisture in the chest is released.
For the chest then becomes constricted. If the chest does not become constricted and it is not possible for it to come out, then cut as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or if there is a swelling in it, then you should puncture it so that the moisture flows from it.
If the fetus is in a breech presentation, then pulling it is easy and straightening it towards the mouth of the uterus is simple. If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, then you should pull it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand, and split the abdomen or chest until what is in them flows out.
If all the members are extracted and the head is retracted and retained, let the midwife insert her left hand. If the mouth of the uterus is open, then let her insert her hand into the neck of the uterus and search for the head with it, and pull it with her fingers to the mouth of the uterus, then insert a hook or two hooks into it and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the uterus has become constricted due to a hot swelling affecting it, then you should not be forceful with it, but rather you should then use the pouring of moist, fatty things and use compresses, and sit in waters that relax and moisten.
But if the fetus is on its side, then if it is possible to straighten it, let him use what we mentioned for the living fetus. If that is not possible, then let him cut pieces and extract it.  And it should not be that anything of the placenta remains inside at all.  When you have finished your treatment, then use what we mentioned of the treatment for the hot swellings that appear in the uteruses.
If bleeding occurs, then let her descend into astringent waters and use all other treatments. And I have witnessed a woman who had conceived, and the fetus died in her womb, then she conceived again upon it.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a swelling appeared in her womb and it swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close, so I placed on it some strong, drawing ointments.
Then a bone emerged from the place, then days passed and another bone emerged. I was amazed by this, since the abdomen is a place where there is no bone. I considered that it was from the bones of the dead fetus, so I examined the wound and extracted from it many bones from the bones of the head of the fetus.
I continued doing that until I extracted many bones from her, and the woman was in the best of conditions. And she lived like that for a time, discharging a little pus from the place. And I have only brought here this rare thing.
Because in it there is knowledge and help for what the skillful physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
Chapter seventy-seven.
In it are images of the instruments needed for extracting the fetus.
Image of a spiral instrument to open the mouth of the womb.
This is the binder with which books are bound; it has two spirals at the ends of the two pieces of wood, except that this spiral should be finer than the binder, and should be either of ebony or of boxwood, and the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers.
And their width about a finger, and their length a span and a half, and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two guide-pieces of the same material, firmly attached to them; their length is half a span or a little more, and their width about two fingers or a little more, and these two guide-pieces...
are those which enter the mouth of the womb to open it when you turn the spirals. Image of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter.
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two guide-pieces at its end, as you see; the length of each guide-piece is about a span, and their width is two fingers.  If you wish to open the womb with it,
then seat the woman on a bed with her legs hanging down, spread apart between her thighs; then insert these two guide-pieces, closely together, into the mouth of the womb, while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs; then open your hand with the instrument as you do with hooks, to whatever extent you desire to open the womb. until the midwife does what she wants. Image of another spiral mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument which pushes the fetus.
Image of the forceps with which the head of the fetus is grasped.
It resembles scissors, it has teeth at the end as you see, and it may be made rectangular like hooks, in this image as you see, it has teeth like the teeth of a saw, to cut and tear with it.
Image of a pusher also.
Image of a hook.
This hook should have a little thickness so that it does not break when pulling the fetus with it. Image of a hook with two prongs.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more numerous their types and the better prepared they are by the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his standing among people.  Therefore, do not despise any instrument that you have prepared, for there will certainly be need for it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In the removal of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold herself, then make her sneeze with a sternutatory, and press your hand on her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out this way, well and good; otherwise, take a measure.
And pierce a hole in the lid, and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as fumitory, rue, dill, chamomile, wormwood, marshmallow, and centaury—all these drugs or some of them. Immerse them in water and place them on the fire, then place a silver tube over the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
And hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then make her sneeze as we said.  Then the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in goose grease or mallow sap.
Then she inserts it into the vagina and searches for the placenta. If she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out little by little. If it is attached deep in the womb, insert the hand as we have described, until you find the placenta, then pull it out little by little, carefully.
Lest the womb fall out with a strong pull, but rather it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then the amount of pulling is increased, then it will yield and be freed from adhesion.  If the mouth of the womb is constricted, we have described treatment with sneezing and the treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out by all that we have described, avoid violence in pulling it again.  But it should be bound where it came out to the mouth of the womb to the woman's thigh, then inject it with the four-ingredient ointment, for it will cause it to rot after a few days.
And it will dissolve and come out, except that if it rots, a foul smell will rise from it to the stomach and head, and that will harm the patient.  Therefore, suitable fumigation should be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients tried fumigation with rue and dried figs.  The image of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated in the case of retained menses, placenta, and the like:
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or made of copper. The narrow end is placed in the vagina, and the wide end over the fire, with the incense placed on the coals.  It is held until that incense is gone, and then more is added.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
On the treatment of the non-perforated fistula.
Many boys are born with their anus imperforate; a thin membrane obstructs it.  It is necessary for the midwife to perforate this membrane with her finger; otherwise, she should puncture it with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to injure the muscle.
Then she should apply wool soaked in syrup and oil, and then treat it with ointments until it heals. If she fears it will close up, she should place a lead tube in the opening for many days, removing it whenever the child wishes to defecate.
The anus may also become obstructed by the healing of a wound or a tumor.  This adhesion should be incised, and then treated as previously described, with the lead tube.
Chapter Eighty.
On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower parts.
Fistulas which occur in the lower parts are a complication and thickening which occurs near the anus, externally or internally, from one side or another. The fistula may be single or multiple.
If this complication becomes chronic, it opens and discharges a thin, white, watery fluid or pus. Some of these fistulas may communicate with the rectum and the intestine, while others do not.  Those which communicate may be recognized by the passage of feces and flatus when the patient defecates.
Worms may also emerge from them.  There may be fistulas which, if they are internal, communicate with the bladder and the urethra.  Some may communicate with the hip joint and the sacrum. A fistula communicating with the rectum is also distinguishable from one which does not.
Insert your index finger into the rectum and introduce a thin probe into the fistula, made of copper or iron, if the fistula is not tortuous. If it is tortuous, introduce a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair with your finger. If you feel neither and nothing emerges from the opening—neither feces, nor flatus, nor worms, as we have said—know that it is not communicating, and proceed with treatment.
If the fistula communicates with the bladder or urethra, the sign is the passage of urine from it, and the failure of the site to heal with medication. If it communicates with the hip joint or sacrum, the sign is that the probe reaches there.
If it is not tortuous to the bone, and pain is present in that area, and pus constantly discharges from it, and treatment is ineffective and it does not heal with ointment—all these communicating fistulas are incurable.
Treatment is a vain effort for those ignorant physicians who attempt it.  As for those that are not communicating and not chronic, healing is hoped for with cautery, as I shall describe and as I have proven. The patient should lie on his back between your hands.
Raise his legs and incline his thighs towards his abdomen.  Then insert a copper or lead probe if the fistula is tortuous, until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the anus, you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel with your finger that the probe has passed openly without feeling any septum or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is communicating; therefore, do not exert yourself, for there is no cure, as we have said.
It has been said that it heals in rare cases. Among the treatments from which benefit is hoped for is to heat a thin cautery iron according to the width of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and to insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches towards the anus, and then to repeat this two or three times.
Until you know that all that excess, matted flesh resembling a bird's quill has been burned. Then treat it with lint soaked in butter until the burned flesh comes out, then treat it with healing ointments, and if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment. But if you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick partition of flesh or peritoneum between them, and you see the fistula near the surface of the skin, then incise the skin at the beginning of the fistula. And as you pass with the incision along with the probe which is in the fistula, until you reach with the incision where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe becomes free and falls out; then cleanse that matted flesh resembling a bird's quill, and leave nothing of it.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the bleeding overwhelms you and prevents you from cutting that flesh, the best and quickest remedy is cauterization with fire or a caustic medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two good things: burning that excess flesh.
And cutting the blood and drying the moisture. Then treat it with lint soaked in butter or sulfur powder mixed with oil until the area suppurates and that burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that grow firm flesh.
These are the medicines which have astringent and drying properties; for when it is conjoined, then it is healed, and there is no fear of recurrence. If the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is distant from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it a partition of peritoneum or flesh, and it is near to penetration, then the action in it is only by way of hope and expectation; that is, to use in it one of three methods: either to cauterize it as we have said.
Or to incise it until you reach its bottom, so that you can easily insert the lint and treat it from near. Do not overdo the incision, lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus and cause the patient to involuntarily pass stool. Then treat it as we have mentioned; perhaps it will heal as we have said.
Or to penetrate that partition and perforate it after you have incised it near to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or with another sharp-pointed instrument. Then cleanse all the adherent flesh in the incision as far as you can, thoroughly.
Then close the entire wound, together with the incision and the upper opening, until it is sealed, and the fistula remains open inside the anus; this will be easier for the patient.  The fistula may be perforated in this manner.
And if you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is on one side of the anus, towards the surface of the body with the skin and the circumference of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip, like a cobbler's needle, in this manner:
And insert into it a twisted thread of five threads or so. Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom, if it is perforated in the margin of the anus from inside, nearby.
Then bring the thread out through that opening by inserting your finger into the anus and bringing out the end of the thread. Bring both ends together and tighten them, and leave it for a day or two.  Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the thread is severed and falls away. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the fistula is not perforated, perforate it however you can, except that it should not be too deep, for you should not do that because of the muscle, lest you cut it. Then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.
The image of the hooked scalpel with which fistulas are incised: its curve is very sharp, and the other side is not sharp, lest you cut what is not needed, as you see.
Chapter eighty-one.
Concerning the opening of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the rectum, resembling red bladders or like grapes, and there are small and large ones, and blood constantly flows from them.
And they may be single or numerous, and they may be outside the rectum and at its edges, except that those which are outside the rectum are in most cases less moist, with a yellowish water or a little blood constantly flowing from them, and they are the color of the body.
The treatment of those that are inside the rectum is that you should order the patient to strain and bear down until the rectum comes out and the warts appear to you.  Then you quickly seize them with hooks or grasp them with your fingernail and cut them at their base.  If the hooks do not hold because of their moistness and laxity,
then rub them with a rough cloth or a piece of a rough sponge, or pull them with your fingers, then cut them. Then, after cutting, sprinkle on them some sharp powders to act as a cautery, or cauterize them as described in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If the rectum does not come out, inject the patient with an enema containing a little stimulant to wash what is in the rectum and make it come out quickly when the patient strains. As for the warts that are outside the rectum, their treatment is easy and simple.
That is, you take it with your fingernail or seize it with a hook and cut it, then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals. And whoever dislikes cutting with iron should use a thread in this way: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upwards and pass the needle through its base from the other side, and twist the ends of the thread below the needle while it is across, and pull the wart tightly, then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the warts and leave one unpierced.
so that the excess blood flows from it, then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or kyrios oil on the rectum and tell the patient to be still, then leave him until they fall off. When the warts fall off, treat them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often occur from dryness of the stool and retention of the temperament. If it becomes chronic and medicine does not work, then it should be scraped with the blade of a scalpel or with your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper crust that prevents it from healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more forcefully than before until it bleeds well and is excoriated, then treat it, for it will heal.
Chapter eighty-two.
On the treatment of ingrown and non-ingrown nails, dry warts, and the ant.
A corn is a round nodule, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail. It occurs on the whole body, especially on the soles of the feet and the toes, and causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to incise around the corn, grasp it with a hook or a forceps, and remove it from its root, then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it as explained previously in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, matted, round protrusion on the surface of the body.
They often appear on the hands of children.  Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it, or pierce it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off; and if you wish, cauterize it with fire or a caustic medicine, as previously explained.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts may be removed with the instrument which I have mentioned in the treatment of the ant. As for the ant, it is also a small, matted, thick protrusion on the surface of the body, going very deep; and if cold affects it, a sensation similar to the sting of ants is felt in it.
It occurs on the whole body, but mostly on the hands.  Its treatment is to take a tube made of a strong goose feather or eagle feather, and place this tube on the ant until the circumference of the tube surrounds it on all sides; then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the ant.
Then place it deep in the flesh, and the ant will be removed from its root. And if you wish, you may do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:
The top of the tube, towards the head, should be solid and wired so that the fingers may easily grasp and twist it. And if you wish, cauterize the ant as previously explained in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
On the shapes of the instruments used for injections in rectal ailments, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, china, or cast or hammered copper.  These instruments may be made in small and large sizes, according to the users. Those used in the treatment of small children, whose rectums are narrow or sore, should be very gentle. Image of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, to which the bladder is tied, is wide in this manner; it has a partition where the bladder is tied, as you see.  Its lower end, which enters the rectum, is solid, very smooth, and thin; on one side are two holes, and on the other, one hole.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of, or a little thicker than, a probe. The bladder, in which the medicines are placed, should be made from an animal's bladder or sheepskin, fashioned like a small pouch, its diameter being a span.
It is pierced with many holes in a circular pattern, the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger. Then, a strong thread of twisted yarn of ten strands or so is passed through these holes and gathers the bladder like a pouch. Then, when the medicine is placed inside, it is tightly bound at the head of the syringe between two stones, and then injected. This is an image of the circle of the bladder and the hole:
The method of injection is to fill the pouch or bladder with warmed medicine, to a degree the patient can tolerate; be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.  Then, the patient lies on his back and raises his legs.
A cloth or sheet is placed beneath him. Then, the tip of the syringe is lubricated with oil, egg white, fenugreek saliva, or the like, and gently inserted into the rectum. Then, an assistant takes the bladder in both hands and squeezes it strongly until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the bowel.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs against the wall. If the medicine stimulates evacuation, let him restrain himself as much as possible; if he sleeps the whole night with it, it will be more beneficial. If he is injected for diarrhea and evacuation is hastened, then repeat the injection until he is cured.
If there are painful hemorrhoids or tumors in the rectum, the syringe should be very gentle and smooth, smoother than those used for injecting children. This is an image of a gentle syringe with leather stretched over it:
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the treatment of wounds.
I have mentioned in the classification the treatment of what resembles cauterizations, and I will now discuss their treatment by hand and by medication completely. I say that wounds differ according to the thing that causes the wound and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The things that cause wounds are many, such as the blow of a stone, or a cut from a sword or knife, or a stab from a spear or stick or arrow, and so on from many things.
As for wounds according to their location on the body, there is the wound that occurs on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or liver, and similar organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measure and rule for all wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds especially because the compound ones will be mentioned at the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
So I say that when a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone, I look; and if it is from a blow of a stone or the like, and only the skin has been lacerated, and the wound is large, and I fear for the patient the occurrence of hot inflammation, then I hasten and open the cephalic vein in that place. And do not delay that, and let blood be drawn from him according to his strength if nothing prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood coming from the wound is little; and let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded area.
And warn the patient against fullness, and strong drinks and foods; and if something prevents him from being bled, then let him reduce his food and not approach meats or drinks. And apply to the wound, if hot inflammation occurs in it, cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with a drink that has an astringent quality.
And if you are safe from hot inflammation, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh and the air has not altered it, the powder which I will describe to you shortly; but if the air has altered it, then apply some ointments to it.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals. And if the wound is large, and is from a sword cut or the like, and its edges do not come together by themselves, then bring them together by stitching, as I describe in the stitching of abdominal wounds.
If the skin exposes the bone and hangs, and its attachment is only by a small piece, then cut it off, then treat the wound with medicines that produce firm flesh to replace the skin, and order the patient to be nourished by foods that have firmness, like heads and brains and the like.
If decay occurs in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the decayed part and throw it away, then treat it.  If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding blood and the bleeding does not stop with medication, then search for the artery.
If you find it and it is not severed, then sever it with the scalpel and tie it. And if necessity demands, if what we have mentioned is not effective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, then their treatment is easy and simple; it suffices to treat them by sprinkling this powder on them while they are bleeding.
before the air alters them. The preparation of the powder is that one part of frankincense, two parts of gum arabic, and three parts of slaked or unslaked lime are taken; all are crushed, sifted, and the wound is filled with it and firmly bandaged until it adheres well.
It will clot with the blood, then bandage it on top with a bandage and leave it; do not untie it as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not separate from it until it heals.  The lime alone may do this if you do not have frankincense and gum arabic.
This action may also be done with cobwebs in many large wounds if its application and bandaging are skillfully done, and the wounds are fresh with blood, before the air alters them, but if the air has altered them somewhat, especially if it is in summer.
then there is no benefit in applying this powder; treat it with what we have mentioned: apply some ripening ointments or apply a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey until pus is produced, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
But if a fracture of the bone occurs with the wound and it is slight, draw it with a splint. I have described the treatment of head fractures in what follows, in the surgery of the neck. If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment from a head wound if it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treating it with things that constrict strongly, like verdigris and vitriol and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause it to spasm.
And nothing cold should be placed on the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection is to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  What you treat it with should be soft medicines, like burnt alum washed with fresh water several times, moistened with oil or rose ointment and tutty.
If it is also washed with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments; but if the wound is large, use stitching or bind its edges with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has depth and a cavity forms in its lower part where pus collects, lance it in its lowest place. If an artery is severed in the wound and you see its blood flowing, ligate it or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx, and the vessels remain intact, join the edges of the skin with sutures over the windpipe, but do not touch the windpipe itself. Rather, straighten it and return it to its natural shape, then bind it tightly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, examine it; if there are bone splinters, extract all of them or as many as you can.  Those you cannot remove, leave them until the wound decays, heals, and their removal becomes easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on it the powder we described. If a bone in the wound decays and becomes fistulous, treat it as described in its chapter, in the surgery of the chest and between the shoulders.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife and you see that it has depth, look: if air emerges from it when the patient breathes, know that it is a mortal wound. If it does not have depth and is fresh with its blood, do not initially apply powder to it, nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be trapped in its depths.
It will then recede to the heart and kill the patient. But put on it an attractive ointment and dress it twice a day. If you do not have ointment, put a used cotton ball in the mouth of the wound to absorb the moisture that comes out of it, and have the patient sleep on the wound.
so that whatever gathers there may flow out.  If three days or more have passed since the injury and the patient has not experienced convulsions, bad palpitations, or shortness of breath, and you see his other conditions are good, then know that the wound is safe, and treat it with cauterization and other treatments until it heals.
If it is difficult to see it and the pus flows continuously, know that it has become fistulous, and treat it according to its chapter.  The patient should lie on the wound so that whatever gathers there may flow out. If it is a wound of the chest or back, treat it with the stitching described earlier.
If it is large, cauterize it; if small, use powder. If it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, explore the wound and promptly remove those fragments if they are free. If they are not free, leave them until...
the wound becomes putrid, for then it will be easier to remove them. As for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, their treatment is governed by what we have mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-five.
On abdominal wounds, the protrusion of the intestines, and their stitching.
The wound which occurs in the abdomen may be large, or it may be small or medium.  A large wound may allow the protrusion of one or several intestines, and returning them and stitching them is more difficult and strenuous.
A small wound may also be difficult in another way, requiring more strenuous effort to return the intestine.  If the intestine is not immediately returned to its place, it swells and thickens, making it difficult to replace.  For this reason, a medium-sized wound is preferable, because returning the intestine is not as difficult as with the other two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen is of four types: two are general, suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing other wounds of the body; the other two are specific, used for all wounds, but more especially for suturing the abdomen.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification. I say that if the wound is small and some of the intestine has protruded and its return is difficult, this is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we said, or because the intestine has been swollen by the cold air.
If this is so, then it should be warmed by dipping a sponge or a damp cloth into lukewarm water alone, or water in which dill, rue, and spikenard have been boiled, and applying it to the intestine until the swelling resolves.
A styptic drink may also do this, and it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.  If you see that the swelling has resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which alkanet or madder has been boiled, for it will facilitate its entry with the least effort.
If its return is still difficult after this treatment, then make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used to incise fistulas. The first treatment, if successful, is better than incision. Incision is only resorted to out of necessity and after other means have failed.  This is the image of the instrument:
One side is curved and limited, the other side is unlimited. The thin end is not as sharp as a scalpel, but is slightly blunt. It is an instrument resembling a small spatula, as you see. If the wound is widened and the intestine has entered, then it should be returned to its natural shape.
And its proper place, if you can manage it, is best. But if the wound is wide and is in the lower abdomen, then the patient should lie on his back with his legs higher than his head; if it is in the upper abdomen, then his head and chest should be higher than his lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always make the side with the injury higher than the other side. This should also be done in major and moderate surgeries.
As for minor wounds, position the patient as you are able. Then have a gentle assistant ready to hold the entire wound with both hands and bring the edges together, then reveal it to the person doing the stitching, piece by piece.
This is the description of a single common stitch: Take a needle, or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Then leave a space at the edge of the wound equal to the thickness of the little finger, and insert one needle without thread into the edges of the skin. along with the edges of the peritoneum under the skin from the inside, until you pass it through from that side.  You will have gathered the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, making four layers. Then, tie a doubled thread around the needle several times on both sides until the edges of the wound are tightly joined.
Then leave a space equal to the thickness of a finger, and insert another needle, then fasten it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with as many needles as you need until you complete the entire circumference of the wound.  Let the needles be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
For very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick needles are difficult to insert into the skin. Therefore, they should be of medium thickness.  And the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too close to the wound.
lest the flesh quickly tear and the wound open before it heals.  Nor should you be too far apart with the stitches, lest the wound fail to unite. Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient when he sleeps, and make for him pads of linen cloth on each side to hold the ends of the needles.
And leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of stitching with needles is most suitable for small wounds, because it may suffice to stitch them with one or two needles, or thereabouts.
As for the method of stitching for a common wound, it is that you bring together the four edges—that is, the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum—at once with a needle threaded with a twisted thread of moderate thickness, then when the needle has passed through these four edges, return the needle to the same side from which you began.
So that the thread lies interwoven from the top of the wound, so that the stitching is like the stitching of a purse with which goods are tied, and make the distance between each stitch the width of the little finger.  This stitching is known to all people.
With this stitching, I stitched a wound that appeared on a man in his abdomen. He had been wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a span long.  About two spans of the middle intestine had protruded, and the wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
Then I replaced it after his intestines had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he was healed. He lived many years afterward, managing all his affairs, while the physicians had judged that he would not recover at all.
And what is remarkable is that I did not treat him with ointment, because I was in a place where there were no medicines.  I used to place worn cotton on the wound twice a day and treat it by washing it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two types of special stitching, I mention it according to Galen's words: you begin the stitching from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside.  When the needle has passed through the skin and the muscle going straight along the whole length of the abdomen.
I left the edge of the peritoneum on the side into which I inserted the needle, and I passed the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, into the other edge of the intestines. When I had passed it through, I passed it again through this same edge of the intestines from outside to inside.
And leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, and as you pass it through, pass it through the peritoneum to the edge of the intestine on its side until it passes completely through it.
Then begin again from this same side and sew it together with the edge of the peritoneum on the other side, and bring the needle out of the skin near it. Then return it into that skin and sew the edge of the peritoneum on the other side together with this edge of the intestine.
And bring it out of the skin on its side, and do that again and again, one after another, until you sew up the whole wound in that way.  In short, the description of this stitch is that you sew it like the stitching of furriers for fur.
That you sew the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin and leave it once from the other side until you finish. As for the second type of special stitching which Galen also mentioned, this is his exact wording.
Which is that you sew it in the manner that some physicians sew, by joining each part to its counterpart similar to it by nature, thus joining the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the intestine to its other edge, which is as I describe to you.
It is necessary that you insert the needle into the edge of the intestine nearest to you from the outside, and pass it to the inside in it alone, and leave the edges of the peritoneum. Then return the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside in both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again.
And pass it from the inside to the outside in the edge of the other intestine which is on the opposite side. This type of stitch is better than the easy common stitch, which is the stitch previously mentioned. This is Galen's exact wording. Some have said that the suturing of the abdomen may be done with two needles. That is, you insert a single thread into them, and begin by inserting the needle from your side and passing it to the other side, and insert the other needle from the opposite side, then pass it from your side according to the stitching of the mattress stitch.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suturing is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its treatment is governed by the rules of treatment of other wounds.  That is, if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air alters it, and you have returned the intestine and stitched and tightened it, then apply to it the medicated lint.
If the wound has been altered by the air, then apply to it some of the ointments that you have prepared until it suppurates and the stitches fall out and the peritoneum and intestine adhere, then treat it like you treat other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, then apply to it, from when it begins to suppurate, old cotton, and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals. For you do not need further treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple. If you fear that the wound might involve the principal organs in pain,
then it is necessary that you dip soft wool into moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and the armpit. If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines—and this often occurs—then inject him with a lukewarm astringent black drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and become a penetrating wound into its cavity. And know that what is thick of the intestines is easier to heal, and what is thin of them is more difficult to heal.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not readily heal from a wound at all, because of the multitude and size of its veins and the thinness of its substance and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. But if what protruded from the wound was the omentum, and you caught it fresh, then return it in the same way as you return the intestine.
If a period of time has passed and it has turned green or black, then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the part that has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for the omentum contains veins and arteries, then cut below that ligature.
And leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, outside of it, so that it is easy for you to remove and extract it when the omentum falls off and the wound suppurates.  Concerning wounds that occur in the intestine: if a small perforation occurs in the intestine,
it may heal in some people, because I saw a man who had been wounded in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach. The wound became chronic and formed a fistula from which feces and flatus emerged; and I treated it, although I did not hope for its healing. I continued to treat him until it healed and the place closed. When I saw that the place had closed, I feared for the patient that some bad accident might occur in his abdomen, but no bad accident occurred to him at all, and he remained in the best of health. He eats and drinks properly, engages in sexual intercourse, enters the bath, and exercises in his service. Some experienced people have said that if a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be sutured in this manner.
Large-headed ants are taken, then the edges of the wound are brought together, and one of these ants, with its mouth open, is placed on the edges of the wound. When it bites and tightens its mouth, its head is cut off; then it sticks and does not come undone. Then another ant is placed near the first.
This is done repeatedly with several ants, according to the size of the wound. Then it is bandaged and stitched, and those heads remain stuck in the intestine until the intestine heals and recovers. No harm at all occurs to the patient.  The intestine can also be stitched with fine thread.
Which is drawn from the intestine of the animal adhering to it after it has been passed through a needle. The end of this thread is taken from the intestine, then it is gently drawn out and a thin, twisted linen thread is tied to its end; then this thread is passed through the needle. And in it is the intestine's thread, with which the intestine is stitched, then it is returned to the abdomen. This type of suturing with ants and intestine is only by way of hope and expectation.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no remedy and no healing at all.
Chapter Eighty-six.
In the treatment of catarrh and fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and protracted and becomes an ulcer and does not heal, and constantly discharges pus that does not stop, is generally called, in whatever member it may be, a fistula, and we call it a catarrh, and a fistula.
It is, in reality, a hardened, matted, white mass, without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather; and it is sometimes moist, constantly discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture may cease; and this moisture may be abundant or scanty, thick or thin.
And I have already stated in the classification, when mentioning wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal and in which flesh does not grow is due to one of nine causes; one of which is either paucity of blood in the body, or its poor quality, or because there is within it and on its edges hard flesh which prevents the growth of good flesh. Or because it is very painful and dirty; or because the ulcer itself is foul and the matter it discharges is of poor quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment; or because of a corruption occurring in the region of the nature of an epidemic; or because of a peculiar quality in the region.
Or because it is very painful and dirty; or because the ulcer itself is foul and the matter it discharges is of poor quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment; or because of a corruption occurring in the region of the nature of an epidemic; or because of a peculiar quality in the region. As was evident in the city of Saragossa, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is naturally slow; or because there is a single bone or several bones in it.  I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the classification.
It is necessary here that I inform you of the treatment of fistula and abscess which is done by hand surgery. Know that fistulas may occur in all parts of the body; some of them terminate in large veins and arteries or in a nerve.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib of the ribs, or to a vertebra of the vertebrae of the back, or to a joint of the compound joints, such as the hand and the foot; and some of them lead to the vicinity of a principal organ and so forth.
Now, those fistulas which are of this kind are among the difficult-to-cure diseases which do not accept treatment and working on them is difficult and ignorant. If there are fistulas which have not reached these places which I mentioned, and I hoped and expected their treatment,
And you wished to arrive at knowledge of that, then take a probe of copper or iron. If the fistula runs straight, examine it with this. If there is a bend in the fistula, examine it with a probe of thin lead, for lead is soft in its body.
It will thus be easy to enter and bend towards the bend. If the fistula has many openings, you cannot determine them with the probe. Inject one of its openings, then the moisture which you inject will proceed towards the other openings and flow.
Then thoroughly investigate in whichever way you can to know if there is a bone or nerve, or if the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a single fistula with many openings.  Ascertain all this to the extent of your ability by questioning the patient and noting the pain when you touch the place.
And similar signs and causes of the swelling. If you ascertain all this truthfully, then proceed to treatment with confidence. That is, you should consider whether...
The fistula is apparent and near, or in a safe place far from a joint or nerve or artery or vein or one of the places I mentioned to you, then incise the fistula as I described and remove from it the accretion and the corrupt flesh and the excess flesh.
And whatever grows in its opening of flesh or wart and the like, and treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep and straight, then you should incise it deeply as much as possible, then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh.
Then use a twisted thread soaked in strong medicines and insert it into the bottom of the fistula which you can reach with an instrument. Do this repeatedly until that strong medicine eats away all that remains of corruption in the bottom of the fistula.
Then treat it with ointments that grow healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal with this, cauterize it as previously described. If the cause of the fistula is bone and that is clear to you, then probe it and incise it as I told you, if nothing prevents you from.
A nerve, or a major organ, as we said. If the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with what will heal it until it heals. If it does not heal and the pus continues as it was doing.
Know that you have not reached complete removal of the corruption.  Expose all of it again and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it to the best of your ability, then dress it. If it heals, otherwise know that that corruption is in a deep recess. Expose all of it again.
And thoroughly scrape and cleanse it to the best of your ability. If the corrupted bone is small and you can pull it out, then pull it out with fine forceps suitable for that purpose.
If there are many bones, thoroughly extract them all and do not leave any behind to the best of your ability. If something of the ligaments obstructs you, and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and the flesh if it is there, and extract the bones.
If you cannot extract the bones immediately, apply something to the wound that will cause it to fester, and leave it for several days until it festers what is around those bones of flesh and ligaments. Keep the wound from healing the incision that you made during your work.
Rather, if you fear that, place upon it cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For when it festers those ligaments and loosens the bones, it will be easy to extract and pull them out.
If it is a single large bone, such as a bone of the leg or thigh bone, and so on, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption disappears, then dress the wound. If a large part of it is corrupted and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it.
And cut it all away to where the corruption ends. Then treat it until it heals. And I will tell you of a case of gangrene which occurred in a man's leg, to serve as an example and aid for your treatment. This man was young.
About thirty years old, he suffered pain in his leg due to something moving within his body until the materials reached the leg and it swelled greatly. There was no external cause. Then time passed, along with the mistakes of the doctors, until the swelling opened.
And much material flowed from it, and he was poorly treated until the leg became gangrenous and many openings appeared in it, all discharging pus and the body's humors. A group of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one among them skilled in surgery.
Until they consulted me. I saw his leg and the material flowing from those openings in great abundance, and the man's body was emaciated and his color yellow.  Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
And I found them leading to each other from all sides of the leg. So I began by incising one of those openings until I exposed some of the bone. And I found it corrupt, eaten away, blackened, putrefied, and perforated until the hole penetrated to the marrow.  Then I opened up what was revealed to me.
And I reached the corrupted bone. I believed that there was no corruption in the bone other than what I had cut and opened, and that I had excised it. Then I proceeded to dress the wound with cauterizing medications for a longer period, but it did not heal. Then I returned and exposed the bone again, beyond the first exposure.
And I found the corruption continuous with the bone. Then I opened up what was also revealed to me of that corruption. Then I attempted to dress it, but it did not heal nor unite. Then I examined it again, and I continued to cut away the bone piece by piece and attempt to heal it, but it would not heal, until I had cut away about a span of bone.
And I removed it with its marrow. Then I dressed it with medications, and it healed quickly and recovered.  This repetition in its operation and incision was necessary because of the weakness of the patient, his low tolerance, and my fear for his death, because he frequently experienced severe fainting from excessive vomiting.  He recovered completely.
And in the place of the bone, firm flesh grew, and his condition in his body improved, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs, and in walking he did not suffer any harm whatsoever.  If a prominent bone in a part of the body is broken...
Then it should be opened in this manner: you take a ligature and tie it around the end of the prominent bone, and you instruct someone to pull it upwards, and you make another ligature of thicker wool than the first ligature.
Then you tie it around the flesh beneath the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards, and you expose the flesh from the place that you wish to open so that the saw does not injure the flesh, and you place a piece of wood or a board firmly beneath the bone from below.
Because if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupt bone.  The sawing should be done a little above the place of corruption, lest there be corruption in the cavity of the bone which does not appear on its surface to the touch, so that you are obliged to saw it again.
If the bone is corrupt and not prominent, but its parts are joined together, and the corruption is in its middle or in some part of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides. Then place the piece of wood underneath, and then saw it from the first side where the corruption is.
When you have finished sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little distance from the corruption, as we have said. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupt joint itself and saw the bone where it joins from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy except excision. If the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or foot, the treatment is very difficult, but you should peel away the corruption however it appears to you, and excise it and cleanse it in any way you can.
And by whatever method it is straightened for you, provided a vein or nerve does not obstruct you. And know that the instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their arrangement, their thickness and thinness, their size and smallness, their hardness and porosity. Therefore, for each type of work, one should prepare an instrument similar to that work.
Know that the operations themselves may indicate to you the type of instrument you need, if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this profession, for that is from the mastery of the profession and witnessing many types of diseases. He may therefore devise for himself instruments similar to those for each disease, and I have depicted for you at the end of this chapter several instruments.
Making them examples to be followed and a measure by which you measure others, God willing. Image of a saw:

Chapter eighty-seven.
In the amputation of limbs and the sawing of bones.
The limbs may become putrid, either from an external cause or from an internal cause. If you treat that corruption with medicinal treatment and the treatment is not effective, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing restraining it,
it is necessary to amputate that member to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved thereby from death or from a great calamity which is greater than the loss of the member. And a sign of this happening to someone is that the member turns black, so that you think that fire has burned it.
Or it may fester after the blackness, until that festering spreads to what is next to that member and attacks the whole body. Then hasten to cut it off.  Likewise, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of some insects, such as a sea scorpion, or a snake, or a tarantula, and the like.
If the corruption or the sting is in the tip of a finger, amputate the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.  Likewise, if it has taken hold in the hand, amputate it from the base of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it takes hold in the forearm of the arm.
Likewise, if it has taken hold in the arm, amputate the arm at the elbow in the joint itself. If the corruption spreads and you see it has reached towards the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient.  Use other treatments as much as possible.
And likewise you do with the leg: if the corruption takes hold in the toe, amputate the toe at one of the joints; and if it takes hold in the instep, amputate the whole foot; and if it ascends to the knee, amputate the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no recourse but to leave it and leave the patient to death. The method of amputating or excising a member is to tie a ligature below the place you wish to cut off, and to tie another ligature above the place.
And one assistant pulls the lower ligature downwards, and another assistant pulls the upper ligature upwards, and you yourself dissect the flesh between the ligatures with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then it is cut or excised. It is necessary that you place linen cloths on all sides.
Lest the saw touch the healthy part, which would cause the patient excessive pain and hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, staunch the place quickly, or apply some styptic, then return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the wounded member with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I will tell you about an example of a man who suffered this very condition in his leg, that is, a blackness appeared in his leg with a burning sensation like fire.
And this corruption first appeared in his toe until it took the whole leg. So the man, seeing the corruption spreading in his limb, with the intensity of pain and burning he felt, cut it off at the joint and healed.
Then, after a long time, the same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand. He came to me, and I tried to restrain that corruption with the medicines I applied to the hand after cleansing his body, but the corruption did not abate and continued to spread to the other finger.
Until the corruption seized the hand, and he asked me to cut off his hand. I refused, hoping to restrain the corruption, and I also feared for his life if I cut off his hand, because the man's strength was failing.  When he despaired of me, he returned to his town.
Then I heard that he himself cut off his entire hand and healed.  I have recounted this story to be helpful in cases of this type of disease, and to serve as a guide to be followed and acted upon.
Chapter Eighty-eight.
On the treatment of fistulas and how to inject them with medicines.
If a swelling occurs in one of the fleshy organs, and the duration of the swelling is prolonged until it gathers matter, then bursts or is incised, and all the matter within it comes out, leaving the place empty like a vessel.
And the skin over it is like a rag, thinned, and its corruption has not affected the bone, nerve or ligament. Therefore, it deserves to be called a fistula, and not a sinus, unless its duration is prolonged until the corruption affects one of these organs.
Then it is called a sinus or fistula, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin completely, as it extends, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and its corruption has not reached that extent, and there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with injection. This is done by looking at the fistula; if it is large and the pus that flows from it is foul-smelling, then inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris in equal parts, mixed in a vessel and cooked over the fire until the medicine thickens and reaches the consistency of honey. Then take what you need and dilute it with water and honey, and inject the fistula with it, and bind its opening, and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then remove it by pressing; do this for several days until the fistula is cleansed and the foul smell is gone.  It may also be injected with ash water if this medicine is not available. This is made by taking the ash of grapevine wood or oak wood and pouring water over it.
Then strain it and inject it until you are certain that the fistula has been washed. If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then inject it with water and honey in which some powdered verdigris has been mixed.
Or inject it with honey and wine mixed together, for honey cleanses and washes, and wine closes the fistula, especially if the wine has astringent and drying properties. When you have done this several times and are sure that the fistula's corruption has gone, inject it with something that will cause flesh to grow in it.
Such as taking palm ointment and dissolving it in rose oil and astringent wine, or injecting it with some of the other medicines and ointments whose descriptions we have given in the chapter on ointments. If the opening of the fistula is narrow and does not allow for the injection tube,
widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place in it a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment or theriac ointment until it widens.  Similarly, if the opening is wide, bring its edges together with sutures, leaving only enough space for the injection tube and no more.
Similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is high up, incise it in the lowest part so that the pus flows downwards; for if the pus is trapped in the depth of the fistula, it prevents the growth of flesh.
If you cannot incise the fistula downwards as you wish, then position the limb so that the pus flows out easily, as best you can, so that none of the pus is retained at all.
As for the emollient medicines that are applied externally to the fistula and the method of applying them, take one of the emollient ointments appropriate to your purpose and spread it on a linen cloth; the cloth should be large enough to cover the entire fistula. Then, with scissors, make a hole opposite the opening of the fistula, slightly larger than the fistula opening.  Then spread some emollient ointment on another cloth, to the size of the hole, and place it there, somewhat away from the opening of the fistula, to facilitate the exit of pus. Do not remove the large cloth until later.
several days; as for the one on the opening of the fistula, remove it at all times so that what has collected there of pus may come out, and to see what flows from it of pus, whether it is much or little, mature or immature.
Also, examine the fistula itself: does the patient feel pain in it, or not, and is there swelling or not? If your treatment continues thus and you see that the matter that comes out is little at the opening of the fistula.
Know that the fistula has adhered or is close to adhering. Then, resolve it the next day or the third day. When you open the wound, change the cloths and renew the ointment. If, after a long time, thin pus comes out of the fistula, do not despair of its closure.
Its healing is near, for some people are slow in the growth of flesh in their wounds, and others the opposite. If, after many days, immature pus comes out of the fistula, know that the fistula has not closed. If the closure of the fistula is slow,
and its matter is prolonged, increase the drying medications, and let them be medications that are moist in their consistency and dry in their strength, like date-palm ointment if an excess of litharge has been added to it. Among the most effective things to treat it with is to take date-palm ointment.
and dissolve it with rose oil and sprinkle on it old wine, moderate in consistency, then knead it with it and use it.  He may do something similar if date-palm ointment is not available: honey, if you cook it until it thickens and use it; or take myrrh, aloes, and costus, crush everything, and sprinkle it on the honey while it is on the fire. Then apply it on a cloth and bind it to the fistula, or apply it with the honey that you cooked until it thickens, and sprinkle on it the medicaments, and place on it the cloths and bind it.
Long zedoary, the root of the asphodel,  the flour of the  cress and the centaury may be used in such a case, singly or together. Crush them, sift them, and sprinkle them on the honey described and use it. If the matter of the fistula is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth.
And if it has affected the bones, or other hard nerves, or ligaments, treat it as a fistula, as previously described.
Chapter eighty-nine.
On the treatment of the felon, the diseased nail, the cutting of the excess finger, and the separation of adherent fingers.
A felon is an excessive amount of flesh that grows under the toenail or fingernail, and it may grow in the other fingers. If its duration is prolonged and its treatment is neglected, it swells into a hot tumor.
Or it becomes putrid and foul until it eats the root of the nail, and perhaps it spoils the whole nail, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone until it has a foul odor and the tip of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes livid.  If you treat it with what we mentioned in the division and your treatment does not work,
it is necessary to cut with an iron instrument all the excess that grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound afterward; for cauterization is very beneficial in this. And as for if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy,
and the corner containing the nail had constricted the flesh inward and caused it to be pinched and injured, it is necessary to place a thin pledget under the corner of the nail which pinches the flesh and raise it upward and cut that flesh gently.
And you place on what remains of the flesh of the cauterizing corrosive medicines until it is all gone, then you treat it with ointments until it heals. And as for if the corruption has affected the bone, it is necessary to cut that bone and remove it, for it will not heal as long as there is corrupt bone at all.
If you see the corrosion and corruption spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of the joints as previously mentioned, then treat it until it heals. If the nail receives a blow or injury and severe pain occurs in it, it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Then you incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, an oblique incision from above to below, and be careful not to reach with the incision to the flesh under the nail, for by that you cause the patient severe pain and it will be a cause for the growth of excess flesh in the place, then treat the place with that which calms pains.
As for the supernumerary finger which develops in some people's hands, perhaps it is entirely fleshy, and perhaps it has bones in some of it, and perhaps it has a nail in it, and the growth of some of them is at the base of the joint of some fingers.
Or its growth is in some of the joints of the finger, and that which grows in some of the joints of the finger does not move, and that which grows at the joint of the finger perhaps moves.  As for that which is only fleshy, its cutting is easy, and that is to cut it at its base with a wide scalpel.
As for that whose growth is at the base of the joint, its treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting it. As for that which grows in the finger at one of the joints, it is necessary to first cut its flesh in a circular cut to the bone, then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the adhesion which occurs to the fingers, some of them to some, that often occurs, and that is from that with which a person is born, and it is at the healing of a wound or a burn of fire and the like. Then it is necessary to incise that adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural form, then place between them a pledget or a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil, lest it quickly adhere, and separate them, or place a thin lead plate between them until the place heals as it should.
And likewise, if adhesion occurs to some of the fingers with the palm, then incise that adhesion according to what is suitable and improves the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On cutting off polyps.
Polyps are thick, twisted veins filled with dark, superfluous humors, occurring in most parts of the body, most frequently in the legs, especially in the legs of those who carry weights and burdens.  First, it is necessary to vigorously rub the body with black hellebore.
Then bleed the patient in the basilic vein. As for treating them with iron, there are two methods: one is to incise and remove the black blood; the other is to extract the entire vein.  As for incision, the leg should first be bathed in warm water.
until the thick, turbid blood is dissolved. Then the patient's leg is bound from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage, and the vein is incised in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then extract the black blood with your hand from below the leg upwards and from above downwards, until you have removed the amount you deem sufficient, or what the patient's strength can bear. Then bind it and instruct him to avoid foods that produce black bile, and repeat purging and bloodletting.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient.  As for extraction, this is how it is done: shave the patient's leg if there is a lot of hair, then take him to the bathhouse and bathe his leg in warm water until it reddens and sweats, or have him perform vigorous exercise.
If a bathhouse is not available, heat the limb. Then incise the skin over the vein lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or at its lower part near the heel. Then open the skin with hooks and peel the vein from each side until it is palpable.
When it appears, you will see it is dark red; once freed from the skin, it appears like a tendon. Then insert a probe under it until it rises and emerges from the skin, and suspend it with a smooth, blind hook. Then make another incision near that incision, about three fingers wide.
Then peel the skin from over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the probe as you did before and suspend it with another hook as you did initially. Then make another incision, or many incisions if necessary.
Then extract it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel. Then pull and extract it until it emerges from the second incision. Then pull it to the incision above it and do this until you pull it from the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, until when all of it emerges, cut it.
If it does not yield to pulling and extraction, insert a needle with strong doubled thread, tie it, and pull. Insert the probe underneath and twist it with your hand to each side until it emerges. Take care that it does not break; if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to extract it.
And some harm enters the patient from it.  When you have extracted it entirely, place wool soaked in a potion and rose oil or olive oil on the wounds and treat it until it heals. If the varix is convoluted, with twists and turns in various directions,
and not straight as we said, then it is necessary to make incisions on it at each part of its convolutions and points of twisting, then suspend it with hooks until you extract it completely.  Take care when incising it that you do not cut or injure the vein, for it will be difficult for you to extract it, so exert yourself carefully.
Image of the incision used to incise the varix:
Image of the blind hook:
It should not be hooked like other hooks, nor should it be sharp-pointed, lest it injure the vein. It should be thick, smooth, and curved, for if it is thin it will cut the vein with its thinness; rather it should have a considerable thickness, as we said.
Chapter Ninety-One.
On the removal of the urban varix.
This varix develops in the legs in hot countries like the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs, and in hot, barren lands with little fertility.  It may also develop in other parts of the body besides the legs, and its development is due to an infection that occurs under the skin.
As happens with living creatures and worms inside the bodies, and gourd-like swellings and worms that develop between the skin and flesh, the sign of the beginning of this varix is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the area ulcerates, and then the varix begins to emerge from the site of that ulceration.
It is as if it were the root of a plant or animal.  When its tip appears, it should be wrapped with a small piece of lead weighing from one to two drachms, and tied, leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever something emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut some of it and wrap the remainder. Do not cut it from its root before it has all emerged, for if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing a swelling and infection in the area and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be managed and pulled out little by little until it is completely removed and nothing of it remains in the body.  From this varix, in some people, something may emerge that is five or ten cubits in length.
It has been reported to me that twenty cubits emerged from a man. If it breaks off while you are treating it, insert a probe into its hole and gently probe it along the body until all its matter is emptied, then try to disinfect the area with medications for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors. This varix may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or in the leg itself, resulting in many openings, and from each opening a branch emerges. Treat it as we mentioned in the classification and as previously described.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Concerning the incision for worms generated under the armpit, called the cow's disease.
This disease is called in some of our countries the cow's disease because it frequently affects cows. It is a single small worm that is generated between the skin and the flesh, and moves throughout the body, ascending and descending.
It is perceived by touch as it moves from one member to another until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges. Its formation is from the corruption of some humors, as happens with worms, snakes, and the gourd-like growth in the abdomen.
The harm to be expected from it is that if it moves in the body and ascends to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it and emerge, destroying the eye. This happens frequently. If you wish to treat it and remove it, that is done when it moves and becomes perceptible to the touch.
It is necessary to tie tightly above and below it with a strong ligature, then incise it and remove it. If it has sunk into the flesh and you do not find it, apply cautery with fire to the area until you burn it. The greatest harm to be expected from it is its damage to the eye, as we have said.
If you see it has reached the head near the eye, tie tightly below it on the forehead, then incise and remove it.  The patient should be treated with purgatives to cleanse the body of bad, putrid humors, and should abstain from foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
Concerning the incision for the disease known as the gnawing ulcer.
This disease, which in our country is called *an-nafir*, is a pain that appears in some organs, then moves from one organ to another. I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in the countryside. She bared her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the forearm. After a short while, I saw that swelling moving along the ulna like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
When it moved from one place to another, the pain disappeared from that place and settled in the shoulder. Then, after a while, it ran throughout the body until it reached the other arm.  Then she told me that it circulated through her whole body, as I witnessed.
I was amazed by the speed of its movement from one organ to another. I had never before seen this disease with my own eyes in this way, except that I had seen many people whose pain moved from one organ to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.
I could only explain it by the fact that the woman was a country dweller, with a dry body and exposed veins; therefore, that moving wind was perceptible.  It would not appear in the same way in people of comfort and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels pain, and if it appears to you visibly as we have mentioned, then tie above and below it tightly with a bandage, and incise it so that the contained wind escapes, and cauterize the place.
If you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by means of things that dispel and disperse the winds, such as the seeds of  *menten* and *sakbij* and similar medicines.
Chapter ninety-four.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the places in the body where they lodge. As for their differences according to their types, there are large and small ones, hollow glass ones and solid glass ones, and some have three points and others four.
Some have barbs and some have splinters. As for those according to the organs in which they lodge, they are of two kinds: either the organs are hollow principal organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like; if an arrow has lodged in one of these organs and you see the signs of death which I shall describe to you later, then you should avoid extracting that arrow from it, for death will overtake its owner in most cases. But if these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has not disappeared into the depth of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  Among the signs [of injury to] the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane which is over the brain, then there will result from that a severe headache, stupor, and dizziness.
But if these bad signs do not appear and the arrow has not disappeared into the depth of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  Among the signs [of injury to] the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane which is over the brain, then there will result from that a severe headache, stupor, and dizziness. and redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, and convulsions, and confusion of mind, and vomiting; and perhaps blood will come out from the nostrils or ears; and perhaps speech will cease and the voice will be lost; and there will come from the place of the wound a white moisture resembling gruel, and there flows from it something like the water of flesh.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and from extracting the arrow if it has not been extracted. As for the signs [of an arrow] if it strikes the heart and is near the left breast, and one feels it as if it has penetrated into something solid and not into something hollow;
and perhaps the arrow will have a movement resembling the movement of the pulse, and black blood will flow from the wound; and coldness of the extremities and cold sweat and fainting will follow; then know that death is inevitably approaching. And a sign of the arrow if it wounds the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound.
And the vessels which are near the neck will swell, and the color of the patient will change, and he will breathe with a high breath, and he will seek to inhale cold air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm which is in the chest, then it will be near the small ribs, and the breathing will be great with severe pain.
And he will sigh and all the members of the shoulders will move. And if the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain will follow, and blood will come out from the wound which resembles the liver in its redness. And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food will come out from the wound.
And its matter is apparent. And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and is fixed in it, and something of the stool or fat or intestine which has been perforated comes out from the wound, then there is no hope in its treatment or in extracting the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder and the urine comes out;
and something protrudes from it to the outside, and the pain becomes severe for the patient, then know that he is doomed. As for the other members, like the face, the eye, the throat, the shoulder, the arm, the vertebrae of the back, the clavicle, the thigh, the leg, and similar members, they are mostly safe.
When the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned. And I tell you some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may deduce from that your treatment. And that is that an arrow once struck a man in the corner of his eye at the root of the nose.
Then I extracted it for him from the other side under the lobe of the ear, and he recovered and nothing bad happened to his eye. And I extracted another arrow for a Jew which had struck him in the lobe of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had been hidden, and I grasped only its small end which is attached to the wood.
And it was a large arrow from the composite bows, square-headed, smooth, without barbs.  The Jew recovered, and no harm befell his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic.
And it is the one with two barbs.  So I made an incision for him between the two jugular veins, and it had sunk into his throat. So I gently manipulated it until I extracted it, and the Christian was safe and recovered.  And I extracted another arrow for a man which had struck him in his abdomen, and we judged that he would die from it.
Then when thirty days or so had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition, I made an incision over the arrow and maneuvered it and extracted it, and he recovered and no harm befell him. And I saw a man whom an arrow had struck in his back, and the wound had closed over it.
Then after seven years the arrow emerged at the root of her thigh. And I saw a woman who had been struck in her abdomen by an arrow, and the wound had closed, and the arrow remained. Nothing changed in her condition, nor did she experience any harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man whom an arrow had struck in his face, and the wound closed, and he felt little pain from it. And there are many similar cases. And I extracted an arrow for a man from the Sultan's guard which had struck him in the middle of his nose, inclining slightly to the right.
And the entire arrow was hidden. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck. I found the wound of the arrow very narrow, so I explored it with a thin probe, but I did not feel it. He felt a stinging pain under his ear on the right side of the incision.
I hoped that this stinging pain was from the tip of the arrow, so I applied a dressing with drawing and ripening power, hoping that the area would swell and the sign of the arrow would appear, so I could make an incision. But nothing happened in the area to indicate that the arrow had reached there.
I continued the dressing for many days, but nothing happened. Then the wound closed, and the patient despaired of its removal for a time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and told me. I then applied a strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it, and I felt the thin tip of the arrow that adheres to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that strong medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared before our eyes.  And it took me about four months with this.
Then, when the wound widened and I was able to insert the forceps into it, I pulled and moved it, but it did not respond to removal.  I continued to gently manipulate it and devise methods with various instruments until one day I grasped it firmly with forceps, as its image is shown at the end of the chapter.
And the physicians judged that the cartilage of his nose would not heal, but I healed it, and the wound joined and the patient recovered completely, without any further harm. And I tell you the method of removing some arrows so that you may use this as a measure and guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts and details of this craft cannot be grasped by description, nor encompassed by a book.  Rather, the skillful craftsman infers from the little to the much, and from what is present to what is absent, and devises a new action and a new instrument in the case of unusual occurrences.
If we turn to this craft, I say that arrows are removed from the members in which they are lodged in two ways: either by pulling them from the place where they entered, or from the opposite direction; and those that are removed from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy place, so it is pulled and removed. If it does not yield to removal at the time it is encountered, then you should leave it for some days until the flesh around it decays, so that it is easier to pull and remove it.  The same applies if it is lodged in bone.
And if it does not yield to removal, leave it also for some days and attempt to pull and move it every day, for it will come out.  If it does not yield to removal after some days, then you should bore around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine borer, until you widen the space for the arrow, then pull and remove it.
If the arrow lodged in the bone of the head has penetrated deeply into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those symptoms I have mentioned to you appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until its condition improves after some days.
then proceed to pull out and remove the arrow. If it is very firmly lodged and does not yield to pulling, use the borers around the arrow as I have described to you, then treat the place until it heals.  But if the arrow has disappeared into a place in the body, and is hidden from sensation, then probe for it with a probe. If you feel it, pull it out with some instruments suitable for pulling it out. If you cannot reach it because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is neither bone, nor nerve, nor vein there,
then incise it until the wound is widened and you can reach the arrow so that you may remove it. If it has barbs, grasp them, and free the flesh caught in them from every side by every means you can. If you cannot free the flesh, break the barbs and twist them until you free them.
And when you try to remove the arrow from whatever place it may be, use the twisting of your hand with forceps in all directions until you free it. Be extremely gentle lest the arrow break and it becomes difficult for you to pull it out and remove it. If you cannot manage it at the time,
leave it for some days until the flesh around it putrefies, then return to it; it will then be easier. If bleeding occurs, use what we have mentioned in its chapter. Carefully avoid cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use skill.
By every means you can, free the arrow; let this be done gently, slowly, and firmly, as I have described to you.  It is necessary that, when pulling out the arrow, you position the patient in the same way he was when the arrow struck; this is the most appropriate.
If you cannot do this, use whatever positions you can. As for an arrow that exits on the opposite side, either some of it will have emerged externally, or you will feel the tip of the arrow through the skin nearby, and see that it is protruding.
Make an incision over it, and let the incision be large enough for the forceps. Then pull it out, for it will be easy to remove. If it is stuck in a bone, twist your hand in a circular motion until the arrow affects the bone and makes a space for itself, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for some days, then return to it until it comes out. If the arrow shaft is still present, push it with it. If the shaft has fallen off and you want to use pushing, insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the tail of the arrow, then push it with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that enters that cavity; the arrow will then easily come out. If the arrow is poisoned, it is necessary that you cut away all the flesh where the poison has penetrated, if you are able to do so, then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the flank, and it is near enough to be felt with a probe, and you can make an incision over it, then make an incision, being careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if it needs stitching, and treat it until it heals.  Image of the forceps with which arrows are extracted:
Their ends are like the beak of a bird; they are made like a file, so that when they grasp the arrow or anything else, they do not let go.  Various sizes, large, small and medium, are made, each according to the size of the arrow, the width of the wound, and its narrowness.
Image of the hollow pusher:
Image of the solid pusher:
This has a solid end like an awl, to make it easier to insert into the hollow arrow and push it.
Chapter ninety-five.
On phlebotomy.
The veins usually opened in the body number thirty; of these, sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the “whispering” veins, and the two arteries in the temples which are visible, and the two veins at the inner canthus of the eyes, known as the “seeing” veins.
And the vein erect in the middle of the forehead, and the vein at the tip of the nose, and the two jugular veins in the neck, and the two veins in the upper lip, and the two veins in the lower lip—these veins are known as the “four,” and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins opened in the arm and hand, they are five: one is the cephalic, which is on the outer side and the common people call it the vein of the head; and the median, which is the middle vein and is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the basilic, which is situated on the inner side and is also called the axillary, and the common people call it the vein of the abdomen; and the vein of the forearm, which is situated on the ulna, to which it adheres, and which appears clearly above the thumb, and the azygos.
And this is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger; it has two branches. And in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is that which is below the hollow of the knee on the outer side; the second is the saphenous, and its place is at the heel on the inner side; and the sciatic vein, and its place is at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three similar veins. As for the two veins behind the ears, the benefit of opening them is for chronic colds, migraine, and ringworm, and chronic bad sores of the head, and the manner of opening them is as I describe.
And that is to shave the head of the patient and rub the back of his head in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, rubbing well; then the patient's neck is constricted with a turban until the two veins and their position appear behind the ears in the two low places of the head; then you examine them with your finger, and wherever you feel their pulsation under your finger there you mark with ink.
Then you take a lancet, which is known as the *nashshal*, and you insert it under the vein in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone; then you raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein together with the skin, a cleanly severed cut, and the length of the cut is the amount of two fingers joined together.
Or something similar, and you let out the amount of blood that you want, then you bind them with bandages and leave them until they heal.  And it has been explained earlier in the book the cutting and cauterization of them. As for the two arteries which are in the temples, the benefit of opening them is for chronic migraine, severe headache, persistent ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp humors directed towards the eyes.
And the manner of opening them is as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the veins appear clearly to the touch, and their pulsation becomes evident under your finger; then you mark with ink. Then you lift the skin from above the vein upwards with your index finger.
And you insert the lancet, the *nashshal*, from below and raise the vein upwards and sever it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out blood according to your need, then you loosen the constriction of the patient's neck and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then you place cotton and a bandage on it and bind it tightly from above and leave it until it heals.  Their mention, cutting, and cauterization have been explained earlier in the book. As for opening the vein of the forehead, its benefit, after opening the vein of the head, is for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, ulcers, and erysipelas.
And the manner of opening it, as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the vein appears, then you take the instrument called the axe, and this is its image:
You place the projecting spike which is at the head of the axe on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar, and you let the blood flow to the amount you desire, then you loosen the constriction of the patient's neck and bind it until it heals.
It may also be opened with a wide lancet, but the lancet should not have a sharp point like other lancets, rather it should have a slightly broad point, and you open it obliquely because the bone is near, so the lancet may break if it is thin.
As for the two veins which are at the temples, their benefit is for ailments of the eye such as ringworm, inflammation, and cataracts, and diseases of the face. As for the manner of opening them, it is that the patient constricts his neck with a turban, then you open them while you are standing over his head, and let the opening be slightly obliquely lengthwise with a small, slightly broad lancet.
For the location has no flesh; if the lancet is thin-pointed, it may break. Then you let out the amount of blood you need, and you place cotton on them and bind them for one night, then you unbind them. As for opening the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
And severe headache and diseases of the face like the red erysipelas which appears in the nose, especially if it is chronic.  As for the manner of opening it, the patient constricts his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long lancet.
And you pierce it in the middle of the nasal bone itself, between the nasal septum, straightly, because the vein does not appear to the touch there; then the blood will immediately appear.  And you should move your hand with the lancet a little and let out the amount of blood you need, then bind it for a night, for it clots quickly.
As for the jugular veins, the benefit of opening them is for shortness of breath, the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases which appear on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, scabies, bad sores, and cankers. As for the manner of opening them, the patient constricts below them in his neck with a bandage, and the surgeon stands at the head of the patient.
And the patient sits on a chair, then you open the vein lengthwise with a somewhat wide incision, then you let out a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see as necessary for that. Then you do likewise with the other vein, then you untie the bandage.
And you bind the veins moderately so that the patient does not suffocate, and you leave him until the next day, for the wound will heal. As for the veins of the temple, the benefit of opening them, after opening the veins of the head, is that it benefits from thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad sores, cracking of the lips, and bad sores.
which are in the nose and around it.  As for the manner of opening them, you seat the patient before you and bind his neck with a turban, then you turn back his lips and look at the two veins, one of which you see to the right of the lip and the other to the left of it, and you discern them by their blackness.
And that is also because around them are small, black veins; you cut them with a cutting incision. If it is difficult for you and you do not know what they are, aim to cut the largest and most obvious of them.  Likewise, do with the two veins which are in the lower lip.
As for the two veins which are under the tongue, the benefit of opening them, after opening the veins of the head, is for the inflammations which occur in the throat from a disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth.  As for the manner of opening them, you seat the patient before you facing the sun, and you raise his tongue and look under the tongue, on one side you will see a vein and on the other side a vein, and their color tends toward blackness.
Then you open them, and be careful not to go too far in cutting them, for beneath them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries may result. As for the three veins which are opened in the elbow, they are those which custom has established for opening in all people, and their opening is done in two ways.
Either by piercing with a wide, rounded or olive-shaped lancet to the depth, or by cutting with a knife-shaped lancet, which is the *nashal* [and this is its image], image of the wide, rounded lancet:
It is wide, as you see, so that it is suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins, which contain thick, turbid blood. And this is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:
And this lancet is less wide and thinner at the tip, suitable for opening thin veins which contain thin, yellowish blood. And this is the image of the *nashal* lancet:
This is the *nashal*, which is suitable for cutting, and there are types of it, wide and narrow, according to the width and narrowness of the veins also. And by this one may infer others, and it is well-known among craftsmen.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from the illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from what is near the chest and abdomen. And it is necessary for the phlebotomist, when opening it, to beware of it and be cautious, for beneath it is an artery. If he errs and goes too far in piercing with the lancet, he will cut that artery.
Then bleeding will occur. Therefore, it should not be opened with a lancet for piercing, but it should be opened by cutting with the *nashal*. If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it should be avoided and one should move to another, or seek one of its branches.
Or you may open in its place the vein of the arm, for it is clear, and cut it with the *nashal* lancet, as we said. If you wish to open it itself, then before tightening the arm, you should feel the place until you identify the place of the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then you tie the arm and cut the vein with a sharp cut with the *nashal* lancet, as we said, and be careful that the stroke falls far from the place of the artery. And when you see, upon tightening the ligature, a swelling in the place which you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood, upon opening the vein, spurt like the urine of a boy, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery.  Then immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops—and it often stops—then tighten the arm.
And leave it, and warn the patient against neglecting it, and let him be on his back and not move for several days until it heals.  If the bleeding does not stop and it overcomes you, and you do not have medicine at hand, then amputate the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell and split it, and take one half and bind it tightly on the vein with a ligature and pledgets until the next day. If the bleeding stops, well and good; otherwise, treat it with what was previously mentioned of placing styptics, and stopping its bleeding is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the smallness of the wound and the tightness of the ligature on the arm, know it. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from the top of the head and the lower body, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, as we said.
It is necessary for the one who opens it to be lying on his back when it is opened, for underneath it is a nerve. If he goes too deep with the lancet and injures the nerve, numbness occurs in it which is difficult to cure, and perhaps it will not heal at all.  And this nerve is often palpable.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and not visible, then you should make your incision with a lancet and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.  As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of opening it is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for diseases of the eyes, and it is preferable in this vein in particular, if you wish to open it, to use a lancet with an olive-shaped point or a wide, flat lancet, because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
However, when opening it, you should avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and look for the soft place. It does not harm if it is not opened on the first attempt to be opened again several times, except that it may swell in some people if it is not opened on the first attempt.
But that swelling does not harm it at all. As for the method of opening, its complications, and what should precede its treatment, the first thing is that you should know that opening is used either only for maintaining health.
Or it is used in diseases. That which is used to maintain health and longevity and to prevent the occurrence of diseases is that the opening should be in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the cephalic, the basilic, and the median, and that the opening should be at the beginning of spring when signs of plethora appear.
And the opening should be on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of daylight have passed. As for the opening that is used in diseases, it does not have a limited time, but whenever necessity and need require it, day or night.
And at every hour and at every time. Children should not be opened until they reach fourteen years of age, and the elderly who have passed sixty years should not be opened. If someone intends to open for any reason whatsoever.
He should cleanse his intestines before opening with a soft enema if there is much retained feces, lest putrid waste be drawn into the veins from the intestines upon opening, harming the principal organs.  And do not open the feverish, the drunk, or the intoxicated until that passes from them.
And let him also beware of opening after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive coitus, exertion, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, and everything that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental. Then look to the thinning of the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
With foods, drinks, and medicines if he is able to do so. Then let him enter the bath if nothing prevents him, or let him do some exercise so that the blood is thinned, and let the opening be in the middle of the day, as we have said. And let him intend to empty his chest that day of all bad mental states.
Such as worries, anger, and fear, and all physical conditions like excessive exertion and strain, coitus, and the like. And let him prepare for his session the things that people are accustomed to using, such as various perfumes and fragrant herbs, amusements, and the like, each person according to what he can.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion higher than the cushion on which the patient sits. Then let him extend his arm and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice or three times. Then let him tighten the bandage with the fillet and twist it twice or three times. Let the tightening be moderate.
For if the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening, it prevents the flow of blood, or if it is relaxed, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then after the tightening, it is necessary that the patient rub both his hands together.
Until the veins swell and become perceptible to the touch. Then let the phlebotomist wipe the lancet with a little old oil, especially. Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself, a little below the place which he wants to open, lest the vein evade and avoid the incision. For some veins you find are like a tendon; they evade when phlebotomized, and some are full of wind. When you place the lancet on them, they sink under the lancet, deceiving the phlebotomist; and he does not open the vein, or if he opens it, it is only a narrow opening.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be certain and deliberate in all these matters. Then let him insert the lancet. If the vein is opened at that time, well and good; otherwise, let him try again a little below or above that place quickly if the place is not swollen.
If the patient swells or is distressed, leave him for a day or two, and do not tighten the ligature, for it may bring on a hot swelling, and do not let him enter the bath. Then he may repeat the phlebotomy if he wishes.  If the lancet is inserted and the opening is small, and the flow of blood is thin,
and you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, then return the lancet to the same opening gently, keeping it straight, and increase the opening a little. Do this quickly before the place swells, for in many people the place may swell with a small opening.
But if you see that it has swollen, do not repeat it at all, for it will not help you. Put something of oil dregs on it, for it facilitates the flow of blood, and it is better in this case than oil itself and other ointments as well.
Therefore, use oil dregs in all your phlebotomies when the flow of blood is difficult.  The theriac and the schechnaia may also do this, if one of them is applied to the place, for the blood becomes thin and dissolves if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of phlebotomy—and this often happens, especially to one who has been bled only that once, or if the opening of the vein was small—then quickly apply a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water, and bind it for an hour, for it will resolve.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has completely left the vein itself or another vein. If something black or green remains in the place after a few days, it does no harm. If you wish, apply something of aloes and myrrh dissolved.
Or something of the juice of the  *fudanj* and the like. Often a swelling and a boil occur when bleeding from the basilica vein; place your hand upon it. If you find that it is soft when you press upon it, then it is a bad boil, so beware of putting anything on it of what we have mentioned.
For perhaps arterial blood will flow from it; but bandage it with something astringent to constrict the place, then treat it with the other treatments until it heals. And it is necessary to extract from each person a quantity of blood according to his strength and the color that predominates in the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it becomes red; and similarly, if you see it thick, let it flow until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is gone. And it is necessary for one who is full-bodied and strong and needs to have blood extracted at once,
to widen the opening of the vein and let the lancet be wide. And for one who is weak, the opposite. And it is necessary to extract it in stages, and let the opening be narrow.  And the best instrument to use in opening a vein is one that is sharp, well-sharpened, incised not punctured.
And this type of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve; and it is better and safer than bloodletting across or lengthwise. And if one is accustomed to fainting at bloodletting, then it is necessary to feed him before bloodletting something of bread soaked in pomegranate water or oxymel.
If he is feverish and blood is extracted from him in three or four times, then if he is of a cold temperament, let him take before bloodletting bread soaked in hydromel or in spiced honey-wine or in fragrant basil-wine.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting and its cause is the great outflow of blood, then it is necessary to give him meat-broth and thin basil-wine and use perfuming with galingale, and rub his chest with it, and use all that we mentioned in the section on fainting.
which results from vomiting. And as for one who wants to relieve his arm and to let his blood flow a second time, it is necessary for one whose bloodletting was for copious evacuation and whose strength is weak, that the blood be let little by little according to his strength on successive days.
And as for one who wants to relieve his arm and to let his blood flow a second time and whose body is strong, let him do that after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting. And as for one who wants to draw the blood from his body to the opposite side from that to which it inclined, it is necessary to relieve him on the second or third day.
And as for one in whose body the blood is abundant, has become hot and sharp, and has caused fever, it is necessary to extract the blood from him in one go and to extract a large quantity and to widen the opening until fainting occurs, after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting. And that you place your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood lest death occur instead of fainting, for that often occurs if the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs. And it is not necessary, if you want to loosen the arm and let the blood flow a second time,
if the mouth of the vein has closed and the exit of the blood is difficult, that you prick it forcefully or twist it strongly, for that is very bad; rather, either you leave it until you bleed him a second time, or you remove with the blade of the lancet what has congealed of the blood in the mouth of the vein.
Or you apply to it something of salt dissolved in water, or you apply to it something of theriac faruq or shukhzanaya and prick it delicately until the blood comes out; and if the vein has swollen, leave it.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides; and if necessity demands a second bloodletting and there is no alternative, either you bleed him above that place, or you bleed him in the other arm or in another vein.
And as for phlebotomy of the basilic vein, it is bled instead of the cephalic and basilic if they are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of them; and its method of phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly, then it is tied above it with a ligature slightly, a moderate tying.
Then you bleed the vein at a slight angle, neither across nor lengthwise, and let the opening be wide, and let your bleeding be a little above the joint of the hand; and if the exit of the blood is difficult, return the hand to the vessel with hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until it reaches your need; and if you are in the days of summer, you may dispense with returning the hand to the hot water, and the most that makes the blood flow in hot water is in the time of winter; and phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all the veins. Because there is no underlying vein or nerve beneath it; and as for phlebotomy of the median vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments; and its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after you put it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no underlying vein or nerve beneath it; and as for phlebotomy of the median vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments; and its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after you put it in hot water until the vein swells. And it becomes very apparent to the touch, then you bleed it at a slight angle, and even if you sever it completely, that will not harm him at all; and be careful not to thrust your hand deeply with the lancet, for beneath it is the nerve of the fingers and the place is bare of flesh; then return the hand to the hot water.
And leave it to flow; for if you do not return it to hot water, the blood will congeal in the mouth of the vein and be prevented from flowing; and when you have drawn out the amount of blood needed, place on the vein fat and salt lest it close quickly.
And likewise you should do with every narrow branch; and as for the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen; and likewise you do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second, the same; and as for phlebotomy of the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as uterine ailments.
And suppression of menstruation and kidney diseases and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs and similar diseases; and its method of phlebotomy is that he puts his leg in hot water and rubs it until the veins swell, then you tie above the joint of the leg with a ligature, and the vein is located at the heel, on the outside, toward the big toe.
And many branches extend from it on the surface of the foot; therefore bleed it in the widest branch of it, or at the heel where it joins—this is best and safest; and if you bleed it on the surface of the foot, then be careful of the nerves which are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
And make your incision as if you intend to amputate it, and let the lancet be sharp; and if the exit of the blood is difficult, then let him return his leg to hot water and leave the blood flowing until it is emptied; and if the phlebotomist misses the vein on the first attempt,
let him repeat the phlebotomy a little higher; for the place is safe, and there is no fear of harm from it if you are careful of the nerve as we said; and likewise you do with the saphenous vein of the other leg, the same; and as for the sciatic vein, its place is, as we said, at the heel from the outer side.
And its benefit is for pain in the hip if that is from excessive hot blood; and its method of phlebotomy is that you put the patient in the bath and hasten, and bind his leg from the hip to above the heel by four fingers' breadth with a thin, long bandage, for it will not appear except in this way.
Then, when it appears, bleed it in whatever way is most convenient for you, either by making an oblique incision, which is best, or by amputating it or making a longitudinal incision; for its position is safe, and it is in most people extremely hidden; and if you do not find it,
and it does not appear at all to the touch, then bleed some of its branches, which are those that appear on the back of the foot towards the little finger and ring finger, and be careful of the nerves, and let out the amount of blood that you desire.
Then loosen the bandage and place cotton on the place of the phlebotomy and bandage the place, for it will quickly heal.
Chapter ninety-six.
Concerning cupping and its method of use.
Cupping vessels may be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass, and cupping is of two kinds: one is cupping with scarification and removal of blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping without scarification is of two kinds.
And the cupping of the sides of the neck on both sides, and the cupping of the chin, which is under the lower jaw, and the cupping of the shoulders, and the cupping of the coccyx at the base of the spine, and the cupping of the forearms, which are the middles of the arms, and the cupping of the legs, and the cupping of the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the small veins spread throughout the flesh, and for this reason it does not weaken the body as much as bloodletting, and cupping, whether with fire or without, should not be used in any illness that is caused by fullness until the whole body is purged.
If there is a need for cupping because of illness or habit, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end, in the middle, and at any time whatsoever.
And that is because some people, when their blood increases to the point that they need to have it removed by cupping, feel heaviness and headache in their heads; and some feel fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck; and some feel itching in their face and sides, darkness and pain in their eyes; and some itch at the place of their cupping.
And some laugh a lot, and some find the taste of blood in their mouths, their gums swell, and they spit blood; and some sleep a lot; and some see in their sleep blood, redness, slaughter, and wounds, and things like that. So when we see any of that,
especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we order cupping at that time after two or three hours of the day have passed. As for the benefit of cupping the temples, it benefits from the heaviness in the head and water that flows into the eyes.
But it should be after the evacuation of the whole body. And this cupping may be a substitute for bloodletting of the head. And it is warned against using it for someone who is cold-headed or who has a cold, for it harms him greatly.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold diseases in their heads should not use it, and whoever persists in it will generate forgetfulness in him.
Therefore, the cupper should be ordered to lower his hand with the cupping glass a little lower, for fear of generating forgetfulness. As for cupping the nape of the neck, it is a substitute for bloodletting of the internal jugular vein and the basilic vein.
Therefore, it benefits from asthma, shortness of breath, rupture of the respiratory organ, cough, and fullness.  The cupping of the nape of the neck should be raised a little, for if it is lowered, it will produce weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it benefits from pains occurring in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, angina, and toothache. It is a substitute for bloodletting of the basilic vein. And the cupper should be ordered not to deepen his hand with the lancet, lest he cut an artery and cause bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it benefits from thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases in the mouth. It may take the place of bloodletting the veins in the lips. As for cupping the shoulders, it benefits from palpitations which result from fullness and heat.
As for cupping the insides of the forearms, it benefits from what benefits bloodletting of the three veins: the basilic, the internal jugular, and the cephalic; because it attracts blood from all those small veins in the flesh, and attracts those small veins from other thicker veins, until the attraction reaches the three thick veins.
The cupper should be ordered not to prolong the incision, because the place is devoid of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries. As for the single cupping applied to the coccyx, it benefits from hemorrhoids and sores of the lower part.
The cupper should be ordered that the cupping glass be large and of copper, because the place needs strong suction, and a glass cupping glass might break and make a large incision. As for cupping the legs, it visibly reduces fullness.
Because it attracts blood from the whole body, and benefits from chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; it promotes menstruation, and benefits from boils and abscesses; and it takes the place of bloodletting the saphenous veins and the veins of the heel, except that it weakens the body greatly, and fainting occurs in most people. The cupping of the veins of the heel has benefits similar to the cupping of the legs.
The method of applying cupping glasses is that the cupping glass is first placed empty and suctioned moderately. Do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors may flow to the place evenly. Continue to repeat this until you see the place has reddened and opened.
When the redness of blood appears, then make an incision and repeat the suction slowly. Then look at the condition of the bodies. If a person has loose flesh with porous pores, then it is necessary to incise only once, lest the place ulcerate.
And order the cupper to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, and to moderate the suction gently and with light movement. If the blood is thick, then it should be incised twice; in the first time, to open a way for the thin blood and its watery part, and in the second time, to completely extract the thick blood.
If the blood is very turbid, then repeat the incision a third time to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to extract a little blood, we are satisfied with one incision; if we want to extract a lot of blood, we make more incisions, especially if we judge that the blood is thick.
Then it is necessary to make a deep incision, and the moderate limit in the incision is only the depth of the skin. What should be used of ointments when placing cupping glasses, and of waters, and what the cupped person should avoid. As for someone whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and whose pores are tight,
then it is necessary to anoint the places of the cupping glasses with opening, softening, and resolving ointments. As for if it is in the summer time, then such as the oil of the quince, or the oil of violets, or the oil of sweet almonds, or the oil of pumpkin seeds.
And as for if it is in the winter, then such as the oil of daffodils, or the oil of iris, or the oil of chamomile, or the lily and similar. If the waste matter is thick and cold, then let the ointment be the oil of marjoram, or the oil of the  wild rue, or the oil of  milk, or the oil of rue, and similar.
If the cupped person has wide pores and soft flesh, then it is necessary to abstain from ointment. These should wash their cuppings after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with fox grape water, or with gourd water, or with chickweed water, and similar. And as for someone whose blood is very moist,
he should wash his cuppings with vinegar, or with water of myrtle and sumac, and similar. And as for someone whose waste matter is thick, he should wash his cuppings with old wine, or with marjoram water, or a decoction of rue, or chamomile, and similar.  And it is necessary to avoid cupping in the bathhouse and after the bathhouse.
Rather, it is necessary to use it after leaving the bathhouse by an hour or two hours. And no one should sleep after cupping. What it is necessary to manage for the cupped and the phlebotomized before cupping and after it.
It is necessary to look first. If the cupped or phlebotomized person is choleric and what predominates in his blood is sharpness and inflammation, then it is necessary that he take refrigerants like pomegranate and dandelion with vinegar, and lettuce, and oxymel, and sherbet, and similar, and he should make his foods of squabs and lamb meats, stews, and sour things, and similar.
And whoever his temperament is cold, then it is necessary that he be given honeyed drinks and dates syrup, or seed oxymel, and he should consume moderately perfumed wine, that which is between old and new, and he is ordered to little food, and he should make his food of squabs and thrushes and birds, and young pigeons, stews. And it is necessary that the drink on the day of cupping and phlebotomy be more than the food.
And it may be necessary to give some people at some times some of the theriac of al-Faruq, or musk medicine, or silphium, before cupping and before phlebotomy, or after it, to strengthen the principal organs and to thin the blood. And it is not necessary to give it to those who are feverish.
As for the cuppings which are without a condition, they are the cuppings which are placed on the liver and spleen and breasts and on the abdomen and navel and the place of the kidneys and the hip joint, for these organs do not tolerate a condition on them, but rather what is intended by them is either drawing blood from one organ to another.
Like our placing the cupping glass on the breasts in a case of epistaxis, or we use it to relieve an organ of a cold humor which has gathered in the organ, like our placing the cupping glass on the abdomen and navel, for it loosens the organ and warms it and removes the pain by resolving that humor.
And it may be placed on the kidneys if there appears in them an obstruction or a stone, for by the strength of its drawing it may perhaps open the obstruction or remove the stone from its place. And likewise it acts if it is placed on the liver and spleen in case of a humor which disturbs them. And these cuppings may be used empty, only by suction.
And it may be used with fire, and it may be used filled with lukewarm water in cases of sciatica, and that is to fill the cupping glass, and let it be large, with hot water alone, or with water in which some herbs suitable for that have been cooked.
Then it is placed full on the place and held and removed and repeated several times according to need. And this is the image of the cupping glass which is used with fire:
Its mouth should be the width of two open fingers, as we have pictured, and its depth about half a span, and there should be in its side, about its middle, a small hole about as large as a needle can enter; it is made of Chinese copper or yellow copper, thick-rimmed.
Smooth, level, polished, lest it injure the member when placed upon it; and there should be in its middle a crosswise groove of copper or iron where the lighted candle is placed.  And this cupping glass may be made larger than we have described, or smaller, according to the diseases.
And the instrument used for this: for the cupping glasses of children and thin people are not the same as those of men and stout-bodied people.  As for the method of placing this cupping glass with fire on the member, it is to bring a lighted wick of tightly-twisted linen, or a small candle of pitch, and to place it on the middle of the strengthened bar which is in the middle of the cupping glass.
So that the ascent of the fire will be upwards towards the bottom of the cupping glass, lest the body of the patient be burnt; then it is placed on the member, and the finger on the hole which we mentioned, until, when we have held the cupping glass as long as we need, the finger is removed.
And the vapor will come out through that hole, and the cupping glass will adhere to the place. Then bring the wick in the same way, and replace it if you need to. As for the cupping glass which is used in the treatment of sciatica with water, it has neither a strengthened bar nor a hole.
It is only used by being filled with water and placed on the member.  And this is its form:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to hold much water, the better it is.
Chapter ninety-seven.
On the suspension of the leech.
Leeches are used mostly in cases where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either because of the small size of the member, like the lip and gum and so on, or because the member is devoid of flesh, like the finger and nose and so on.
And the method of using them is that you choose leeches which are in fresh, pure water, free from impurities, then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry and nothing remains in their bellies. Then the body is first purged by bloodletting or cupping, then the affected member is wiped.
Until it reddens, then they are applied; and when they are full, they fall off. And if it is possible to cup the place, it is more effective; otherwise, wash the place with vinegar, then with much water, and rub and press. If the bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and this is a trickle, then wet a linen cloth in cold water.
And place it on top until the trickle stops. If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle on it powdered vitriol or alum or similar astringents until the bleeding stops, or apply halves of peeled walnuts to the place.
And leave it until the walnut adheres to the place, for then the blood will stop. And it is preferable, if it is necessary to reapply leeches, not to apply those same leeches if others are available. If the leeches refuse to adhere, let the place be wiped with fresh blood.
Or pierce a needle into the place until some blood comes out, then apply them; for when they sense some blood, they adhere to the spot. And if you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them some aloes, or salt, or ashes; then they will fall off immediately.
Chapter Three.
On setting (bones).
This chapter also deals with what is needed in the art of medicine, namely the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never examined the books of the ancients on it, nor read a single letter from them.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become extinct in our country, and I have never encountered anyone at all who is skilled in it. And I have only acquired what I have acquired from my long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them, until I extracted knowledge of it from them, then I adhered to experience and practice for my whole life.
And I have depicted for you in this chapter everything that my knowledge encompasses. And my experience has passed over it after I have brought it closer to you and freed it from the ramifications of prolixity, and I have shortened it to the utmost, and clarified it to the utmost, and I have depicted for you in it many images of the instruments that are used in it.
For it is from an increase in explanation, as I did in the preceding two chapters, and there is no strength except in God, the Most High, the Greatest.
The first chapter.
In it are summaries and compendia concerning the matter of fractures of bones, and it is necessary to present them before we begin to mention the broken and dislocated members one by one.  Therefore, it is necessary that we mention at the beginning of this chapter summaries of discourse and sections. It compels you first to understand them and stand upon their reality, you and others who are eager to learn this noble craft.
So I say that whenever a fracture, dislocation, wound, or fall occurs to someone, it is necessary to hasten first to bleed him or purge him, or both. Unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength, or the one to whom this occurred is a child or a very old man, or the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then restrict his diet to cold vegetables and the meat of birds and gazelles, and forbid him drink, strong meats, and overfilling with food, and every food that fills the veins with blood, until the swelling is safe and the flow of material to the place is not expected.
Then let the patient return to his first regimen, which is his custom.  When the broken bone begins to knit, then the patient should eat foods that are very nourishing, strong, and thick, containing viscosity, such as porridges, rice, heads, and brains, and cow's paunches. And eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and the like, for by this regimen the consolidation of the fracture will be quicker and better. And know that broken bones, if they are in strong men and old men, cannot ever unite and join together in their first nature.
Because of the dryness of their bones and their hardness. And it may unite and join what was of bones extremely soft, like the bones of very small children. But nature produces on the broken bone from all its sides something resembling glue, thick, which adheres to it and tightens it until some of it adheres to some of it.
And binds some of it to some of it until it comes to the utmost strength and solidity as it was at first, until nothing hinders it from its actions.
For this reason, it is necessary to give the patient foods which contain solidity, viscosity, and thickness, as we said. And know that the fracture may differ in its types according to the difference of the members, for the fracture of the bone of the leg is different from the fracture of the bone of the head, and the fracture of the bone of the chest is different from the fracture of the bone of the back.
And so are all the other members, each differing from the other. And we shall come to the mention of each type of fracture explained in its chapter in detail apart from the others.  And the type of fracture of the bone may also differ in itself.
For it may be its fracture a shattering without fragments occurring in it, and its fracture may be along the length of the bone, and its fracture may have fragments and protrusions, separated and unseparated, and the fracture may be with a wound and perforation in the skin, and the fracture may be a slight crack.
And for each type there is a special method in its setting, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. And of what makes known a fracture of the bone is its crookedness and swelling and its appearance to the sense, and its roughness when you probe it with your hand.
Then when there is not in the place an apparent crookedness, nor roughness, nor do you feel upon touching the bone a disturbance, nor does the patient feel much pain, then there is not a fracture, but it may be a sprain or a slight fracture or a slight crack, so it does not behoove you to move it by extension and probing at all.
Rather apply to it of the medicaments the mention of which will come after a while, that which suits the place, then bind it gently. And know that if the bone is shattered and broken in two without fragments occurring in it, except that each part has moved away from its fellow.
Then it behooves you to hasten at once to its straightening and setting before a hot swelling occurs to it.  If a hot swelling occurs to it, then leave it for days until the hot swelling subsides, then set it in whatever way you are able of gentleness and skill.
And know that its setting and straightening is easier than a bone in which fragments have occurred. Then it is bound as will be mentioned. If there are fragments in the bone, then it is necessary to extend the broken limb from both sides, whether hand or foot.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with rope and hand. And let your placing of the limb be on a level place according to its natural shape, until when the broken parts of the bone are extended, then return those fragments to their places in whatever way you are able of skill and gentleness.
And strive with all your effort that you do not cause the patient pain or suffering by your action, and strive with all your effort to join one of the bones to its fellow in the best manner. And it is necessary at that time that you touch and feel them with your hand; if you see there something contrary, correct and straighten it to the extent of your ability.
And beware of excessive extension and strong probing, as many ignorant people do, and they often cause by their action a hot swelling or stiffness in the limb, as I have witnessed repeatedly from their actions.
Then, after the setting, perfection, and binding, keep that limb still and quiet, and warn the patient not to move it while awake or asleep, and when he turns and fidgets, and when he has a bowel movement, and in all his movements to the best of his ability, and let him seek to have the position of the limb be a position that ensures safety from pain.
And that is because whenever he feels pain or suffering in the position of the limb, he should move it to another position in which he does not feel pain, and he should strive that that position is level and straight.
Lest crookedness occur in the limb if it is set, and as for the manner of binding the broken limb, it is as I describe to you. Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness and largeness and shapes.  And those of them that are small, like the arm, finger, forearm, and the like.
Then it is necessary that the bandages be soft and gentle; and those that are large, like the thigh, back, and chest, then it is necessary that the bandages be broad and firm, because a wide bandage is necessary for a large limb and binds it from every side with an equal binding so that no flaw interferes.
Then, after you have finished the setting, you begin to apply the appropriate plaster. With a soft, gentle pull on the site of the fracture, then you begin to wrap the bandage on the site of the fracture itself, three or four turns, according to what the limb requires, and you pull the bandage slightly with your hand, then you take it to the upper side of the fracture site.
With less tightening than you did to the fractured area, then you gradually spread the wrapping away from the fracture site and loosen the tightening little by little until you take something suitable from the correct position, then you take another bandage and wrap it also on the fractured area.
turns, then you take the wrapping to the lower side of the fracture, and let your action in tightening and loosening the wrapping be as we mentioned in the first upper wrapping, then you place between the bandages from the soft padding or cloths what evens out the crookedness of the fracture.
If there is crookedness, otherwise do not put anything in it, then wrap another bandage around it, then set the firm splints on these bandages immediately, if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, then apply what alleviates that swelling and removes the inflation and leave it for some days, then tighten the splints on it then, and let the splints be from broad, carved, skillfully prepared halves of reeds, or let the splints be from sieve wood.
which are made from pine or palm leaves or willow or boxwood and the like of what is available from that, and let the width of each splint be in this image and this shape precisely.
Except that the splint which is placed on the fracture itself should be a little thicker and broader than the other splints, and as for the length of the splint, it is made according to what suits the broken limb, in its size and smallness. Image of the splint:
Then tighten the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening precisely, then tie from above with firm threads according to what we mentioned of the tightening, which is that your tightening on the place of the fracture should be more. And the farther it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And the threads should be moderate in thickness and thinness, and let them be of wet linen especially, because if the threads are thick, as I have seen done by the ignorant, who make their threads from twisted linen strips, this is a great mistake.
Because the tightening with them falls outside of moderation, and thin threads are also unsuitable because you do not achieve with the tightening what you want, and there should not be less than a finger between the splint and the splint.
If the patient is harmed by the ends of the splints after tightening in the sound places, then place under them soft tow or fluffy wool so that nothing harms him from that. As for if the fracture is with a wound and a rupture occurs in the skin, we will mention that separately.
Know that not every broken limb should be tightened with splints from the first day. That is, if the limb is large, the splints should not be placed on it except after five or seven days or more, according to your assurance that hot swelling will not occur.
And this is a description of the bandages with which the ancients used to bind fractures, dislocations, and sprains. A description of a common, brief bandage that binds fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is something that is not overcome by heat or cold.
And it is that you take from the dust of the mill, which is the essence of the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill during the movement of the mill, then you knead it as it is, without sifting it, with egg white, and make its kneading neither thick nor thin, then you apply it.
The description of another bandage that binds fractures, dislocations, and sprains. Take of mastic, leadwort, acacia, resin, gum tragacanth, and sugar, ten drachmas of each; and of myrrh and aloes, five drachmas of each; and of lote tree, twenty drachmas; and of Armenian or Roman clay, twenty drachmas. Pound everything together and mix it with lote tree water or with egg white if the patient's temperament is hot, then use this bandage, for it is good in composition, quickly binds broken bones, and is suitable for most people because of its moderation.
The description of another bandage which is also beneficial for fractures and sprains. Take gum tragacanth, mastic, and white lead, ten drachmas of each; myrrh and aloes, five drachmas of each; acacia, six drachmas; Armenian clay, twenty drachmas. Pound everything finely, sift it, and knead it with water or egg white and use it.
The description of a bandage for joints and bones that have shifted from their positions, and it soothes the pain occurring in them, and for bone cracks and fractures. Take carded wool and dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and place it on the affected area. This bandage does not have the power to set.
But it is excellent in alleviating hot swelling and relieving pain especially. The description of another bandage that sets broken bones. Take the leaves of the deaf fig and the leaves of wild poppy, and pound them together and bandage with them while moist. The description of another brief bandage used when a bone fracture is setting.
And you want to resolve the remainder of the swelling, take of the root of white lead, chamomile, violet flowers, and starch, one part of each; pound everything together and knead it with egg white if the member is not inflamed; but if it is inflamed, then knead it with coriander water or with water and use it.
The description of another bandage stronger in resolution than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs when the bone is setting. Take of the root of white lead, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, balm mint, violet flowers, and chamomile, one part of each.
Pound everything together and knead it with vinegar or with fresh water or with egg white, all according to the heat of the member and the stillness of its inflammation. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that it should be placed on the broken member when it is set.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil only, and he described it as being moderate between thickness and thinness. As for Galen, he saw that things that contain drying agents with something of heat, such as myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, and the like that we have mentioned, should be placed on the broken member when it is set.
The description of a bandage that is useful for weakness and pain. Take comfrey, fumitory, human hair, plucked, or bird feathers, and leadwort, and salt, equal parts. Pound, sift, and knead, and bandage with it. As for the amount that the bandage should remain...
Then loosen it.  You should observe: if no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place occurs in the afflicted area, do not loosen it for many days. If, however, severe itching or troubling pain or swelling occurs in the area...
then hasten to loosen it immediately and do not delay at all, and remove the bandage from it. Then take a soft cloth or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching and pain subside. Then leave the member to rest for an hour.
Then apply carded wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and bind it on for a night until you are safe from hot swelling, the swelling of the member subsides, and its pain goes away. Then return it to gentle tightening and a light bandage, and do not tighten it as tightly as the first time.
And treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and puffiness, and all the symptoms have gone completely, and you need a bandage and tightening, then prepare it as you did initially, equally. If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs in the member...
then do not loosen it except after three, four, five, or seven days, and it may be left for twenty days; all this depends on what appears to you of the condition of the member, as we said, until the fracture sets and the flesh begins to join together on it.
Then also increase the tightening more than your first tightening, and also increase the nourishment of the patient beyond what was previously mentioned. If you see that the place of the fracture has dried up and become thinner than it should be, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Then bathe it with lukewarm water each time you loosen it, and let this be every three days, and lessen the tightening a little. For by this action nourishment will flow to the member, and it will heal quickly. As for what ignorant bone-setters do, of breaking the member again…
if it is not set properly at first, and is set crookedly, then it is a mistake in their action and a great deception. And if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and acted upon it, and I have seen no trace of it from any of them at all. and the correct thing is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
On accidental fractures in the head.
The types of accidental fractures in the head are many, their forms varied, and their causes diverse.  Some fractures are caused by a sword blow, and it may either completely sever the bone until it reaches the membrane beneath the bone. Just as the adze does in wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called adze-like. Or, the sword may cut some of the bone and sever only its surface, without the cut penetrating to the end; this type of fracture is called a complete avulsion, and the wound of these two fractures may be either large or small.
And there are fractures which are comminuted or contused; their cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone or something similar. This fracture may be penetrating, nearly reaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be on the surface of the bone.
And the wound of these two fractures is also either large or small.  And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone, as thin as a hair; it is a slight crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called hairline.  And there is a fracture caused by a fall or a blow with a stone or the like, which drives a part of the bone inwards, causing a depression in the area, just as happens to a copper pot when struck, causing a part of it to be driven inwards.
This most often occurs in the moist bones of the head, like the heads of children.  All these types of fractures may have loose or non-loose fragments. We shall describe the treatment of all of them in their proper place, and we shall recognize all these types of fracture by examining them.
And examining them with probes and removing the corrupt flesh from them. As for the hairline type, it is known by examining the bone, and rubbing and staining it with ink; then the fracture appears black. As for the treatment of the fracture, first look at the patient's symptoms.
If you see among his symptoms that which clearly indicates danger, such as vomiting bile, swelling, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, sunken and reddened eyes, and similar symptoms, then do not approach the patient or treat him, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not frighten you and you hope for his recovery, then begin his treatment.  And if the wounded man comes to you immediately after his injury, and this is in the winter months,
you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case. And if it is in the summer months, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone is corrupted and those symptoms we described appear.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain and there is shattering and bruising, then you should cut away the shattered and bruised part as I describe to you: that is, shave the head of the wounded patient.
And uncover the bone in whatever way is possible for you and according to the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient. If, when examining the bone, you find bleeding or hot swelling, then treat that as is appropriate.
That is, pack the area with cloths soaked in a syrup and rose oil, and clean the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then begin to rasp away the bone and remove it; this can be done in one of two ways.
The first way is to cut the bone with a delicate saw with a narrow blade.  This is its image:
Then use another saw, slightly wider than the first. This is its image:
Then also use another saw, wider still than the second.  It is necessary that you have several different saws, some wider than others, and some shorter than others, and that they be extremely sharp at their edges, and let them be of Indian steel or good steel.
And use gentleness in striking the saw, lest you shake the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and hard, then it is necessary to perforate around it before using the saws with the drills which they call non-immersive drills; and they are called non-immersive drills.
Because they do not go beyond the limit of the skull bone to what is beyond it, for the drill has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a ring or small circle, preventing it from sinking and going beyond the thickness of the bone.
And it is necessary for you to take many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have for every skull a drill whose sharp end is, in length and shortness, suitable for the thickness of that skull.  And this is an image of three types. Of the drills: large, medium, and small.
As for the method of perforation around the fractured bone, it is that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then you move the drill to another place, and you make the distance between each hole the thickness of an awl or similar.
Then you cut between each two holes with the cutters, and you do this with the utmost gentleness you can, as we said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument prepared for that.
Such as the rasps and delicate forceps. And it is necessary that you be very careful that the drill or cutter does not touch anything of the peritoneum.  If the bone is removed and is free from the peritoneum, if it was attached to it, and you have extracted it, then it is necessary to cleanse it.
And smooth the roughness remaining in the bone with another instrument similar to the cutter, except that it should be finer and more delicate than the other cutters. If any small bones or splinters remain, take them gently with the instruments you have.
Then you treat the wound afterwards with lint and ointments which will be mentioned. As for the other method of operation, it is a very easy method, far from danger, mentioned and highly praised by Galen. And this is what he says. First you should begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and obvious, until, when you have exposed that part, you place the tip of this lenticular cutter underneath it, and this is its image:
The lenticular part of it should be smooth so that it does not cut anything, and the sharp part of it is on its sides extending lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests against the peritoneum and the face of the sharp cutter against the bone; then strike the cutter from one side.
With a small hammer until you cut all the bone gently as it rotates, and you are safe from the membrane, so that nothing frightening happens to it at all, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were sleepy.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some parts of the bone, scrape it off with the tip of the lenticular cutter itself and carefully free it from it, for it will be freed from it without harm or fear.
But if the fracture of the bone did not penetrate to the membrane, and what was broken from the bone was its surface, and roughness and small fragments remained in it, then you should remove that roughness and extract those fragments with fine forceps, a number of which have been made of different sizes so that you may use in each place that which is most suitable and appropriate according to what the work leads you to.
And the broken bone itself and its shape, and you should use first in your scraping of the bone the widest of those forceps, then use after it a finer one, and continue to do that successively until you come to use the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the other small hairline cracks and slight fractures, you should use for each one a treatment according to what leads to its healing, which is something that is not hidden from anyone who has the least experience in this art and has studied what we have written and explained concerning large fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you remove the bone, you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth. And dip it in syrup and rose oil and place it on the first cloth and do this as gently as you can so as not to burden the peritoneum, then use a wide bandage on top and do not tighten it except to the extent that it only holds the wound.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are certain the hot swelling has subsided, then unwrap it and use afterwards medicines which have a drying quality, such as the roots of iris, and powdered cyclamen, and powdered spikenard, and ziraund and the like; and that is that you make from these medicines a powder.
And sprinkle it on the wound as it is dry; and in general, use in that a medicine which cleanses and does not sting, and strive with all your effort during your treatment of the wound that it be clean, without grease or dirt, and do not let pus collect in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the membrane of the brain it corrupts and spoils it, and from that happens to the patient a great calamity; and it may happen in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if one is negligent in its treatment.
Blackness on its surface; if the symptoms we mentioned appear to the patient, then know that he is inevitably doomed.  And if the blackness only occurred from a medicine which was applied, and it was in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness.
It is necessary that you take one part honey and three parts rose oil, and mix them well, and smear them on a cloth, then place it on the peritoneum, then treat it with the various treatments which are necessary until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the setting of a broken nose.
Know that there is no fracture of the nose except of both its upper parts, or one of them, because they are bones, for the lower part of it is cartilaginous and does not fracture, but rather it is subject to contusion, crookedness, and flattening.
If one of its parts is fractured, then it is necessary that you insert the little finger into the nostril and set that fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside until you return the nose to its natural shape.  Let this be done gently by you, and be careful that your action does not cause pain to the patient.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, then it should be set with the end of a probe of slight thickness. If the fracture is on both sides, then do likewise, and let him hasten to set it on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after seven or ten days, when the hot swelling has subsided, then insert into the nostril a pledget of linen cloth if the fracture is on one side, or insert two pledgets if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the pledgets be of a thickness to fill the nostril.  Some of the early bone-setters mentioned that the pledgets should be moistened with fat and changed every day, but I do not think this is the case; rather, the pledgets should be moistened with egg white mixed with powdered millstone.
Then leave the pledgets until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens.  Goose quills, after having been wrapped with soft cloths, may be inserted into the nose at the location of the pledgets; this will make the retention of the nasal fracture firmer and will prevent the patient from being unable to breathe.
This is not necessary; if you wish, you may do it, and if you wish, you may make the pledgets. If a hot swelling should appear in the nose during your work, apply a compress to the nose with  kyroton or with cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil or something of diachylon ointment.
If no hot swelling appears, it is necessary to dress it externally with fine semolina and powdered myrrh mixed with egg white, then place a soft bandage over it, and do not bind the nose at all, if the nasal bones are fractured in small pieces.
Or if it is fragmented, it is necessary to incise it and extract the fragments with the appropriate instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with suitable ointments that heal and cicatrize.  If a wound occurs inside the nose, it is necessary to treat it with pledgets and use lead tubes. until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the setting of the lower jaw if it is fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, if the fracture is only external and it is not fractured into two pieces and is not depressed inwards, then its identification is easy.
It is necessary, if the fracture is in the right side, that you insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth, and similarly if the fracture is in the left side, you insert the index finger of the right hand and gently lift the edge of the fracture from the inside to the outside.
And with your other hand from outside the bone, you control it to straighten it. If the fracture of the jaw has been broken into two, then it is necessary to use traction from both sides in a straight line until you are able to straighten it. If it has occurred in the teeth, a protrusion.
Or if they are separated, then tie what you hope will remain with a gold, silver or silk thread, then place on the fractured jaw a splint, then place over it a folded cloth, and place over the cloth a firm large splint or a piece of leather the length of the jaw. Then tie it from above according to what is convenient for you to tie and matches its closure so that it does not become undone, and you order the patient to rest and be still, and you make his food soft soups. If you think that something has changed in its appearance in any way, then hasten to untie it on the third day.
Then tie it from above according to what is convenient for you to tie and matches its closure so that it does not become undone, and you order the patient to rest and be still, and you make his food soft soups. If you think that something has changed in its appearance in any way, then hasten to untie it on the third day. Then you repair what you have bandaged with mill dust mixed with egg white or with semolina flour after removing the splint from it, and you place a soft pad over the bandage. As long as that bandage adheres to it and the condition of the bone does not change, leave it.
Do not untie it until it heals and the fracture is strong, for often this fracture becomes strong in three weeks. If a hot swelling appears during that time, use what we have repeatedly mentioned to soothe it until that swelling goes away.
And as for if the fracture is with a wound, you look; if a splinter or splinters have separated from the bone, be gentle in removing those splinters with whatever instrument is suitable for you to remove them.  If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as much as you need.
Then, when you have removed those splinters and nothing remains of them, stitch the mouth of the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for that. And stitch the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the setting of the clavicle if it is fractured.
The clavicle is most often fractured in front, at the end of the shoulder, and its fracture is of three types: either it is broken into two without splinters, which is the easiest to set;
or splinters occur in the fracture, which is more difficult to set; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.  The procedure, if the fracture is without a wound, is that you prepare two assistants, one to hold the arm adjacent to the fractured clavicle, and the other to extend the neck towards the other side.
Then you set the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and there is no prominence or irregularity. If you need more extension, you should place a ball of rags or wool under the patient's armpit.
The size of the ball should suit your needs. You extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is set as it should be. If you are unable to pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it has gone inwards, then the patient should lie on his back.
A moderately sized pillow is placed under his shoulder, and the assistant presses his shoulder downwards until the clavicle that is deep rises upwards. Then set the fracture and align it with your fingers.
If you feel that a splinter of the clavicle has broken off and is moving, you should incise over it and remove that splinter gently. If the splinter is embedded in the bone, try to cut it with one of the instruments prepared for this purpose. After placing under the clavicle the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which is an instrument of wood or iron, and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a bowl. Its width should be according to the size of the bone, large or small, and its length should also be according to what you can manage for the work. Let it be double-ended, as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.
If the wound opening that you made when removing the bone splinter is wide and you are not concerned about hot inflammation, then join the edges of the wound with sutures. If the opening is small, or you fear hot inflammation, then treat the wound with lint and pledgets according to the size of the incision.
If hot inflammation develops, moisten the lint in rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it. As for setting a bone that is not fractured or incised, this is done by applying to the bone a bandage made from mill dust with egg white. And you place a soft pad over it, then you place a ball under his armpit if he needs it. Then you take a bandage that is very long, its width being a cubit or so, then apply a folded pledget over the pad and bandage, then take a splint of thin wood. Let its width be three fingers and its length likewise. Then wrap it in a cloth, then wrap that cloth with the splint in the part of the bandage that lies on the fracture site, then tighten the bandage on the fracture as you wrap it. And pass it over his neck and under his sound armpit and under his injured armpit, and pass it repeatedly on each side, and however you see that the tightening secures the fracture firmly, which is not hidden from you.
And the aim of all this is that the splint does not move from the fractured bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day; whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, correct it and tighten the bandage. Then let the patient sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
So that his arm is raised from his side, and the clavicle fracture is raised with the elevation of the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck. And do not untie the bandage unless an incident occurs in the area, such as itching or swelling, until twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. Then return to the binding and leave it until the clavicle fracture heals and consolidates, and it strengthens and becomes firmer; this takes about twenty-eight days. And in some people, it may be less than that.
Chapter Six.
Concerning the setting of a fractured humerus. The humerus rarely fractures in its wide part; rather, it fractures at its extremities.  When a part of it is fractured, or it is fractured in its middle, this is known by touch.  So, according to the shape of the fracture, treat accordingly.
Set it and return it to its natural shape by any means you can. Then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft tow. Place over this a compress of folded cloth, and then apply a broad splint of wood.
Thin enough to cover the whole shoulder or slightly wider. If, under the splint, there is a prominence in any part of the shoulder, smooth that prominence with soft tow so that the splint lies evenly, then bind it tightly from above with a long bandage.
Bind it firmly and make sure the splint does not move from its place. Check the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it moves from its place. Let the patient lie on his sound side. The shoulder heals in twenty [days].
days or twenty-five days. When this time is complete, remove the bandage, and you are safe, for it is among the bones which one does not fear will be crushed or broken.  If a splinter of bone protrudes and is irritating under the skin, incise over it and remove it. And do what was mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle, to calm the hot swelling if anything of that happens.
Chapter Seven.
On the setting of a fracture of the chest.
The chest may be fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens; but its extremities are more commonly fractured and shattered.  Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, is that it inclines downwards, and there is intense pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing.
And perhaps blood is discharged, and the depression in the fractured bone is apparent and not hidden from touch.  Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, and a pillow is placed between his shoulders; then his shoulders are compressed, and the ribs are brought together by hands from the sides, and gentleness is used in smoothing it in every way possible.
And continue until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be; then apply a bandage and a splint, and place over it a splint of thin wood from willow or elm, or something similar that is light, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then gently bind it to the fractured bone lest it shift; and pass the bandage around to the back several times and tighten it firmly; then examine the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if necessity dictates its removal because of suppuration that appears in the area, or pain, or swelling, then hasten to remove it, take off the bandage, and treat whatever has appeared, according to its treatment; then reapply the bandage if you see fit. And his face, and bind him firmly until he heals.
Chapter Eight.
Concerning the treatment of fractured ribs. Know that fractures of the ribs occur in the thick parts that are next to the back, and their ends in front;  they are subject to injury because they are cartilaginous, and this is easily recognized by palpation with the fingers.
And its treatment is that you set the fracture with your fingers in the accessible way until the shape is properly aligned, then you bandage and bind the fractured bone with a splint if it needs it. If the rib fracture is angled inwards, then the patient experiences severe pain.
And it [the fractured rib] pushes inward, like the inward displacement that occurs in those with a punctured lung, because the bone pushes against the diaphragm; and it also causes shortness of breath, coughing and the expulsion of much blood. This is difficult to treat, and the ancients devised many stratagems for it.
And some of them said that it is necessary to give the patient foods that produce flatulence and wind so that the abdomen becomes distended and expands, and the fracture is pushed outwards.  We dislike this, lest it confirm the occurrence of hot inflammation if it has not yet occurred; and if it has occurred, then it increases and confirms it.
And some said that a cupping glass should be placed on the area, then strongly sucked; and this is more similar to reason, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will draw humors to the area because of its weakness. And some said that the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil.
And make a pad between the ribs until it is full, so that the bandage is even when you wrap it around; then treat the patient with the treatment for a punctured lung, in terms of diet and medicine. If the patient is overwhelmed by a severe condition that he cannot bear, and the bone pushed against the diaphragm in a harmful way, and we feared for the patient; therefore, it is necessary to make an incision in the area and expose the fractured rib, then place under it the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which has been previously described, and gently break the bone and remove it.
Then we bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot inflammation appears in the meantime, then act quickly: wet pads in rose oil and place them on the area, and treat the patient internally with things that calm the inflammation as well.
And he should lie on the side on which sleep comes easiest to him until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
On the setting of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture affects them—and this rarely happens; more often they suffer contusion—and similarly the vertebrae of the back as well, if this happens to someone and you want to know whether he will recover or not, look: if you see that his hands have become relaxed, numb, and dead, and he is unable to move them, extend them, or flex them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle he does not feel it and finds no pain in them, then know that in most instances he will not recover; he is dying.
But if he moves them and feels the pinch and prick, then know that the marrow of the bone is safe and the patient will recover with treatment. If the vertebrae of the back are similarly affected and you want to know whether he will recover or not,
look at his legs: if you see that they have become relaxed and what happened in the hands has happened in them, then if he lies on his back, wind and excrement come out involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily, and if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is dying; do not bother with his treatment. If none of this happens to him, the matter is less serious. The treatment of what has happened is to try to alleviate the hot swelling.
by placing on the affected vertebra rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks; apply this three times a day until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply one of the strengthening, drying compresses to the area and bind it tightly, and instruct him to remain still and quiet.
And let him sleep only on the side where he feels no pain until he recovers. If a splinter or something else has become detached from the bone at the time of the injury, then it is necessary to incise the skin and remove that bone. Then, if the wound is large, bring the edges together with sutures, then treat with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the tailbone, is broken, then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the rectum.
and set the broken bone with the other hand as far as possible and as the setting allows, then apply the compress and splint if necessary, and then bind it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, then incise it and remove it, and treat the wound with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
Hip bones rarely fracture; but if they do fracture, it is usually in such a way that their extremities are shattered, they split lengthwise, and they are displaced inwards.  The patient experiences pain in the affected area, weakness, and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.
Its treatment is that you pass your hand over it until you ascertain the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only in the extremities, then set that fracture as best you can, until it resembles its natural form.
If the fracture is lengthwise or if it has been displaced inwards, lay the patient on his stomach until you are ready to set the fracture.  When you have set it, apply a bandage, then place a splint of wood or leather over it, and bind it tightly.
Do not fear that the fracture will shift or the splint will come loose.  Fill in any hollows with padding so that the binding is even. Instruct the patient to lie on his back or on his sound side. If he develops a hot inflammation, ...
...cease manipulation and treatment until the hot inflammation subsides. Apply whatever remedies will alleviate it, as described above. Then return to setting and binding it as is proper. If there are fragments or shattered pieces of bone, they should not be removed.
They should not be touched but rather smoothed from the outside, as we have said, and the binding should be left in place until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the treatment of a fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is fractured, treat it in one of two ways. One is to take a smooth, curved piece of wood of moderate thickness, in this manner:
And you tie two bandages to its ends, then it is hung from a high place, and the patient sits on a chair, then his broken arm is placed on the wood until his armpit is touching the middle of the curve of the wood, then something heavy is hung from above it.
Or a servant stretches it downwards, then the physician sets the fracture with his two hands until he returns the fracture to what is appropriate. The other method is that the patient lies on his back and his hand is hung from his neck with a bandage.
Then you order two servants, one to hold above the fracture with his hands and the other to hold below it, and each stretches to his side. And if you wish the stretching to be stronger, then tie below the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage, and each of the servants stretches to his side.
If the fracture is near the end of the shoulder, then the middle of the bandage should be under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.  Likewise, if the fracture is near the elbow, then the bandage should be in that place and on the elbow itself.
Then set the fracture gently without violence, until the fracture is set as it should be and unites well. Then bandage it if no hot swelling appears. If a hot swelling appears, then leave bandaging until the seventh day and apply a moistened, soft cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then bandage it. The method of bandaging is to apply the compress to the fracture, then apply a bandage of new cloth over the compress, then bring the forearm against the upper arm itself and place his open hand on his shoulder.
And apply the cloth and bandage to the upper arm and forearm so that the forearm acts as a splint, if nothing prevents you from doing so and nothing changes in the broken bone. If you fear that something will change, then use splints.
And it is that you place on the fracture itself a splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints, and let there be the width of a finger between each splint, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
Then tighten the splints with the tightening I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And that your tightening on the place of the fracture be stronger.
And the further from the fracture, the less the tightening. If you see that the placing of the splints and the tightening are as we said when you set the limb at once, then do so.
And if you fear a hot swelling, leave off the tightening and the splints until the seventh day, as we said. Then examine the bandage every three days, lest there occur at the place chafing or swelling, or the nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb because of excessive tightening.  Correct all this as we mentioned.
But if you are confident that nothing of that sort will happen, do not loosen the bandage except after many days. And let the patient lie on his back, with his hand on his stomach, and a cushion filled with wool, of moderate size, be placed under the arm.
And examine at every time, of night or day, lest the shape of the broken limb be disarranged, or the bandage become slack.  Correct all this with your effort, and let the patient's diet be according to what we have already stated; that is, that the food should be light at first, until the bone begins to consolidate.
Then it is necessary to make his food more substantial. For it is the nature of the arm and leg to consolidate in forty days. Then it is necessary to loosen [the bandage], and he should use the bath and be treated with the ointments suitable for this. If the fracture is severe and comminuted,
do not loosen the bandage from him until fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called the ulna; one is small, and it is that which is next to the thumb, and the other is large, and it is situated beneath the small one from below.  Therefore, perhaps the larger ulna is fractured alone, or the smaller one alone, and perhaps both are fractured together.
When the smaller upper ulna is fractured, then its setting is easy and its healing is quicker. When the lower ulna is fractured, its fracture is bad and its healing difficult. And the worst is if both bones are fractured. If the bone which is fractured is the smaller upper ulna,
it is necessary for the physician, when setting it, to make its extension easy and gentle until he straightens it. If the large ulna is that which is fractured, then it is necessary to make its extension stronger. And if both ulnas are fractured, then it is necessary to make the extension very much stronger.
And it is necessary that the shape of the hand, when it is set and extended, be extended upon a cushion, and the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be sitting squarely upon himself.
And let the cushion be opposite him in height, lest the patient suffer difficulty.
Then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another servant extends from above likewise. Then the physician straightens the bone until he returns it to the best shape he can. If there are fragments in the fracture of the bone, then they are removed.
Return each fragment to its place to the best of your ability. If a fragment appears that is separated and is piercing the skin, and there is no hope of setting it, then incise upon it and extract it in the manner which we have mentioned previously. If the fracture is with a wound, then a chapter has been devoted to it.
Then take the treatment of that from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of your setting, then apply a cloth with prepared kypros, rose oil, and white wax. Let it be moderate between thickness and thinness, and bind the cloth upon it gently until the swelling subsides.
Then remove the kypros and apply the prepared bandage of mill dust with egg white. Then apply the splints. Let the splint which is placed on the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger. And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most instances.
Whether the fracture was in one forearm bone or in both forearm bones together, then make your binding on the place of the fracture stronger and tighter. And as you proceed with the binding upwards or downwards, make the binding somewhat looser, as was mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, and not very hard. And let the thread with which it is bound be of special linen, moderate between thinness and thickness, as we have described. And examine the limb and bandage after a few days.
If something happens that needs to be corrected, such as itching appearing in the limb, then it should be bathed with warm water until that itching subsides. And the limb should be left unbound for a night so that it may rest, then the binding should be resumed.
If the binding has loosened and the bone has shifted or something like that, then repair all of that to the best of your ability. And look also, if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive binding, then it should be loosened a little and left for some days until nourishment reaches it, then it should be bound.
If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs to the patient, then it should not be unbound except after twenty days or so. Then, suspend the patient's hand to his neck, and let his arm be straight.  He should carefully avoid restless movements, and he should sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days; all that depends on the conditions of the temperaments and conditions of strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of a fracture of the hand and fingers.
Fractures rarely occur in the metacarpus and phalanges of the fingers; rather, contusions occur frequently.  So when a fracture or contusion occurs in the hand…
The patient should sit cross-legged, with a chair directly in front, level with him.
Then he should place his hand on it outstretched. Then the bonesmith should extend the broken bones, and the physician should straighten them until they are well-set. Then a bandage and splint should be applied, if there is no hot swelling, and then a splint should be applied over this, according to the location.
And it has been included in a soft rag.  If the fracture is towards the lower part, towards the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball from a rag and instruct the patient to grasp it with his broken hand, then tighten it with a long rag.
Let the splint be of leather, soft enough to conform to the skin with the flexion of the whole hand, and tighten it as needed. If the fracture is outward, then the splint should be placed above and another splint below in the hand so that the hand is open and erect.
Then apply the bandage as the hand rotates and interweave it between the fingers. If the fracture is in one of the finger bones, if it is the thumb, straighten it as needed, then bind it with the hand. And if you wish, make a small, upright splint to support the fracture.
And it should not move. If the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, then straighten them and bind them with the adjacent healthy finger, or bind them all together, which is better, or place a small, upright splint on them.
As we said for the thumb, and examine during and after your setting for hot inflammation; counteract it appropriately should anything of that occur, as described repeatedly.
Chapter Fourteen.
On setting a fracture of the thigh.
The thigh bone frequently breaks and is perceptible to the touch because it moves forward and backward.  Its setting is by tightening a bandage above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, the patient lying on his stomach.
Then extend each bandage evenly to its side; this if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. But if it is near the head of the thigh, then it is necessary to tighten a soft bandage, either of wool or similar.
At the head of the thigh towards the groin so that the extension is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee so that the extension is downwards. Then the physician straightens the bone with both hands until he restores it to its natural form.
And the bone unites well. Then it is necessary to maintain the bandage and tightening, unless a hot inflammation occurs in the limb. If inflammation occurs, leave it for a few days until the hot inflammation subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for tightening it, it is necessary to wrap a firm, wide turban twice or three times around the fracture, leaving the excess. Then twist the leg until the heel is at the origin of the buttock, and insert a long thread between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, the ends of the thread being above on both sides.
Then wrap the excess of the turban around the leg and thigh. Then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and place one splint on the leg bone. Then fill the space between the thigh and leg with soft rags so that the tightening is even.
Then begin strong tightening from the middle at the site of the fracture, three or four turns.  The farther the bandage is from the site of the fracture, the less strong, softer, and looser should be your tightening.
Then take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie with it the splints above. Then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the heel of the foot, and also tighten with them the ends of the splints on the other side.
So that the bandage does not move from its place. Then leave the tightening as it is, as long as no pain, swelling, or puffiness, etc., occurs in the limb. If any of this occurs, immediately untie it and correct whatever occurred, in the manner we have repeatedly mentioned.
If there is a protruding bone splinter, it should be straightened if possible. Otherwise, make an incision over it, remove it, and treat the wound as previously described until it heals.  This fracture of the thigh may also be set without adding the leg with splints.
As we mentioned in the case of the humerus and forearm, except that setting it this way does not result in lameness for the patient. However, if it is set alone, without including the leg, the patient will inevitably limp.
Know that the thigh heals in fifty days, or a little more or less, all this depending on the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the fracture of the kneecap.
Fracture of the kneecap is rare, but it is frequently contused. If it is fractured, it is either a crack or a shattering into pieces, and this occurs with or without a wound.
You will ascertain all this by touch, and you will set it by straightening the separated parts with your fingers until they are joined and united, as far as you can manage with gentleness and precision; then apply a bandage and a circular splint, if necessary.
Then tighten the appropriate bandage above, and treat all the conditions we described in other fractures, such as hot swelling and the like, by counteracting each symptom with its appropriate treatment until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the setting of fractures of the leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula;  they are subject to the same types of fracture as the bones of the arm. Therefore, its setting is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are fractured, the leg is displaced in all directions; if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is displaced forward; and if the thicker bone is fractured, and this occurs lower down, then this is something that is not hidden from you.
Therefore, use extension and reduction, and apply splints accordingly, except that if the fracture of the leg is a severe one with many fragments, the extension should be less and gentler, and you should take great care in setting it.
And in the case of the leg, there is something in addition to what is done for the arm:  when you have applied the splints and completed all your work, take two small pieces of pine wood, such as is used in planing rooms, and which is placed between the cracks in the planks, or [take pieces] from date palm leaflets or something similar.
Choose those of moderate thickness, not thin ones, and let their length be that of the leg from the knee downwards; then wrap each one twice lengthwise with a cloth, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side.
Let them extend from the knee to the lower part of the foot; then tie the two small pieces of wood in three places, at the ends and in the middle. By this means, the leg is prevented from tilting to the right or left, and is held firmly and well. A wooden gutter along the length of the leg may also be used.
It is placed in it to keep it from moving, and this is especially necessary in fractures with a wound. Then examine the leg every day, and give it the greatest care with regard to swelling, inflammation, or anything else. If anything of this sort occurs, counteract it as necessary until it heals. The bone of the leg knits in about thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
On fractures of the bones of the leg and toes.
As for the heel, fracture never occurs there; as for the bones of the leg, fracture may occur to them; and as for the toes also, fracture rarely occurs to them; rather, contusion occurs to them in most instances.
If a fracture occurs to the bones of the leg and you see that those bones have overlapped, then let the patient place his foot on the ground upright, as if walking; then you stand and place your foot on what is elevated of those bones, then tread on it and straighten it.
until they return to their places; then apply a bandage and splint from above, and place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot; then bind the foot firmly after wrapping it with cloths and everything else you need.
Then, if three or four days pass, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones straight, whether they were fractured or dislocated; the procedure is as you see. As for if some of the toes are fractured, set them and straighten them according to what I described to you in setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the fractured toe along the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider than it; then place under the foot the board that I described to you and bind it firmly; if what is fractured of the bones is two or three or more.
Then make for each toe a splint of its size, inserted into a soft cloth, and bind the board to the bottom of the foot, and let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to secure it well.
And you should not forget to attend to all that we mentioned to you in other fractures from the symptoms that we mentioned, and treat each symptom as it should be.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of the woman's pubic bone and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, seat her cross-legged, then incline her slightly backward, and let her be held from behind, then let the midwife pack her vulva with cotton until it fills it and becomes like a ball in her vulva.
Then the woman is shaken and her loins are raised little by little; then that cotton will come out until it is at the opening of the vulva like a ball, and the fracture of the bone will return. Then a pad is placed on her back. When she wants to urinate, the cotton is gently removed so that she can urinate.
And it is returned in the manner in which it was first inserted, then she returns to her original position. She does this for seven days or so, then it will heal. And if you wish, you may take a sheep's bladder, tie a tube to its mouth, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Then blow forcefully into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva; then the fracture will return. Then pack it with cotton and remain as described until it heals. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, this is used in its setting.
And its setting is as we described for the hip bone.  The correct procedure for these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, especially for someone with some experience and who understands this book well, is not hidden from you, for the fracture itself will guide you in most cases.
Understand the correct way to set and bind it. As for a man's penis if it is fractured, take a goose's gullet, insert the penis into it, then place a bandage of cloth over it and bind it, and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the setting of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Whoever suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, like the thigh bone or the humerus or similar, should immediately bleed him if the conditions for bleeding, as we have previously explained, allow.
If the wound is bleeding, you should immediately stop it by applying powdered vitriol if nothing else is available. Then set the fracture on that same day and do not delay it.
If no hot swelling occurs, then if hot swelling occurs, delay setting it until the ninth day, until the hot swelling subsides, and do not touch it at all on the third and fourth days, for bad symptoms will result.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin and exposed, you should try to gently reposition and straighten it with your hands, using a slight pull. If you cannot reposition and straighten it with your hands, reposition it with this instrument, which is an iron instrument about seven or eight fingers long. And its width should be according to the wound.
Therefore, the physician should have three or four of them, according to what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture, and let them be rounded with slight thickness, lest they bend when pressed during use.
And let the end be sharp, with a curve at its tip, and let the upper part be thicker, and from its middle to its lower part, much thinner.  This is its image:
And it is called in Greek *peron*, meaning a small lever.  The sharp, curved end should be placed on the end of the protruding bone, and it should be pushed with it gently until the bone returns and is somewhat straightened, then straighten the ends of the fracture against each other.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grasp it well, then the end of that bone should be cut until the instrument can grasp it. If you are not able to reduce the bone as we described at all, then cut it with a similar cut from those we mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws, however you can, then remove any roughness and thin scales remaining on the bone. If, after reduction, the patient feels severe, painful throbbing, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
If you are able to return it to its natural place, then do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient. When you have completed setting the bone, dip a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if it is summer, and do not apply any ointment or anything greasy to the wound.
Lest putrefaction and corruption occur in it. Then, when you have finished setting the bone, use splints and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, the size of the wound.
And beware, most carefully, of tightening the wound with the fracture, for many ignorant physicians have done this, causing their patients either death or gangrene or tetanus.  Let your binding be soft and loose, unlike the binding of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or a large wound, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he feels troubling pain in the place, then you should not apply splints; instead, make bandages of firm cloths in the place of the splints, and bind it with them.
If after a day or two you see that pus is beginning to form in the wound, remove the cloth that you placed on it with the drink, then use lint and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the tetrapharmacon and the like, and you should loosen the bandage.
And examine the wound every day, morning and evening, until it heals and closes.  The limb should be positioned so that the pus flows down easily. If many days pass and the wound does not heal and the pus does not stop, then know that there are small fragments of bone.
Then you should explore the wound with a probe; whatever of those fragments is loose, remove and extract it; and whatever is not loose, and is piercing the limb and causing pain, then aim to cut and extract it in any way you can.
If the wound suffers from inflammation, or gangrene, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then you should treat each symptom with its corresponding treatment, as previously described in its chapter.
What you should pay attention to and keep in mind is that if a large bone is broken and protrudes from a limb, such as the thigh bone, the humerus, and similar large limbs, do not attempt to pull or extract it. For death often results from such an action; rather, leave it until it putrefies, for perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
In the treatment of complications that occur after some fractures.
This complication often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially those near the joints, making the limb unsightly and perhaps preventing it from its natural function.
Examine it; if the complication is fresh, use astringent drugs such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, gum mastic, acacia, and the like. Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent syrup, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply this to the complication with a bandage and bind it tightly. Leave the bandage undisturbed for many days, then unbind it and reapply another until the complication disappears, God willing, or fasten a tight lead plate to it.
Lead has the property of removing all that is superfluous in the limbs. If the complication has hardened and become severe, and necessity dictates its removal, then incise it from above and cut away the excess growth, or shave it off with some instrument until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On the treatment of a fracture if it heals and the limb remains thin and unlike its original nature.
If a bone fracture heals and the limb remains thin and weak, this is due to many causes. One cause is excessive loosening and tightening of the bandages, or excessive tightening of the bandages preventing nourishment from reaching the limb, or excessive and repeated rubbing, or excessive movement at the wrong time, or a deficiency of blood and weakness in the patient's body.
The treatment of this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body so that his blood increases, and to use baths and to make him happy and joyful and similar things, then to apply pitch to the limb so that the pitch draws much nourishment to it, or to repeatedly rub it with lukewarm water. until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-two.
In the treatment of fractured bones which have been set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
If, after a limb has healed, a crookedness or a projection of the fractured bone, or a complication appears, and the appearance of the limb is thereby disfigured. Unless the limb is prevented from its natural function, then one should not accept the opinion of those who claim that the limb should be broken from the head, as many ignorant physicians and bone-setters in our country have done.
And this action is utterly reprehensible, leading to great harm, the least of which is disability; but if the crookedness and complication are recent, then it should be bathed in water in which emollient herbs such as mallow leaves and root, and vervain, and the like have been boiled.
And it should be bandaged with emollient bandages such as well-made diachylon, or the sap of mallow root should be taken and beaten with chicken fat and butter, and bandaged with it; or ripe figs should be taken and pounded with pigeon dung and similar medicines which are called inhibitors of consolidation.
And sometimes the complication will be resolved by constant gentle massage with the hands, and the movement of the limb in every direction at all times should be used; but if the crookedness is old and severe and has become hardened, and treatment with iron is necessary.
Then it should be incised above and the connection of the bone released, and the excess of the complication or bone should be cut with delicate cuts, and gentleness should be used with effort and care; then the wound should be treated as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
A dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, which hinders movement, disfigures the limb, and causes the patient severe pain and suffering.  If a dislocation occurs to someone, then he should immediately proceed to reduce it.
He should not delay at all, for if he delays, the place will swell and become inflamed, making it difficult to reduce the dislocation. Therefore, it should not be delayed, nor moved, nor stretched while it is swollen, because it often causes the patient spasms and harmful pains.
But if that happens, he should immediately proceed to bleed the patient, then leave him until the swelling subsides somewhat, then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reduce it, and treat each limb as mentioned in its place.
And I have also arranged the chapters on dislocations according to what preceded in fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two jaws rarely become dislocated, and their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their positions, so they relax slightly, or they are completely dislocated so that they relax completely. towards the chest, so that the saliva of the patient flows and he cannot retain it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stumbles in speech. But if the dislocation is slight, it often returns of its own accord very easily.
But if the dislocation is complete, it should be reduced quickly and not delayed at all.  The attendant should hold the head of the patient, and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside his mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
or he should insert both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and the rest of his fingers from outside to adjust it, and he should tell the patient to relax his jaw and allow it to go to every direction, and the physician should adjust the jaw and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then use a warm water and oil compress until their reduction is easy, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we said. When they have returned and become straight, and the mouth of the patient is closed and they are not relaxed, then apply to them bandages of linen with a plaster made of wax, oil, and rosewater.
Then bind it gently with a loose bandage, and let the patient sleep on his back with his head raised between two pillows so that it is not moved to the right or left, and he should not strain to chew anything, but his food should be liquid and soft.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is set, let him eat whatever he wishes, and let him use it gently and not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is set and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult, if they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, then fevers and constant headaches often result from this, and perhaps the patient's belly will become distended, and perhaps he will vomit pure bile. If you see this, then know that it is corrupted.
And many die from this within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On the reduction of the clavicle and the tip of the shoulder.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side because of its connection to the chest.  It may dislocate outwards, and this is evident to the touch. Its reduction is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms.
Then press the place with your hand firmly, and it will return. Then apply a bandage and pads and bind it. As for its end which is next to the shoulder and connected to it, it rarely dislocates; but if it dislocates at any time, then it should be reduced and set as we have mentioned and as is possible for you.
Then apply a bandage and pads and bind it, and instruct the patient to observe rest and quiet until he recovers.  With this same treatment, the tip of the shoulder is reduced if it also leaves its place.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In the reduction of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one is that it dislocates towards the armpit downwards; the second is that it dislocates towards the chest; and it may also dislocate above the shoulder, but this is rare.
It does not dislocate to the rear because of the shoulder blade, nor does it dislocate to the front because of the nerve. It most often dislocates and goes down towards the armpit, especially in those whose flesh is thin, because it comes out quickly in them and goes back in quickly.
But as for those whose flesh is abundant, it is otherwise; that is to say, it comes out with difficulty and goes back in with difficulty.  And it may happen to some people that a blow or a fall causes the shoulder to swell with a hot swelling, so that one thinks it has dislocated; it is necessary, therefore, to examine this until you ascertain its truth.
Then you proceed to its treatment.  The dislocation is recognized if it is downwards towards the armpit, for if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the sound shoulder, you find a clear difference between them, and you find the head of the shoulder to be displaced, and under the armpit, on touching, the head of the shoulder is like an egg.
And the patient is unable to raise his hand to his ear, nor to move it in all movements. Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you find this apparent to the touch, not hidden.
And this dislocation is easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  Its reduction is that a servant raises his hand upwards, then you place your thumbs under his armpit and raise the joint forcibly upwards to its place, while the servant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Then he lets it down; then it returns quickly. If it does not return by what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been some days, then the patient should bathe in hot water, and use things which relax and soften, such as cooking marshmallow root, fenugreek, and rue in water and applying it.
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool, which is moderate between soft and hard. Then the physician places his heel on the ball, and holds the patient's hand with his hand, and extends it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot; then it returns to its place. And if you wish to reduce it in this way, you bring a man taller than the patient and station him on the side, and he puts his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raises his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. And another servant pulls the patient's hand downwards towards his belly. If the patient is light, then something else should be hung on him to weigh him down; then the jaw returns immediately. And it may also be reduced in another way.
And that is to fix in the ground a long piece of wood, the head of which is round like the pestle of a mortar, neither thick nor thin. Then it is placed under the patient's armpit, after you have placed a soft cloth on the head of the wood, and the patient stands along the length of the wood.
Then you extend his hand downwards from the other side, and he also extends his body from the other side forcefully; then the joint returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult to reduce it by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment: you take a piece of wood about two cubits long. And its width is about four fingers and its thickness about two fingers; it has a round head to make it easier to enter deep into the armpit in this manner:
Then you tie a soft cloth on the round head, lest the wood hurt the patient. Then it is placed under the armpit, and the whole hand and arm are extended on the wood downwards, and the wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a crossbeam. The body is suspended by the crossbeam and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side. Then the joint enters immediately.  If it enters in any way possible, then a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared bandage of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the whole shoulder as it extends upwards, then the ball is firmly tied under the armpit, and the bandage is wound over it from above, and his hand is suspended to his neck.
He is left without moving his hand for seven days, and the patient's food should be light so that the limb may strengthen and heal more quickly. Then, after seven or five days, it is untied and exercised; if it is firm and does not weaken, then it is healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to dampness or other cause, cauterization with three cauteries should be used as previously described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this is done and the bandage is removed after seven days and the joint is not stable,
the bandage and binding are repeated several times, but it does not stabilize, and it falls and weakens, and you cannot raise it upwards. Know then that the nerve in the head of the humerus is severed, stretched or weakened. Know then that the joint will never stabilize in its place.
As for a dislocation towards the chest and breast and backwards, it is reduced by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns, and the rest of the binding and treatment are used until it heals. If after healing there is stiffness in the limb and slowness of movement,
the patient should use the bath repeatedly until that stiffness softens and returns to its original nature.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
In the treatment of elbow dislocation.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty also.  It dislocates in all directions, especially forwards or backwards. Its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is visible and palpable, whichever way it is dislocated.
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one, this will be clearly evident to you by the deformity of the joint; and he cannot bend the arm nor touch his shoulder with it.  You should hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot inflammation occurs.
For if a hot inflammation occurs, its reduction is difficult, and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backwards; for this is the worst of all types of dislocation, and the most painful, and often death ensues.
And its reduction, if it is possible to be reduced, is that an assistant extends his hand with both hands and his arm extended, and the physician's hands are above and below the elbow, and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of both hands, or with the base of his palms, until it returns to its place.
And as for if the dislocation is forward, it may be reduced by bending the arm sharply until the base of the hand strikes the corresponding shoulder; and if the dislocation does not return, then use very strong traction, which is that two assistants extend the arm.
And two assistants also hold the patient so that he does not move during the traction; then the arm is rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or a wide bandage around his hand. And if the physician touches the joint with his hands, he should lubricate them with ointment so that it will help in easily sliding the joint.
Then he pushes the joint strongly until it returns; and after its return, it is necessary to apply a bandage containing astringents and desiccant with egg white, and it is bound tightly, and the arm is hung from the patient's neck, and it is left for several days.
Then it is untied; and if the joint is fixed in its place, then untie the bandage from it and leave it. And if you see that the joint is not strengthened well, then reapply the bandage and leave it also for several days until it is strengthened, then untie it. And if a swelling occurs after the return of the joint and its untying,
and difficulty in movement occurs, then use moistening in the bath and gentle massage and rubbing until it softens; or place a fat ram's caul on the joint, then bind it and leave it on for a day and night, then remove it and put him in the bath.  And when he sweats, massage the joint moderately.
Then reapply the caul once, twice, and three times with the bath until it softens. And if you wish to apply a moist, thin ox caul with fat and bind it on, do that several times, for it will soften and return to its former state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
In the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist often dislocates, and its reduction is easier than that of other joints, except that it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the time it dislocates, before the place becomes swollen or a hot swelling appears.
To reduce it, place the patient's wrist on a board and have an assistant extend his hand. The physician should place his hand on the prominence of the joint and push it until it returns. However, he should look to see if the dislocation has gone towards the palm of the hand.
If the dislocation is prominent towards the back of the hand, let him place the palm of his hand on the board during extension and reduction. If the dislocation is prominent toward the back of the hand, let him place the back of his hand on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the prominence of the joint itself. If it returns immediately, well and good; otherwise, bind it with a bandage that soothes the swelling.
And leave it; do not manipulate it again, for it will not tolerate it, and you will not be able to reduce it after a few days have passed, except that the joint will remain crooked, and it will not harm the patient except if the hand becomes weak and unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that a nerve has been severed or bruised; there is no remedy for this except cauterization, which may or may not help.  When the wrist is reduced, apply the bandage we described, then tighten it and leave it for five days.
Then unbind it and exercise the hand. If its movement is difficult and there is any stiffness, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter twenty-nine.
In the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may be dislocated in any direction. If a finger is dislocated towards the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns. Then bind the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the direction in which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it is straight that day. If it is night, bind it in the same way; continue to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; bind it towards that same direction and do as you did before until it heals.  Do the same if it is dislocated in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
In the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
If a vertebra of the vertebrae of the back or neck is dislocated, a complete dislocation, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, then there is no treatment, for death quickly comes to the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's stool is passed involuntarily; he cannot restrain it, and often some of his limbs become relaxed, either his legs or his arms, or one of them.  But if one vertebra is displaced from its place, it often returns.
And its displacement is in four directions; that which is displaced backward is called a hump. As for its treatment, you should look; if the hump has occurred from youth, then there is no treatment for it, nor is there any cure at all. But that which has occurred from a fall or a blow, and the like.
The ancients mentioned it with various treatments in lengthy descriptions, most of which is not beneficial. I have shortened this, so that a little of it suffices for much of what they brought, by approaching the meaning and explaining it, and I have depicted the instrument differently from what they explained and described.
So I say that the hump which occurs in the front of the chest has no remedy and no cure for it; and the same for those on both sides also. Only that which occurs in the back is treated, specifically with what I describe, which is that you extend the patient on his face.
on a level bench near a wall, and spread a wet mat underneath so that his chest is not harmed. Then place an upright wooden post fixed in a hole in the ground at one end of the bench towards his head, and another wooden post towards his feet at the other end of the bench.
And a servant holds the post, and let it not be secured in the hole, and another servant holds the other in that manner. Then wrap around the patient's chest and under his armpits with a soft, tight bandage, and extend the end of the bandage to the post at his head and tie it there.
Then tighten with another bandage above his hips and above his knees and at his ankles. Then gather all the bandages and tie them to the other post at his feet. Then each servant pulls his post with the bandage, and the two posts do not move from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not fixed, as we said. And the physician places his hands on the hump with force until it returns, or he places a board on it, then leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits.
And dig into the wall, which we said should be near the patient, a place into which the end of the board is inserted. Then place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls strongly until he compresses the hump.
And it returns to its place. And if you wish to make it with a screw that is twisted by hand, it is that you plant in the ground at the head of the patient at the end of the shop two posts, their length being a cubit, and at his feet at the end of the shop also two posts.
Let the distance between each post be a span. And a hole is made in each post through which the screw passes. And all the wood is firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all. And insert a round rod, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two posts.
And at its end is a hole in which a rod a span long is fixed with what is twisted. And in the other two posts likewise. Then tighten the bandage which you tightened on the chest of the patient in the screw which is at his head, and the bandages which you tightened on his legs in the screw which is at his feet.
Then a servant stands at each screw, twisting his hand with the handle with which he twists the screw, and the physician levels the hump as we have previously explained. And this is an image of the screw, the shop, and the patient:
Then, after the vertebra returns and the place is level, it should be necessary to apply a dry bandage with egg white, then a splint, then place on top of the bandage a splint of a board whose width is three fingers or thereabouts, and its length is as much as takes the place of the hump.
And on some sound beads, then it is bound with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers. If some protrusion remains in the place at the end of healing, then it is necessary to use medicines that relax and soften, along with the use of the board we described for a long time.
And a lead plate may be used in that. And a protrusion may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that is an extra bone that has protruded. Do not treat it with this treatment, for perhaps death will occur.
Chapter thirty-one.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and they are not subject to what happens to the other joints of slight displacement and depression, and the hip joint is dislocated in four ways.
That is, it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards, and most often it is dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards. And the sign of its dislocation inwards is that if you compare the sound leg of the patient with the affected leg, it will be longer.
And the knee will be more prominent than the sound one, and the patient will not be able to bend his leg at the groin, and the area next to the groin will be clearly swollen because the head of the femur has gone there.
And the sign of that which is dislocated outwards is that its symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms. And the sign of that which is dislocated forwards is that he extends his leg completely, but he cannot bend it without pain being in the knee, and if he wants to walk, he cannot do so forwards.
And his urine is retained, and his groin is swollen, and when walking, his footfall is on the heel. And the sign of that which is dislocated backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
And the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly at the position of the loin. As for the reduction of the types of this dislocation, you should look, for if the dislocation is old, has become chronic with its sufferer, and its reduction has not been attempted, and it has remained in its state, then there is absolutely no treatment for it.
It should not be exposed to it. As for that which is recently dislocated, and whatever type it is of the four aspects of dislocation, then hasten to twist the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it right and left, perhaps...
it returned and did not need any other treatment. If it does not return like this, then it is necessary to prepare a strong, capable assistant who will extend his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied around his leg above the knee, and another assistant who will extend it from above.
by inserting his hands under his armpits, then tightening a soft bandage around the top of the thigh, and another third assistant holding the end of the bandage, and his extension is either from the front, from the groin towards the clavicle, or from behind towards the back.
And their extension is all at once, until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains suspended. For this type of extension is a common type for the four types. If the dislocation returns as we have said, otherwise, each type needs what I mention of specific treatment.
As for its specific reduction, if the dislocation is inwards, then the patient should lie on his sound side, then a bandage is applied to the top of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the area under the groin.
Then the bandage is extended upwards from the groin towards the upper body towards the clavicle, then another strong, capable assistant takes it with his arms and embraces the thick part of the affected thigh and extends it outwards with a strong pull, then it returns to its place.
And this type is easier than all the other types of treatment by which this member is reduced. If it is difficult for you and it does not respond to this type of treatment at all, then the patient's legs should be tied together with a strong, soft bandage on the heels and on the knees.
And the distance between each and its fellow is four fingers, and the affected leg is extended more than the other by two fingers. Then the patient is suspended by the head from a wooden beam that is in the house, and his distance from the ground is two arms' lengths.
Then you order a strong boy to embrace the head of the thigh, and another boy hangs onto the patient, and the other boy embracing the thigh pushes strongly, then the joint returns to its place quickly.  As for its specific reduction if the dislocation is outwards…
The patient should lie on the bench as we described for the hunchback, and the bandage is tightened on his affected leg in particular and on his chest. Then the two pieces of wood are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head. Then an extra piece of wood is placed in the middle of the bench, very firmly secured.
Wet rags are wrapped around it so that it does not harm the patient. The wood is placed between his thighs so that he does not slip downwards when pulled. Then each servant pulls towards his side, and the physician sets the hip with his hands. If it responds to reduction…
Otherwise, place the board on him and press it down as we mentioned for the hunchback, except that the patient should lie on his sound side. And if the dislocation is forwards, then the patient's leg should be extended once he is in this same position on the bench.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected hip, then presses it with his other hand, and with that he makes the pressure extended downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is backwards, then the patient should not be extended downwards.
He is raised off the ground, but should be placed on something firm.  As should also be the case if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we mentioned of his lying on the bench on his face, and the bandages tightened.
As we said before, and the pressure with the board should also be used on the place to which the joint has gone. When the hip joint has returned completely to its proper place—and the sign of its return will not be hidden from you— you extend the patient's legs.
If you see them even, and the patient bends and extends the leg without difficulty, then know that the member has returned to its proper place. Then, bring the thighs together, apply the bandage, and bind it with a turban firmly so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days. Then untie the bandage, and compare the leg with the other. If you see them equal in size, then know that the fracture has healed, and allow the patient to walk.  If you see any relaxation in it,
then return and bandage and tighten it according to your first tightening, and leave it also for three days. Then untie it, and let him walk slowly on it for days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-two.
In the treatment of fracture of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways: inwards, outwards, and downwards—that is, backwards; it is never dislocated forwards.  The sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to bring his leg to his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. The method of setting all types of its dislocation is that you seat the patient sitting with his legs extended if he is able to do so, and a servant sits behind him to hold his waist and twist him slightly backwards, then you sit on his thighs.
And you place your back against his face and put his leg between your legs, then you grasp his knee with your hands and interlock them between your fingers on his knee, then you press the sides of his knee strongly with your hands, and another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
The sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh softly without constraint. Then bandage it and fasten the leg to the thigh, then bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.  He should only do a little walking for a few days until it strengthens.
If you are unable to return it by what we have described, then use strong traction with the bandages which I have previously described in the treatment of the hip until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel may be displaced slightly, or it may be completely dislocated.  Its dislocation is either inwards or outwards, and the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and prominent on the side to which it is dislocated.
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to reduce it; this is done by gently extending it with the hands and straightening it until it returns.  As for its treatment if it is completely dislocated, then the patient should sit down, and a strong servant should hold him from behind his back at his waist.
Then you grasp his foot with your right hand from above, and with your left hand from below the foot at the place of the heel; then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left twice; then extend it with your left hand and push the front of the foot with your right towards the leg without violence.
Do this twice as we have described; then push the front of the foot towards the leg on the third time while you are pulling at the heel. If it returns in one or two times in this way and you see the foot is straight, otherwise repeat the procedure, for it will return.
If it refuses to return by what we have described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground, and fix a strong wedge in the ground between his thighs, having wrapped a cloth around it so that it does not hurt the patient; then a servant should hold his thigh.
Then another servant extends the leg, either with his hands or with a rope tied around the neck of the leg; then each servant extends in the opposite direction to his companion, and the wedge remains between the patient's thighs, holding him so that his body does not be pulled downwards during the extension; then the physician straightens the joint with his hands.
And another servant holds the healthy leg below, for the joint returns quickly; when the joint has returned and you have ascertained the correctness of its return, apply the compress and bandage, and tighten it with firm bandages, and bind the foot with a bandage below; and you should guard against the nerve which is above the heel from behind.
lest the bandage be tight upon it and hurt him; then leave it two or three days; if the bandage loosens, tighten it, then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and the patient must abstain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this time, you cannot be sure that the joint will not be dislocated again and become spoiled, and will not accept treatment afterwards; if a hot swelling appears, you should use for its alleviation what we have previously described in another place in the treatment and cleansing, until it disappears.
Chapter thirty-four.
In the treatment of a dislocated toe.
You should set what is dislocated with a slight extension without force, and this is not difficult, but easy; if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the instep, the patient should place his foot on a level surface of the ground.
Or on a board while he is standing as if walking, then you stand and place your foot on the dislocated joint, then press down on it forcefully until it returns and you see that it is straight and there is no prominence in the place.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot that takes the whole foot, having two ends, then bind it tightly and firmly for three days, then unbind it and keep him from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are safe from recurrence, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation which occurs with a wound, or with a fracture, or with both together.
When something of that happens and you delay its treatment and setting, it often ends in death.
Therefore, no one should undertake the treatment of such a thing except one who is skillful in the craft, long experienced, gentle, compassionate, careful, not rash or impetuous, and that he should use in the beginning only those medicines which soothe hot swellings and leave the patient alone.
As for the power of God, except what you hope for its safety from harm with the mildness of the disease and some hope appears to you in it, then return it from your hand at the first, before the hot swelling happens.
If the limb returns to what you want, then use the treatment which soothes hot swellings and treat the wound with what is suitable for it from drying ointments; if the dislocation is with a fracture and there are detached splinters in the bone, then remove them. And follow in that what we mentioned in the simple diseases, what preceded in their places.
And strive your best and avoid entering the path of risk, as I have advised you before, for that is more lasting for your reputation and safer for your honor, God willing.
