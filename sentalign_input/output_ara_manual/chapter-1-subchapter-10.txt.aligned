On cauterizing for epilepsy.	On cauterizing for epilepsy.	1.0
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm should be cauterized.  First, his brain should be cleansed with strong purgatives and all the other treatments that we mentioned in the appropriate section, if the patient is an adult and can tolerate taking the medications.	The epileptic who may be cauterized is he whose epilepsy arises from phlegm. When the patient is an adult and can stand taking the drugs, he should first purify his brain by great electuaries and the rest of the treatment mentioned in that section.	0.8550259
If, however, he is a child who cannot tolerate medications, he should use gargles and masticatories that cleanse the brain for many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.	But if it be a boy unable to tolerate the drugs he should employ gargles and medicaments to chew, to clear his brain, for several days beforehand, with an improvement in his diet.	0.87910736
Then his head is shaved, and then cauterize him with a single cautery in the middle of the head, as described previously in the instructions, and another cautery at the back of his head. And on each side of his head, a cauterization. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize him with the cauterizations mentioned for the one who suffers from hemiplegia and looseness of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back.  The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.	Then let his head be shaved and burn him with the single cauterization on the middle of the head in the manner described before, and with one cauterization on the occiput, and one on each frontal prominence; and, if the patient be fit and able to bear it, add those additional cauterizations on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae that we have already described for paralysis and for flaccidity. The cautery should be olivary, the shape before described.	0.89180565
If the patient is a child, make the cautery delicate, in this manner.	If the patient be a boy, use a fine cautery.	0.7730528
