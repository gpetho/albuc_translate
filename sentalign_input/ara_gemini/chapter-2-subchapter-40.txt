The fortieth chapter: in it is made of the discussion about lancing tumors and incising them.
Tumors are of many various types, as will be mentioned one by one in this book, and they differ in their lancing and incising in two aspects: one is the type of tumor itself and the humors it contains.
The second aspect is the location in the body where they occur, because a tumor occurring in the head is different from a tumor occurring in the anus, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy area is different from a tumor occurring in a joint, each one having its own treatment rule.
Some tumors should not be lanced until the pus in them has matured and is complete, and some should be lanced while they are fresh and have not fully matured, such as tumors that are close to the joints, because if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition prolongs until what is around it putrefies, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing chronicity of that limb, or the tumor may be near a major organ, so if you delay its lancing until it matures, you will harm that major organ, or it may be near the anus, so you lance it fresh.
It is necessary to lance the fresh, not fully matured tumor that is near the anus so that the depth does not putrefy and penetrate into the anus, becoming a fistula and becoming incurable.
You should know the time to lance tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and other signs.
The lancing should be performed at the lowest point of the tumor if possible, so that it is easier for the fluid to flow downwards, or at the thinnest and most protruding point of the tumor.
The lancing should be lengthwise along the body if the tumors are in areas such as the hands and feet, muscles, tendons, nerves, arteries, and in general in all flat areas without bending.
As for those that bend, the lancing should be done according to that area. If the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is best to leave it until it is fully matured, as we have said, because if you lance it before that, the flow of pus from it will be prolonged and it will be very harmful and dirty, and perhaps its edges and depth will harden.
Some tumors may be lanced across the body when necessary or according to the needs of the limb.
You should use a single lancing for small tumors and a wide lancing or multiple incisions for large tumors, according to the size of the tumor.
Some tumors may require the skin to be scraped and cut if it has become like a rag and is dead, such as what occurs in many boils and abscesses.
Some are incised with a three-cornered incision, some are cut in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like inguinal tumors, and some use a circular or crescent-shaped incision, and so on.
Those that do not have a head, such as smooth, flat tumors, should only be lanced simply.
If the tumor is large and has accumulated a lot of fluid and you lance it, you should not rush to remove all the pus at that time, but rather remove some of it, then bandage the tumor until the next day, then remove some more pus, doing this gradually until you remove all of it, especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a small child, or an elderly person, because the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden removal of pus, so the patient may die without you realizing it, so be very careful about this.
After lancing these tumors, you should wipe the wound and examine it. If the wound of the tumor is small or the incision is single and simple, use linen or worn cotton thread. If the tumor is large and the incisions are numerous, you should insert a wick into each incision until they reach each other.
If some of the skin of the tumor has been cut or scraped, you should fill it with worn cotton or linen lint without moisture and bandage it until the third day, then remove it and treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a linen cloth in them and applying it to the bleeding area several times.
If the bleeding continues, you should use the management, treatment, and peaks that we have described in many places in this book and in the division.
If you are in the winter season and the location of the tumor is rich in nerves, you should moisten the pads with hot wine and oil and place them on the area.
If you are in the summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply pads soaked in cold water and oil or cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said, then you should untie the tumor, wipe it, and use similar treatment until it heals.
This is what you need to know about the treatment of tumors in general. As for the detailed method, I have mentioned each tumor and how to treat it, categorized and summarized.
