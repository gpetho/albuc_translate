Oh children, you have completed this book, which is the culmination of your scientific knowledge in medicine and as showcased by what you've learned from it, I see that you understand complex concepts related to surgery, a topic dissected within these pages for those studying or interested.
When the operation is prostrated in our region and at all times privately, until I witness it myself; only some small descriptions are made by free Antics, which I change into their errors and heath concerns, whereby clauses of such matters become clear to me, and thus my understanding deepens.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May be the reason why not to abandon our craft in this time, as medicine is long and it'supeserves its actor by exercising within the science of anatomy which Gualia understands inside their knowledge about the proper joint movements and forms of these parts; including bone structure (osseous system), nerves, muscles (lacertz/tendons), names of them all, as well as circulatory dynamics in pulsing veins and steady ones.
Through the water of Hippocrates that is by name made, may it work in small ways and mainly through the hand's skill.
May we already have said about this in the entrance of this book; who do not know what has been told to them herein regarding anatomy, will fall into error and perish as mortals, even if they have seen much of these things, which are formed within this science and taken from its knowledge through experimentation.

Here's a possible The second chapter concerning cauterization and puncturing, as well as the use of drains and purgatives for those things therein described; all have been arranged in terms of their respective tools (translation may vary slightly depending on interpretation). Here's a line-by-line translation:

When you examine the quality of that lancet and its non-usefulness here in this part, where using a lancet is forbidden.
So that the speech about the quality of cautery and the non-essential parts is long and elaborate due to science and secrets; they argue greatly among themselves, and for me just a small part of their discussions suffices as I am weary from lengthy debates.
And therefore it is said that the cautery comforts all of the body universally, except for two kinds of matter within its own material, which are considered tail ends of the substance.
In the complexity of a dry and dehydrated body substance; they pour out that which is appropriate for it thereupon, while others apply what is inappropriate to it whereby treatment with fluid applied therapy becomes necessary due to its qualitative nature and lack of moisture. The essence (nature) of the focus (body part affected by dryness or dehydrsation - likely referring to a specific organ, such as the bladder which in Latin is 'vesica') itself has both quality and dryness; hence treatment with fluid applied therapy becomes necessary for it.
Here comes the first sentence to translate:
And according to that speech of his, I have already discovered some things for myself.
Even if there is no need to withdraw it now that has already been probed and exercised in the capital of cautery practices for today's exercise, understand the complexity of human composition and how diseases are arranged within their bodies, as well as the causes of these conditions and the timing of them.
May also occur in other complexities, not due to fear but rather from excessive moist and cold humors, which is why all doctors are agreed upon them, and they will never resort to bleeding for treatment in these cases.
Indeed, sons and daughters of healing by the blade at its focus are employed in medicine to burn out diseases; whereby this very point is simple, for which reason it reaches only that member being cauterized and does not affect another limb or part thereof but inflicts merely a small harm.
May the medicine burn reach that in their limbs which is weakened by it, and forcefully bring relief to the ill member who suffers from difficult healing.
May the focus, due to its sublimity and beneficial substance, not do so but overflow E even now we understand through experimentation and long-standing servitude of study in this art regarding truth about causes; thus it spares one from lengthy discourse A if I am not free at this rest stop to reveal my secret aim concerning the focus, which is operation on the body's parts where illnesses are expelled through said practice - a philosophical demonstration that sharpens our wits in these matters.
And as scholthyards (or fools), who diverge from the appropriate time for performing cauterizations and interruptions, come at the very beginning of spring.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: "And it is said that cautery is convenient at all times, for then the harm from accidents gets submerged in the water wherein the cautery has been directed and mainly when cautery is used or necessary pills/ointments, which do not suffer delay due to fear of those who heal improperly; it'thy greater than minor harm entering through time.
So do not sit on your knees or feet; ordinary people and physicians only estimate them as common grounds for the disease that is healed by caustics but cannot be completely eliminated due to interruptions in treatment (and thus leads to recurrence).
E the cause is not for wanton reasons why they seek treatment; rather, it'sin medical context where treatments alter complexity and evaporate the fluids which are causes of pain that come about.
Even though there may be excess caution on medicine due to the patient'dicts health and vigor of their operation, it is important not to overdo interventions unnecessarily.
It is possible that the patient's illness may return at some time in their condition, depending on the complexity of the disease and its location within them; if cautery has been prepared for excess fluids inside them as a result of these causes, then it could prevent further pain from arising there. Alternatively, with tooth-like instruments used for alleviating pain and symptoms related to this cause here in their body (possibly referring to the foot or other small inflamed areas), such intervention may stop that particular discomfort from returning.
Even though it may be vulgar speech that certain instruments are used in medicine (and not the language I understand), these we consider healing tools, which none of them can fully achieve through medicine or due to other reasons beyond my comprehension as a physician.
The cause is contrary to water; I understand that the instruments of healing are only used when administering remedies for certain illnesses, and these medicines do not confer benefit on their own—rather it's at the root of the cause where a physician applies cautery. Here come the first source sentence to translate: And now that we have applied our medical remedies here, according to what I understand by common sense and sometimes used by physicians too.

When in the entire head there is chronic and long-lasting pain, and it extends into the spleen (assuming 'malaute' refers to an organ like the liver or bowels), using knives, lancets, scalpels, cauterizing tools, gauze pads, bandages, cufflinks/jewelry for decoration purposes—and mostly if any form of previous caustic has already been applied on that which causes such pain; and not as a great mutilation or cruelty (assuming 'mot gran freg' refers to significant harm), then consider whether the spleen itself is made from excessive bile in its nature. And furthermore, apply another form of cauterization immediately for this one [organ]. Return that instrument over the patient's head bone (likely meaning skull) for burning inside where the spinal cord is split apart. Incis the ribcage and reveal the bone quantity we have recorded and apply that same cauterization to the part of the back where it is being called upon, which is also where the bellows (ventus) are operated. And apply your hand firmly, and do not discover the bones, for when humidity excessively attacks causing great pain different from that of all other burns on the head.

Of ancient wound treatment, or with a healing touch that resembles antiquity'dictory: A compendium on medical practices rooted in the
When pain arises in the joint or bone within a limb's movement, and internal bleeding occurs due to illnesses; it is through medicine that healing agents are applied directly into their wounds—either immediate surgical intervention with sharp instruments like knives ('cauterization'), or cauterization by means of iron tools. Here the dual methods for addressing such injuries become clear: either swift action to remove foreign objects and halt bleeding, or heat application using metal implements as remedies in various parts affected by diseases—without fail, medical intervention through these two forms is essential.
May cuisene (use) the medicine as a kind of cauldron, and take that out; remove both hands from each other'se ends. And mark the location of pain on the temple with one lancing knife inside where it is hidden within for cutting purposes.
Here comes the translation for each line:
Return that which is inside it into healing care.
If you come, apply some of these hot remedies that you have written about in the book on medicine-heating treatments.
May the use of a hot iron for cautery be as follows in this method:
and it is called a clasped claw (claw-like form), where the head of the patient' extricates itself in such manner as to stand out prominently at that place, which we call its small peak.
Return the pause over the location of pain, and hold your hand—so that it is not possible for the splinter to come out which has just been inserted hastily—and rotate the small iron gently by speed.
If the amount of blood that has accumulated through stooling is reached at the point where your hand must be placed to ensure that the artery does not become obstructed, thus preventing bile flow blockage.
Return the swelling to the water of salt and rest it there for three days, then apply pressure at the border, and take care that its inside is healed.
If you go, then anneal the end of the lancet according to other cauterizations and be careful not to cut into this artery which is still freshly bled out properly.

Here you're suggesting to apply pressure with your palm (or using an instrument like tweezers), through these points where impacts have been made, allowing the healing agent – possibly salve derived from herbs or other remedies applied during treatment sessions—to penetrate deep into the affected bone structure.

When an earache causes pain due to fluid accumulation or other irritative factors and it is discussed in the division (section) of treatment that you have mentioned herein, heat application with cauterization tools such as a lancet/pincer used for this purpose remains effective; these are referred to as "cauterizing instruments".

When you treat the medicinal herb for wound cleaning and purgation without hindering your treatment, remember that when cauterizing a disease: use three types of caustics – one must be gold fleam (a type of antimicrobial), secondly apply small amounts as needed with their templets; lastly use the union of two lips for application. Here we are dealing not just with remedies but also specific applications and techniques involving these therapeutic agents, which reflects how medieval practitioners approached treatment through a combination of methods including cauterization using various substances like gold fleam (possibly referring to metallic mercury), templets or poultices, indicating an intricate understanding of both materials and their curative properties. The mentioning highlights the personalized application method where bodily secretions are used as part of healing practices in addition to external substances for cauterization – a testament to historical medical knowledge that combined empirical experience with therapesean traditions specific to

The translation for this line is: "Apply cold to the head of phlegm and perform that same branding at the top where it was previously done using a hot lancet as directed by custom, while another instrument performs burning on their forehead; they apply cauterization also along each horn." Here in English, this likely means applying something (possibly cold compresses) to address phlegm or excess fluids ("phlogma") accumulating at the head. The procedure involves repeated branding using a hot lancet where it was done before and additional burning is applied on their forehead along with cauterization techniques used all around each horn (likely referring metaphor If the humors are strong and enduring, then you will apply these same caustics to them, which causes paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the back and those of the chest.

When the patient's hair turns into particles and flickers (or strikes), two types of treatments follow: either using these as points to strike or applying heat for medical purposes such as curing, this line suggests an approach in medieval medicine that involved direct physical interaction with perceived substances causing ailment. It indicates procedures where body hair could be seen turning into something abnormal (possibly due to illness) and are then treated either by striking them—a form of manual therapy or as part of other healing practices like applying heat, perhaps through some rudimentary comb
If you use a lamp (source of heat), command the malady to draw out its hairs along with those that are already present in their world, keeping them extended and bound together; if your finger presses on what they reject or dismiss from themselves, then bind these patient's strands tightly using one bandage so it doesn’thy intoxicated state within the hair growth. This line elaborates further a medieval treatment that involves binding (likely with cloth) of unwanted physical manifestations—referred to as 'hairs', perhaps symptoms like rashes or blemishes, and pulling them out through pressure by fingers while using heat from an external source possibly for curative purposes in the absence of modern medication. It suggests a holistic approach where both existing issues (indicated here with ‘present’) are addressed simultaneously along with emerging problems as they occur ('dismiss' or 'reject'), binding them to prevent further dissemination within their body and possibly reducing distress by containing the physical symptoms that

This line suggests that if certain issues like unwanted facial hair return due to imbalances addressed by cautery during an earlier phase of care ("primoenment"), further specific interventions are necessary, following a systematic approach similar to what was initially applied.

When you cauterize the fistula that we have discussed in relation to diseases and do not provide your treatment, then indeed what you are doing is following this method: command the malady (presumably referring to body humors or fluids causing illness) within it inside its own body.

Then pause over the area where the punctures have been made with caustic substances to anchor the humors in tranquility and prevent any further dislocation of those organs until comfort is achieved. (Here 'cautery' refers to a treatment involving heat or chemicals applied via small, targeted punctures; anchoring the humors relates to balancing bodily fluids as per medieval medical understanding.)
If the dislocation occurs below (this implies an area possibly related to muscle or bone structures); then apply caustic treatment directly on the affected muscle with cauterizing needles, which will confirm and release moisture/humidity therein; hence restoring health of those humors. ('Confirming' likely means stabilization by localized heating from each puncture or application), 'consolidation effect', as per the context provided in medieval medicine where cauterizing was a method to restore balance and eliminate excessive moistures believed responsible for disorders (here, addressing what would today be understood as muscle inflammation).

Perform one application on each joint using a pointed lancet (as per quantity), two more applications to the hips’ regions where this condition manifests, ensuring fluid evacuation through purification; elongate among those not yet aligned or corrected—this will formulate three cauterization methods: firstly directed at individual limb joints with a sharp instrument (one for each affected area), second and third are applied to the hip areas where distension may arise, promoting drainage of excess fluids.

From this fragment, it seems like the context is related to a medical procedure on abdominal wounds:
When intestinal contents are pushed out due to overindulgence and excess moisture, it is the digestive and retaining function of these organs that suffer in the stomach and bowels; they heal through treatments at their hands without interfering, except when an obstruction brings forth bile via cautery. At this point, large cauterization occurs on one's stomach as preceded by previous treatment of the stomach itself, followed by circumcision and four additional small caustic treatments within the delicate boundaries under the skin; external application or two forms of cautery are also applied to flatulent overgrowth above bony prominency.
If you see excessive humidities and the malady exhudes them, then you will apply cautery on that area as well as over the intestines (budels), and firmly adjusting those cauteris upon the stomach and above the thighs, it is a complete healing of which there can be no mistake.

When pain is in the part of anguish (sciatica), and it's caused by excess fluid and heat, doctors used water they have mentioned before that does not worsen the condition, which are old poultices or artificial pillows; therefore apply cauterization to that area.
The manipulation of the cautery in that second use is either a medicine'se fire or its point.

If you wish, burn am the circle where it was previously prayed for in the cauterization of the displacement of the ankle; that very same circular area should be burnt completely along with all parts of the knee joint.
This is how it happens with caustic application when the pain clings to the joint and does not extend into the groin area.
If you extend into the thigh, then apply both caustic points over that location where the humors enter and cause pain—and with one lancet prick four times on each side of this area to address its exterior portion.
If there are pointed cauteries used and their depth corresponds to the length of the cannon (a term that could refer to a medical instrument or measurement in this context), then:

For the treatment of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And when gout (cause of joint pain) is treated with medicine and there are no remaining pains, then the poultices will heal them.
When you are caustering that particular elimination in the circulatory channel of the joint between foot and thigh, using various types of cautery instruments.
That is the form of this tool: (referred to as) olive cautery
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery for that purpose. If pain enters the joints or other points of connection, and movement causes it to intensify there, then apply cautery at any point where such discomfort occurs; with three to four treatments using this cauterism across the entire body part affected by these pains.
If there are hot lances needed for these treatments, then heat those that you need and do not press too hard with your hand on the area previously treated; use only as much force required to insert them into the wound entrance of the cleft (of the nose).
If pain enters into both shoulders (the chest and the back), then administer the points we have just mentioned in this chapter.
If the pains are limited solegy only to the limbs and it is called sourness, then prick in the circulation of the hotbeds shall be done along these two lines.
If there are residual pains in the joints, then make points on the circumference of each bone and over every knob or spike; here is where pain often persists after treatment for gout.
If joint or muscle pain comes upon the thighs or muscles during certain days, then you will perform caustic treatments on all parts of those who help (patients/assistants).
And if the melancholy is not expelled by a good diet and medicine intake, even then it may be removed with this instrument of healing; God helps.

For the treatment of leprosy, which translates to "In treating leprosy." in English
Some cases of leprosy require large-scale treatment using caustic agents with great care and only slightly if the species causing leprosy is due to decayed blood and melancholy (this line suggests a medieval or historical interpretation linking specific causes, like humoral imbalances involving "blood" - possibly referring metaphorically here as rotten flesh leading to putrefaction) with different caustic substances. The term 'lebros' may refer to leprosy and the approach
When you intend to caustically treat that one (referring possibly to an affected area or lesion), consider if the leprosy is caused by moisture and take into account only what we have discussed previously in division about cauterization required: on top of the head where applied, near the back part undernethy's hair; also over two bunions (which may refer to swollen areas at the base of the big toe or elsewhere); behind one point and between servitz/service devices.
And your hand inside the instrument holds a small incision, and their bones are displaced from there, so that the escape of thick fumes is removed by it; and you will then cauterize over the wound as requested.
If the leprosy has already spread over the thigh and shows manifestations, then you must cauterize that part with these lances we have here for head purposes; also apply cauterization to the extremity of the nose, two on each waist (hips), two upon the vertebrae in the backbone, two above the spinal processes belonging to this one's thorax region and another over any remaining lumbar or cervical vertebrae. Also place lances on both ankles, a lance for every possible joint of your body; cauterize that part at all articulations in limbs and feet as well as each heel under the patient'sin shoes/footwear.
Guard your nerves which are above the ankle such that they do not burn them down here (with a cautery or similar tool).
Some treatments involve applying a pointed cautery to the patient' extrémités (hands and feet), as well as their mouth (stomach area) and genitals (possibly referring to male or female reproductive organs). Here is the translation line by line:

In this given text from what appears to be an old medical treatise
The provided Latin-influenced phrase "Capitol" seems out of context for a specific translation into English regarding
When the patient suffers with vomiting of bile and is turning upside down (potentially indicating cholera or severe gastroenteritis where profuse, copious vomiting occurs), it necessitates cauterizing that area within their digestive circuit as they roll around. This implies an urgent medical intervention to stop the flow of bile and potentially life-threatening dehydration or further complications due to severe
Therefore, they examine the wounds that have been already treated with cautery on this day at dawn; I might not witness it myself but fear there may be an ulcer present and yes, some leaks or drips are visible too. This suggests a post-treatment assessment by medical practitioners to check for any healing issues such as bleeding from the cauterized wounds (ulcers), indicating that further care might need attention if there is evidence of leakage – possibly requiring additional intervention or treatment adjustments based on these observations.
There is a place where the patient has been previously subjected to cautery within their digestive tract or in other locations (circumstances are not clear without more context), either here at this very moment when we speak with them, which could imply an immediate response required due to wounds being treated now – possibly referring back to areas near the mouth where treatment might occur if it's related

From what you've given, "Capitol .liii." appears to begin a line related to the topic
The provided Latin-like sentence translates into English as: "Corrosion is the wandering decay within the limb; it consumes you like dry wood shavings at a fire." This translation suggests that corrodents are detrsructive elements, metapthyically compared to materials (dry wood) consumed by an active flame.
The Latin-like text translates into English as: "When the corrosive is in place where you've applied cauterization (presumably for a wound or injury), then briefly ignite small charcoal sticks, and apply large ones only when necessary at that location which contains the corrosion." This translation indicates an old medical practice of using heat to treat certain skin conditions locally. Here "cauterize" refers to intentionally creating burns on specific areas as a healing method for lesions possibly related to infections or wounds, and it implies targeted treatment at sites
The translation into English for this line is: "Apply cauterization where the entire breakage has occurred, completely removing all of the decay and not leaving any cause behind." This suggests an intensive treatment aimed at eradicating corrosion (degeneration or deterioration) entirely without causing additional harm to ensure full recovery. In this context,
The translated English version of this line is: "Let it act for three days, and pause over the cauterized locations until all scars are completely healed out, and no decay remains." Here physicians seem advised a specific treatment regime that involves allowing some time after applying heat or burning (cauterization) to ensure thorough eradication of both visible injuries such as scar formation ("scaras") and underlying corrosion. It implies patience in the healing process with regular checks for complete recovery, which aligns well within historical medical practices where rest is often pres

May the lancet be used where heat is applied with cautery that simulately resembles pain, which consists of a fine iron according to the amount contained in the key for entirety division, and it comprises delicate margins.
Return the flame to that joint and place your hand on the hot instrument within which the heat will penetrate deeply into the joint. Leave it there for three days while you begin taking something (likely a medication or treatment as suggested by "getar," which could be an archaic term related to starting therapy). Here comes the sentence to translate: Emplace that dampened wax on it for a night, and hopefully, this will remove those reasons from them.
Return care is given within where raw flesh has been healed.

If the sanction is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you move and extract the caustic, then take another cauterium immediately prepared in that area, so that it does not continue to do harm within the limb.
Guard against not burning the nerves here that are present and bringing healing over the abdomen or other malevolence.
When the artery is blocked and it's not possible to restore flow in those areas, especially when the artery is large, unless one of four methods are used: or apply cauterization where we have touched (apply heat), or extraction if necessary – when extremities are extracted they must be burned away and restrain blood flow; let there be chains on bones for strong compression to keep them in place within the splinting material.
May those who administer proper restriction of the patient not suffer from discomfort due to burning or swelling caused by reasons related to fire and appearance; they will only endure pain.
May it happen that no doctor or medicine is present, then work according to the indicated spot on their vein as we have here, understanding where great pain enters from beneath the patient's waist line and above the pelvic bone; this place should not be further aggravated. And over the area of concern may there be an application with strong medicinal foam that encompasses them so they become congested and swollen; perhaps in such a case, intervention or medicine is required.

And place your finger at that which makes entry into the artery; and put on gloves thereon before extracting what is within it from the ribcage where those are found beneath clothes, throughout all parts of extraction.
May it be that if the artery is subtle, you will encircle it with this thread at the extremity of the body part, and insert one portion according to the quantity by which their limbs are elongated and contracted; thus there won't be any flow of bile. Provided, however, that if not inserted properly, the bile from all will have nowhere to go.
Return the viscus (or sanct of life) within three times into its cavity and place your hand over it to prevent expulsion.
If the artery is large, then make sure you place it in two locations down to the feet and back up halfway along the bones or heartstrings, avoiding decay at this time when consolidation of fluid occurs within, which will flow outwardly from thereafter.

If while working you encounter an outflow of sick blood from the artery during labor, then immediately take measures to constrict that flow of blood, or use a tourniquet where it is applied, and tighten your grip so as not to restrict the site of contraction. If there is any cause of those not present to you now, then pause the flow over the place where it has become swolthy and inflamed within which rests its nature; let this locality relax in water with vigorous flogging until the heat subsides, at that point apply gentle pressure.
When humors are expelled from the artery, you cauterize both sites with two lances already having prepared these spots for attempt and restrain them hereby; thus lengthening what is between the limbs of your patient so that it will not be consolidated at all by this cautery.
This is how the cautery works:
E is when both coats are exemplary. May it be that if the patient'thy humors are hot and sharp as two knives in any joint of their body (suggesting severe inflammation or fever), we do not cut down into flesh swiftly.

Regarding the treatment of acute and sharp pains in limbs (Note: The translation interprets "Capitol quart" as possibly a reference to part or chapter, but with insufficient context
When sharp pains occur in those veins located under the head's forehead (which are often referred to as "Capitol quart" or frontal region), there is no underlying medical cause for their treatment; sometimes, these patients feel parched and wish they could walk like ants with ease. The wounds from such pains become inflamed, causing itching similar to fleas biting humans—indicating the severity of discomfort or distress associated with this condition as described in ancient medical texts (Note: This translation is interpretative and aims to convey concepts likely related to headaches possibly linked to venous congestion. The term "Capitol quart" suggests an area on top of the skull, often used metaphorically or historically referring to specific regions within classical times.)
You command the malady dragons that are in their own face, and appoint three gullet cracks along the mouth'diction according to its length.

And if there is an obstruction (foreign body), then use an arsenicum tube and insert its extremity into the ulcer of the aureole, sealing it with wax and oiled substance to ensure that only the tube protrudes without being obstructed. When applied pressure is placed on the lower part of the belly for too long with what we have discussed so far, excess humors are retained and accumulated therein.
If there is no opening (for the procedure), then take some lead alloy or shield armor which has pressure points where fingers touch when pinching it tightly; pause at the extremity of the ray, and cover that portion gently wrapped as taken out for treatment.

This could refer to procedures intended at correcting or mitigating blockages, potentially remedying issues with eye lubrication caused by cold humor accumulation affecting ocular function as previously mentioned. It might be related to an attempt of the medieval practitioner to restore balance and flow using manual interventions akin to lithotomy for stones – in this case targeting tears or 'humors' within tear ducts rather than kidney stones, which was also common medical practice at

Similarly, 'polyp' suggests a fleshy protrusion within the body that can form in places like the mouth and nasal passages (commonly found on surfaces such as polyps). Here "Polyp From the meat there are black dots and it is not of dark brown like normal flesh." - The line indicates that within a certain kind of nasal growth (possibly polyps), one can find distinctive, possibly malignant changes – these could be described as 'black spots' which differ in color from typical or healthy meat.

When decayed teeth are subject to grinding and loosening due to percussion or extraction, where the pulp cannot withstand what holds it (likely referring to dental instruments used in these procedures), then this has been treated by your remedies for dull abscesses. However, you haven't provided effective care; thus, they will fall into those held firmly with gold or silver nails – metals that do not change and can be adjusted daily as needed (gold being malleable whereas silver may lose its strength over time).

When the catarrh of the humidity is present in the throat and it'seither long-lasting or protracted, then its name does not follow a straight path; if instead, it occurs in large, thick pieces (which could refer to heavy mucus), that too is called gout.
When healed by the water we have spoken about in division, and it does not hinder your treatment, and furthermore now you will witness that I apply cauterization as needed and subtly; if directed thereafter to that area which is added round (likely referring to a rounded mass or growth), take care of what was previously mentioned. Moreover, when this goes long in length and has dark red/black coloration not localized centrally within the abdomen, hold onto your fear for it lies upon the abdomen; in that place you should maintain caution.
When you time that which the patient has described as their pale and long illness following your instructions, thus open up (or 'make holes') in the abdomen using a tool of its own making to fix it there for an hour or so at a stretch; then draw out this with two instruments—one each being used on one side of either molar's jawline.
When what is not inserted into it but rather adjusted to the patient'thy natural addition, if you insert anything from there at all, speak slowly and carefully.
Return (put back) into its cavity the inflammation within two thighs and care for it where healing occurs therein.
If the male was frightened by his sight and used force during cauterization due to fear, then using a tongue for this purpose is merely water from above (implying that they are not thick or subtle), hold it as we have mentioned previously. Also take up the water which has been described in the context of cauterization; firmly grasp with this instrument and fill its cavity completely. Holding these living waters, do so without causing them to be dense nor thin—completely filling their hollow form is what should happen here:
Where the exterior cavity of the body is where medicine has been applied as with a surgical knife' extraneous blood or pus will rise to that location, and through it into the mouth (presumably referring to coughing up phlegm), so nothing arises from there causing harm to his joints.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And place your hand on my mouth, and express that which is therein through the spaces of the hourglass until it becomes blackened and numb from the medicine'dictorship bites.
If you wish, cut the cord and cover it with medicine; immerse the cord in medicinal substances until enough has been absorbed to satisfy what is needed for cauterization of the wine, then apply an ointment once it dries out and falls off within three to four days.
If you are indigested and proceed with medicine, continue that practice, applying cauterization away from the body'thy base within its boundary at first place beginning therein, cleansing whatsoever fluid present in it through rinsing under water flow, treating externally with a poultice made of mustard seeds, and ensuring healing until health is restored.
This remedy is applied with caution due to fear and has been used for a very long time.
Alcunas vegetazioni are cured by water poured under which caulks and instruments inscribed with silver or metal, used in this remedy: rosemary, thyme, sage, rue, Arabic scabies, camomile, crushed plant parts for these herbs; all that is necessary to address the causes of inflammation herein present are immersed under water and bubbles form thereupon; a stone rests atop where instruments have been submerged within this bath - upon which an instrument made from artemisia, as per our practice today.
And when that part enters the mouth of the malady within which the breath rises above its point (whereby the uvula becomes obscured).
Here applies the treatment on that stagnation which has been dried up for some time within it, and take care not to perform this healing at mealtime; otherwise, you will inadvertently trigger a flare-up of the parasite infestation. Instead, wait until after eating before performing any treatment related to lice removal (head cautery).
May it not be that you do not have this instrument present? Then take a can and compose in the outer womb (the cavity outside of oneself) a closure with hemp, so that the mouth of the humidifier is moistened; for the enclosure made from hemp prevents vapor from entering there.
This treatment is good for health (salvation).

From the removal of thorns and water stuck in the foot, as well as from other causes.
Movements persistently stick or remain attached at the back of the knee or any other cause.
And when you extract the water that appears from those parts above where it is seen on the surface of the tongue with an instrument inserted into the mouth, make sure to confirm by placing your finger in such manner that whatso extruded will be declared as being within the gout (presumably referring to a condition related to excessive uric acid).
When the patient does not appear and is hidden in the stomach, where you make them vomit while their food is decomposed in the belly; or when they expel a piece of bread from inside, or a dry pea crushed with laythorn, or sea sponge dried with lion's hair – that strong thing will be faithful and lift up this malaute. Once lifted out through the place where their bones are extracted (implying an abscess), it is thereafter returned to its cavity; when once at the location of which they extract their pins, then those things come forth together with what was brought back in forcefully by faith and lifting up this malaute. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May it be that if not through this portal we have discussed the causes previously mentioned, then use a lead tool in this manner.
Even if a large stone enters where there is no opening in the body cavity, which you introduce into the patient'thy bowels for easy passage.
And lift the patient'thy head upwards, and make sure that you guard where your touch is on their throat or backbone, so as to bring cos into them who are lodged in the mouth or spine; this it is what the doctor has appointed for himself/herself.
Indeed, when the malady enters and knows its cause near at hand as well as insists on being attended to herewith, it pulls back his tool according to how much he has prepared within this threshold of readiness.
Given that "Capitol" is not directly translatable due to
The provided text appears to be in a Romance language mixture, which could include elements of Latin grammar and vocabuls from Italian ("golero" resembles "calderone",
When bloodletting is used in the division of medical treatment and does not cause discomfort within the abdomen (believed to be part of "le guolayro del malaute"), consider that you have come into possession of this instrument for drawing out which, as recommended herein.
Thus, if you find a swelling, remove it either slightly or finely by careful descent.
If it is not possible to extract therefrom, then take a concave cannula and insert that into the marrow of the joint, placing a heated iron pin in the concavity of the cannula, applying as much heat (so long as the pus within the joint has died and stopped draining), until it is removed for the day.
Here comes the translation of each line:
If there is no remedy found in the water that we have recommended for fumes, then let them cleanse (or purify) their malady either through a clyster or by aconite based on what has been suggested during steam cleansing with this instrument.
When it is necessary (E si es necesitat), points need to be made upon the surface of the foot (lahoras
And when it is necessary (E si es necesitat) to operate in smelting the humors within that space, you take hold of an oiled vessel containing combustible materials and cover it with a lid which has a hole for insertion—this serves as your instrument. You then remove this from underne07 below-the-smelter area; concurrently, raise the malady's mouth to its tip using the end of the cannula (instrument), while clasping one's own mouth over that part to ensure that sublimation—removal and purification process inside the smelting vessel—does not occur until you are certain it has reached completion, at which point the malady is said to have been cured.
If not cured, then repeat the subfumigation movements, and prevent the malady from drinking, eat salted meats and alcoholic beverthyrs, do not smoke or drink water when it is necessary that this regimen must be maintained.
This is the form of the tool with which bloodletting (suuguation) from the gallbladder is performed when viewed; it resembles forceps but has no bend in it. The given medieval medical treatise text translates to English line by line as follows:
Capitol XL. (The given text does not provide content
In the fragment provided, it appears to be a line from what seems like an ancient or medieval medical treatise written in a language with Latin influences—the sentence is not completely clear due to potential transcription issues or archaic vocabul
The pegs are specialized and moved manually, as remembered in this textbook (from which the sentence is taken). The reference to "motas" suggests a manual manipulation or adjustment of some form—likely medical devices used for treatment during that historical period. In English: Pegs move by hand-guided motion as they are recalled from their use herein described
They differ in their drilling and assembly methods for themselves—one of these is specifically designed as pegs within them, into which they are inserted with manual manipulation (implied by "manieyras"). Therefore, because this refers to the insertion process involving humidity: They necessitate moisture from the body during their application. The sentence translates English and reflects a time when medical practices required direct physical effort for inserting peg-like devices into parts of the human anatomy—likely as part of dressings or splinting procedures
The second manipulation involves the locations where injections occur within the body, with pegs inserted into different areas—one being distinct from those typically occurring at the head (noted as "accidente en le cap"), another separate for accidental instances likewise present but located elsewhere. Each type of insertion is performed through surgical operation(s). The English translation indicates a highly skilled medical procedure where peg-like instruments were inserted into various body sites, with specific types designated according to the site and purpose within therapeutic or treatment context—highlighting an era when medicine required precision tools operated by professionals. This sentence underscubes both historical surgical complexity as well as specialization in medical interventions aimed at addressing different bodily regions through distinct techniques, likely for
May some of these be puncture wounds that have not been pierced but are appropriate for the disease in those parts or adjuncts to their illnesses.
So others are inserted when they are thrown and not matured according to their role, just like those that belong to joints; as soon as one is placed at a juncture, it exists within the pockets of water circulating in its circuit, damaging the ligaments or nerves of that joint. If such an insertion occurs into the main member before maturation, perforation will happen there too; if not yet inserted and you decide to perform the operation then, piercing won't lead to indigestion but rather what is related to the abdomen—the foreskin or anal area. If penetrated here without completing digestion (i.dict in this context), it will protrude at the body parts of that region and cause a fistula, which won't heal there either. When you know the right time for performing surgery on the insertion (presumably an abscess or other medical issue requiring drainage), then that is when it has matured and becomes ready to be treated medically.
Here you understand that the pain and fever are subsiding, and as such reduce both talking (rogar) and heart rate (pulsacio), along with the inflammation of the head post-abscess (apostema). Also note improvements in other symptoms.
When you know where the abscess entry is in this area, and coming up from treatment of swelling headaches, then:
Perforation occurs through the length of the body or limb, if spider bites are in muscle parts or feet areas and on joints where ligaments meet tendons; finally, it affects all awkward places where reflection does not occur naturally; these apply to locations that reflect. In this sentence:
When the abscess is in the flesh, then we let the puncture of it inside until its digestion for a second confirmation has been completed; however, if you pierce that area now, it will extend both the thigh and hips' joints and harden their lips and depth.
May one insert an augur through the necessity dictated by the condition of the body or according to what is needed for that member which craves it.
When you administer a small puncture, and for large or wide incisions as dictated by the size of the instruments, proceed accordingly.
Other interventions at the locations where the colon has been lacerated and dilated, when it aches as bread or becomes inflamed like a bladder full of pus, with that which you have previously caused to worsen in bursts of feverishness.

From them in which it is administered, a round and moon-shaped piece, resembling those to whom they are given:
May it be not possible for him to bear with surface lion' extrusions; if you pierce that which has already been punctured on the surface or flatly so much.
When the abscess is large and has collected pus, do not attempt to extract it all at once; take out some from that spot today, place what was extracted inside another part today, remove a larger portion tomorrow, and continue removing smaller amounts as directed until fully drained. (This line combines elements of multiple languages due to the ancient style.)
Mostly if the malady is from froth venom or a female prenatal stage, or of small childhood, for when the animal spirit moves within and exits sickness, it can be resolved by intervention at that moment; then perform surgery on them.
1. Guard it with great care, and place your tool in the hole where you pierce these warts, so as to avoid catching diseases; consider if the wart's flesh is thin or flat, then administer whatsoimoves him or from ancient remedies accordingly; but if the wart is large, and there are fissures within your puncture hole, let us pause here in any part of our encounter.
If an abscess has separated a part of the tongue or that area has been concave in the circuit, then take care to cover it with fine cloth or linen as you have done when carrying pans and sharp objects; keep its moisture until the third day, and apply those treatments within which the ointment inside will heal.
If you harden the flow of bile during your operation, then apply cold water and compress these places where the thick fluid flows regularly, placing it over that area to control the movement of the thickened bile flow.
May if the flow of blood continues, then take care that you follow your regimen and medicines as recommended in these sections of our book and division.
If it is winter time and the ulcer location is where nerves are weakened, then cover them with crumbs of vine leaves and oil to stop bleeding at those places.
If it is summer and the parts are meaty, then when you pause pulpils at the beginning in water and oil (and vinegar), as we have mentioned before, do so for that day which will be freshly cleansed by these means; furthermore, cover up the ulceration and cleanse away any moisture from it to aid in its healing.

In the context of a medieval medical treatise, this line refers to parasitic worms that enter through the navel (belly button). Here's an English translation
Here we have parasitic worms entering the navel of a person; these creatures contain their bodies, and they are their sources or means to continue existence - essentially referring that people get infected when such types (of said navigal/belly button) enter. It's noteworthy how medieval texts often depicted disease with almost supernatural explanations wherein physical elements of daily life were believed to be the source of illness
Thus they are wet and contain moisture like lemon juice - likely referring that these parasites thrive in damp or moist conditions similar to the citrus's high water content, as is often noted with lemons (the fruit). The imp And those contain moisture similar to puls (blood), and assembled with them; also of those which are stone-like hard - suggesting that some parasites may resemble blood in consistency or perhaps be embedded within it due to their firm nature, as if they were stones lodged there. This could indicate a detailed observation by the medieval practitioner regarding various properties and appearances of different types of these worms infesting
In the entirety and in extracting those worms there is not fear; for when you remove them nothing opposes iron (probably referring to medical instruments made of metal). This implies that despite potential discomfort or trepidation associated with finding parasitic infestations, their removal using tools like surgical irons would occur without resistance from the worms themselves. The medieval practitioner re

If there is an increase in moisture, then divide that segment into its corresponding deep and surface segments according to this manner.

The given line appears nonsensical as it resembles Roman numerals rather than
This phrase in Latin translates to "the portion of the skrooia that was acidified in the colon" in English. Here is a line-by-line translation:
This translates to: "These movements occur in the colon and intestines, as well as within other parts of the body; some even acidify (or inflame) into these areas." This sentence appears to describe a process that can happen with conditions affecting various regions such as colitis or appendicitis where localized discomforts might arise due to inflammation. If this context is medical, it would be important for the patient's healthcare provider (medico)
This translation into English would be: "Those that acidify in the colon and those movements born within them; all of this scrofulous disease adheres to its own tunic (skin), like nodes and swellings on our head, as we have treated." Here it seems a medical practitioner is discussing how scrofulosis—a skin condition associated with chronic exposure or infection involving the colon mentioned earlier—manifests itself. The treatment approach they are referring to might involve managing symptoms similar to those seen on nodules and swellings of the head, possibly suggesting an interdisdonary similarity between cutaneous manifestations (skin) and systematic health issues such as inflammation
The line translates to English as: "These scrofulous nodules are movements; some of them solid like stone fragments within (possibly in the lesions), others contain moisture, and those malignant ones which have not been cured." Here a medical professional might be classifying different types or stages of skin conditions related to 'scrophulae,' possibly referring to granulomas that are part of an inflammatory response. It appears they differentiate between benign (non-malign) and malignant nodules, with the latter requiring further clinical attention
So when you have good disposition in the treatment (which color is proper to the penis and moist throughout the body without affecting nerves, veins, or arteries), then insert that superficial part of the area between the thighs above the knee joint line into this range marked by .G. below the iliac crest line; observe it all over (if you need these for some reason) and extract them little by little as in our apostles, which is:
And there may be caution that a vein or nerve is not entrapped.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When the sanction has separated (or detached).
Then return to your operation within which you have completed it.
When inquiry is necessary about any other small skin diseases indicated herein, then investigate those and clean them out.
If it is in the state of severe scrofulosis and not inserted that scrofulus into its cavity, then do so accordingly. Based on my understanding of Latin-influenced Romance languages and medical terminology, here's an attempt at translation:
When you complete filling the wound with thick Egyptian ointment that you have already immersed in it, take care of it properly.
If you find that the swelling is complete, then adjust your fingers and cheeks to place them just enough so that there'thy not any excessive inflammation left over.
Mayhaps if you find there is an overflow beyond the grandeur of the swelling due to the scrofulus (a type of skin lesion or abscess), understand its root cause, and accordingly apply treatment as directed.
And that which contains moisture within it, penetrates the surface here at your place of growth and healing, and also stops any overflow from what you have placed below its base, as we have mentioned before.
And apply an injection of wax and ointment to these areas, so that the decay caused by it can be removed from the body'thy substance. When you bathe the patient'thy flesh is being cleansed inside where healing ointment has been introduced for its cure to take effect.

So when we want to collect the fluid (presumably synovial or other body fluids), insert the catheter nowhere near three circles within each circle of the catheter, but rather a small section along that line between two circles for how much quantity it should be collected – ensuring this portion is in cartilage and not bone. Here, carrion (decaying flesh) or soft tissue from your patient are used as suction materials.

Discussed here is what Albucasis suggests—that the spoken word we have toiled over merely serves as an exposé of already opened vessels in which the malady has ascended upwards into the thoracic cavity (the chest), and then sunk within, while also causing dryness inside them. The flesh from that region now stands exposed between us; it is threatened with death because its lifeblood circulation halts therein as a consequence of being detached or separated in such manner by the disease ('apostasma'). As for these vessels—the arteries and veins (alcus) inside this area, after they have ceased their flow due to illness' effects, now risk entrenching themselves further into that flesh. This blockage prevents any respiration from occurrs within those affected areas of the body by cutting off oxygen supply ('respire le malaute sobre le loc'). However, Albucasis then proceeds with a proposition for saving life: By situating salts (sal) in or on these exposed vessels—thereby creating an opening allowing some breath to enter and revitalize those lifeless spaces within the body.
For the commandment of water to wash out what has been unleashed within due to wickedness (the illness), and this mischief persists for three days; therefore, at that time we order such cleaning, so as to heal what is inside.
When you have seen through me (the doctor), a servant presents the couch and mattress for their bedroom chamber, and herein they apply some part of the lungs' cane, calling it healing, thus treating them as if choking from moisture, uncovering worms inside, then trapping those same tiny worms with what was found.

Here the situation involves not only anal fissures but also possible additional vascular problems requiring attention due to their potential complications; varices (enlarged veins) and changes resembling those of compromised blood flow might indicate more complex underlying issues such as chronic venous insufficiency, which can lead Instead of assuming that the condition will be managed with just surgery—it's as if there is less confidence or certainty in simply using medical intervention without considering other factors; perhaps conservative treatments such as lifestyle changes, medications Here comes the first source sentence to translate:

The provided text appears to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise
Regarding care for the navel (umbilicus).
Eminence of the navel is pain caused by movements or fissures in the cistern that are above the abdomen; holding it with a cloth or bubble as needed for other ruptures; or due to constipation, which flows from veins or arteries (as stated), or due to constricted expansion within.
If there is a crack in the cistern and leakage from the cloth (which could refer to an injury or rupture of some sort), then the appearance of the bruise resembles that of the body; it hurts like a lion, and appears differently depending on different situations. If it is for the escape of the hernia, then when you have noted that which has come out today and its strong variety may differ each day, make sure to return it; immediately afterward, immerse him in baths with vigorous exercise.
If it is due to moisture, then the dragon (referring likely to an inflammation or swelling) will not be hidden by your hand when you press upon it; nor will it be tightened up and squeezed shut with forceful pressure from yours.
If it is for sanction, then you will see signs of black decay descending upon these limbs.
May it be due to flesh nothing severe, rough and hard; then is set for a certain quantity.
May it be due to wind activity, then handling of him is like a lion.
And if the eminence of the navel is due to a splinter or vein, consider that which should be forbidden in its treatment; for it instills fear and anxiety as taught in the capital where I have previously mentioned treatments with arsenic and venesection.
If the prominency of the navel is due to either the belly or the skin, order that it swells with its own fluid and remains extended; also assign a guard at each part where you have touched for protection over them on top of their position beneath your hands, and surround the entire circumference of this area as well around the space occupied by spinal cord within the navel's circuit. Additionally appoint control to be present between these two large kidneys; furthermore assign it location throughout its course in said region surrounding where touch was made for protection above their position beneath your hands, and extend tendon or ligament along this pathway as far outwards as possible towards hernia-prone areas.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: Ensure that you insert your finger undernethy's applied heat stretch over the ligaments and place it there, both in this way and by pushing if they have retracted or are guarded through those same tendons; but should these recede further away from their position due to said application of force on them via the ligaments, then you must pull back and push the intestine into its respective abdominal parts.
If you have torn the fabric (possibly referring to a bandage or dressing), then take that one and remove its excess parts from it.
If it is contrary to your arsenic or vein, surround that area, and return to your operation; take two needles and insert them into those fields you have opened beyond the inflamed joint in a manner of penetration—perform this around the affected areas on the needles. Then firmly bind the swelling at four parts with respect to these inserted needles.
If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them where it pierces the extended flesh and enters itself; when done subtly, care for that which comes out of the linens inside which is being cured.
If the swelling of the navel is from meatlessness or moisture in it, then you must cover it with what has been given and extracted to dry up this wetness, which resides therein, and take care that whatever covers will absorb such fluids and secure the place.

We already have preparations made in division within the waters of artemisia (an herb), and with each essence extracted from that plant for healing purposes related to liver health—a common theme during medieval times when understanding was linked more closely to home remedies than modern medicine. This line suggests a holistic approach, where water-derived substances are combined in some form of medicinal preparation aiming at treating issues associated with the liver or its functions (indicated
This statement further elucses that it is not the solely Althi (an herb) alone for treating jaundice—what may be interpreted as liver-related discoloration or malfunction in medieval language understanding—nor does it approach Timpanistres nor Yposarcha, which could refer to other substances. Importantly mentioned is that this particular treatment with Althi can lead directly to mortality ('mortal'), indicating caution and perhaps a recognition of the severe nature of liver diseases at times before modern medicine provided more effective treat
When you have already administered this artemisia-related medication and it is not providing relief for the current ailment—whether it be jaundice or another condition related to malady/disease (as per medieval medical understanding)—consider that perhaps remedy has achieved detoxification, just as if you were addressing troubles throughout your body's systems and humors. Importantly noted is the concern about not applying further treatment with this specific herb unless there are signs of discomfort or ailment elsewhere in one’s physical self—head to toe (body-wide). The undercurrent here emphasizes prudence, suggesting that without clear indication from symptoms beyond liver issues addressed by the artemisia remedy, further application could prove dangerous.
May if you once again inflate the abdomen excessively and it is not another illness but simply water carried there by itself alone; neither youth nor old age are concerned here.

Through which I will pierce the cyst inside so that the stone may reach its place of water (the uric acid crystal in a joint). The location where this occurs is within or near the body'thy fluid space. Return that out of its place and insert an instrument of which this is the form: and it seems like a silver thin tube under your body, made of either silver or ivory with a small puncture at the lower part; there are three pricks on each limb – two from one side and one from another - and its pointed end is sharp according to the quill pen's tip: as times go by.
When in the outer chamber of him there is an instrument placed, when it enters the water, that will immediately rise above the tool, so much as evacuates from the hourly quantity; if he withdraws more than what comes out during this time, his humors resolve themselves due to their natural course or death arrives via five cauteries which are deemed appropriate for such an end.

When children have bladder issues where the voiding of urine has not been properly perforated or formed, it is a condition that requires medical attention for proper care and treatment:
Some times children get sick from their mother'se womb, and the head of their mixture is not pierced (or it falls apart or remains in its place).
So then a hole is drilled into it just enough that it enters under the skin gently, according to this method.
And in the abdomen place a small hammer made of lead and wire on it, holding for three days or four (three times three is seven).
When one needs to urinate or defecate (urine and stool), return it as directed.
If you do not pause the stone, it is possible that the urine will flow over this area and wet it down here.
May that which causes strain be treated with iron as we have said, within a few days for it to become amplified.

The provided text appears to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise
The text in question seems to describe a medical condition, likely related to the penis (as suggested by "prepuci" which is Latin for circumcision or foreskin). The description might be referring to an inflammation caused by acidity ("accideys en le prepucii"), corruption ("corropcio"), and blackness/negritude along with adherence of the skin near the tip (or "cap")
The sentence describes an ongoing issue where there is likely inflammation and possibly a swollen foreskin ("albater"), particularly at the base or "verga" (which typically refers to this area in medical Latin terms). The term could indicate that both redness/
The sentence distinguishes between a harmful condition and one not considered as such (which can be interpreted to mean benign versus potentially cancerous or otherwise dangerous). This distinction is crucial in diagnosing
This sentence describes steps for addressing the non-malignant issue: carefully remove small pieces (possibly of skin or foreign material causing irritation), and afterward ensure that these are placed under a fine cloth, preferably Egyptian linen known at the time as "engua." Following this procedure allows healing from within with an ointment—presumably one made in Greece referred to here. The terms reflect practices of wound care or treatment common during medieval times:
If the gallbladthy is dark in hue and harmful, then apply your caustics to its liver area and belly region.
If the foreskin is present on the head of the penis, and one part has been cut (circumcision), while another remains intact, as long as you hold it during insertion to ensure consolidation; and furthermore when curing that remaining skin after inserting the penis, there's no certainty it won’thy not tear.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return that treatment here is for its own cure once it has been administered internally and externally, ensuring overall healing. (Here I've translated the sentence by understanding medieval medical concepts into
If there is a flow of blood involved, then administer luna-based (presumably referring to some form of treatment involving the moon) in this manner. (This translation assumes that "lunar" refers to something related to or influenced by the phases of the moon
Two instruments for young healers are here: one is related to blood flow and the other concerns broken bones when they get out of place (or "corrumputed"). Here I've translated it into modern English, interpreting that this treatise likely discusses two medical tools or techniques—one possibly a form of cupping therapy for circulation issues
If the cap of a cupping tool is broken and destroyed within an hour, insert your finger into the penis's foreskin to allow semen (or "malign") to flow out through that opening you have made with wood—this could be referring to manual stimulation or natural ejaculation as part of treatment. This interpretation assumes a context where some form of bodily fluids are seen as therapeutic, which was not uncommon in historical medical practices.
In the practice of circumcision, where adherence is not done with acid but rather through a sharp tool (the penis strap or foreskin snare), and it's not exerted around in any way; when corrosion occurs due to dirtiness or an abscess formation—use thorny spines inside which the ligament has dissolved completely, allowing complete removal of the remaining part (or 'fore-head') of the foreskin. Here I've translated it into modern English while attempting to capture medieval medical jargon and understanding:
If it is difficult to reach those exquisitely, then cover your hand with spine bone or some sharp stone and apply pressure on the head of the thorn and penis area gently until you pierce through due to its subtlety during enlightened touch.

The text provided appears to be from an ancient medical treatise discussing methods for diagnosing
In the process of bringing up children and caring for those who have undergone circumcision.
Circumcision is not cure for diarrhea along with other diseases: but if it comes from our operation and effort, and in children specifically, we must assign them to the better treatment course immediately so they can recover quickly.
So it is said that ancient people did not perform circumcision on free days, nor do they use them for their laws, and only have them because of experiments, which causes the loss of a significant part of artisans and barbarians to practice circumcision and mundification with new instruments made from leather and bone; using sinew from tendons and skin.
E you have already tried all these methods and found no better improvement with thread or needle in the unguent as used on the skin, where motes escape below knee joints (the patella), between prepuces of two tunics (double linen garments worn undernethy clothes), downwards rapidly along the thigh's surface into another place and cause further pain. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And it is a washing that causes this phenomenon for alphec (phlegm), and of which they use their fingers ('digital'), not being secured inside the extremity of the male member, but rather entering into his body cavity.
May happen during surgery with iron and corrupt your operation. The child' extrinsic nature is short and prone to movements that do not require polishing (or refinement), as has been observed by him/her.
May the cutting that is done with forks and needles be strong health (well-be01), which I have experimented myself; as such are the incisions proportionate according to understanding, so also does their sharpness correspond to what has been cut away previously—this ensures precision. Thus when you determine your two acutenesses appropriately for measurement and proceed with cutting following a single action within an interval of time, it results in compression of the affected area shaped like the heel stopper holding all parts without error (no mistakes occurring).
The first sentence translates to: The primary reason for the operation is that you must ensure the child stays mostly in its bracelet only as long as necessary and let it go back into other activities on another day.
And for that particular joy in all of this matter, which is within your grasp because you receive its intelligence, do so accordingly: Prepare that state between your thighs so it is not gross or excessive; and hide the tools in your hand or under your chest, so that the child does not see them at all.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Place your hand inside their waist and blow into their throat so that it inflates therein; then grasp whatsoidergrows from there, cleaning whatever is accumulated in her secretions.
The form of knives used in surgery is thus:
Here come the limbs not-thrown and others are like axes that don't pierce through to the bone joints, and their lengths match those of two handles used in hand therapy tools.
May errors in comprehension be few and far between, or entirely within yourself; then you must seek understanding inside of yourself.
So, when you spread it over your finger' extramedical area and insert that second to its proper size.
If you cannot hold it with your tongue, then extract that which is in the joint and incise that part.
If it has been three days, and when the poultice applied to the area with an aspirated wart is infused for some time, then apply water into that space until the aspirated wart recedes easily, clean off any fluidity present therein, and afterwards what you have prepared.
Guarding your head of the wax (which implies keeping it safe and covered), for not letting water enter onto him/her.
So care for that which water has solidified from the dusts, within the channels of those particles.
If it is inserted into the navel according to measure, and one observes its parts below, none will notice it therein.

In the context of a discussion about retained urine within the bladder, here is a possible translation into English:
Retain urine in the bladder as it may be caused by excess humors due to stone or sancus contraction, or from fleshiness or fatteness, and seem similar to those mentioned for curative measures of this disease division.
If it is not soluble in water that we have mentioned as the cause of pain on the abdomen (belly), then cover its removal with a tool they call the syringe through which this form takes: It may be made of silver and subtle lion, small like an instrument used for catheterization having long sharpness similar to that found in both hand palm and middle finger.
The following text is translated line by line into English:
And apply the malady upon the foot, and bind up the bladder of him with oil and waxes; using olive oil and beeswax.
Return the catheter into its ease of entry where it reaches the port of the urethra; and bend the urethra below the pubic division; push the catheter down that way until it arrives at the bladder, ensuring that the urine is drained out from there without forcing according to this order.
Whenever you extend the iron slowly with wool thread by little and bit until it reaches where the urine takes its place in the wool (i.e., when urea has penetrated into the fabric), that is a clear sign of excess
Whenever you extract the impure substance (urine), and continue to do so with a cloth until it is fully expelled from both bladder and thighs, this action relieves constipation of obstructed bowels caused by urinary blockage due to accumulated waste products.

Regarding the quality and condition of catheterization for draining urine, whereby such instruments are specifically arranged to be in accordance with water's properties (possibly implying a sterile or clean technique).

Whenever there is an ulceration or abscess in the bladder, or when coitus (sexual intercourse) has occurred at that point, and urine must be drawn out from it using a specific instrument—that procedure represents this action. Here "instrument" likely refers to something used during catheterization such as specially designed collection bags for draining fluids or other medical tools required in the management of bladder conditions involving trauma, sexual intercourse (which could be interpreted metaphorically), and inflammation—implying a need for careful clinical attention. The text suggests that removing fluid ("drawing out urine") from these compromised areas is done with particular care or equipment designed specifically for such circumstances in the medieval medical practice context, where modern cath

Here you attach that to the tool and apply it there as well where you have applied your touch previously in the bladder; I express this so that moisture may reach the bladder.

From stone extraction, this translates roughly into English as extracting or removing something from a rock
From stone extraction, we now discuss the spices of rock and their curative properties in medicine; distinguishing between those formed by rivers (fluvial) and those from within bladders/urine pockets ("vesica"), as well as what makes them different. This translation interprets a complex medical text related to mineralogy, its extraction methods, classifications based on their origins—whether fluvial or formational due to urinary systems (indicated by "vesica")—and the unique properties these stones might possess that could be relevant in ancient medicinal practices.

So it's said that the stone formed in the bladder mainly affects children; and from its urine which is like water (in subtlety) appears, showing there—and on those shores; as mucus flows within their bodies, with periodic bubbling motions similar to foam or froth. It's dressed accordingly at that time of year when the forum becomes a place where these appear; and here they are taken away in bunches (possibly referring to treatment collection). This translation interprets an ancient medical text discussing pediatric urolithiasis—the formation of stones within children’s urinary systems. The original author emphasizes that such conditions typically manifest distinctly, with specific symptoms like the mucus-like appearance and bubbling motions in expelled stone material (uremia). It also mentions seasonal variations affecting treatment approaches or removal strategies for these stones ("foro le cul" might refer to a place where patients are collected during certain times of year, potentially indicating localized medical practices based on the time.

So when we reach the treatment of that, cover it with a medicament (likely some formulation) taken from those leaves which extract out all the stones from where they are lodged within your joints; this fissure allowed only few times prohibits extraction by force and requires investigation.

Returning into its cavity is how this occurs: And divide in it what is between the knee and thighs, not on its place but from the left hip socket; above that stone it forms a transverse section, so that this layer can be wide and cut according to the amount of the stone therein presentable at once without exceeding, for which reason if necessary compound what is in the abdomen where the stone lies.
Be aware that there is no stone from which the limb bends and angles at its joints; thus treatment herein becomes difficult due to lack of resources (water or other necessary humors).
From that fluid it seems like a lion and is round, made of the patient'supurations (impure humors), treatment or purification process hereby performed by us:
So if it is that which you are addressing with your fingers and thumbs, adjust in the crack/split.
If there is not a hole for the cure (medicine), then make sure to work on that area carefully, or where you have applied force and caused pain which remains with the lime used for treatment; do not avoid it as such – promptly insert a delicate instrument of curvature.
If you cannot place your hand on it, then magnify the defect a little and if there is effusion of blood, remove that which has been tripled with sulphur (vinegar).
May if the stone is within one, then you will draw water to its mouth on the bladder and apply pressure over it; also drape another cloth herein; so they seem as though are stones of disease.
If there is much pain, it' extricates ignorance that you have placed deep within the abdomen; for one of two causes may afflict: either he lingers in his dysuria due to continuous urine distillation, or because not all areas are fully consolidated.
May apply the removal of it within which it has come out or in a bone break inside where extracting will take place, that is to say, when something exits from its proper location and enters another area such as fractures deep within the body, doctors may need tools like forceps for extraction.
So when you have completed your treatment, then fill the womb of our bodies with the juice of Aloe and dragon'thy blood, and strengthen it. On that cloth which is steeped in oil and vinegar or water infused with herbs, to ensure the application of caustic safely releases it.
Return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and do not let it slip inside overnight.
When that air escapes, apply water and oil to the affected area with care so that it is healed within this timeframe.
May if you cauterize an abscess that is soft and decaying, similar to the patient's bladder being frozen solidly within it (and urine cannot pass through this state), then insert a tube into the wound and remove that stone, which if left will cause further deterioration of both the bladder inside itself and in its surrounding area.

In those hours of total healing where you have both thighs and adjust the resting remedies applied at this location.
If the stone is small and located in the liver's flesh, and it lies therein, urine extraction is prohibited; otherwise healing that comes through this treatment has already reached a stage where excessively thin streams have been accused of constipation passing by this cure. And now you possess water (which should be used for medical purposes), so grasp the iron-tipped forceps provided here, which represents its form:
From beyond the mattress, gout is found in a stick.
Return it close (the wound), and place your hand on that stone just as quickly before the bladder returns to its position.
Return the iron in the spearhead into that stone wherein it enters easily by means of the penetrator'thy insertion point. Revolve the cautery in your hand slowly over that small stone, and insert it into where you made another puncture to let bodily fluid flow out; once this is done, the urine will be expelled immediately.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return your hand over what is being broken off from the bone fracture away from the wound site; it's a joint that has been dislocated and there are signs of urine leakage, thus the humors have healed.
If this cure is not within your means for any reason that prevents you from doing so, then take a piece of wax quickly and apply it on the skin, and another piece under the skin (on their body). When you apply pressure over the stone in that groove between bones, Return that out (or remove it).

No need for further bandaging the stone in the bladder; instead ensure it does not return to its place and another ligament below is used unless after separating that specific strap from around the kidney, then this suture returns to where you placed it (possibly holding down or securing tissue). Here's a translation: There is no need for additional bandaging of the stone in the bladder; instead ensure it does not return. Another ligament below should be used unless after separating that specific strap from around the kidney, then this suture returns to its original position (likely holding down or securing surrounding tissue).

It also indicates apprehension about the procedure taking place—possibly related to medical treatment of hirsutism where such interventions are carried out with consideration
If it is necessary for you to bring forth water (or any treatment fluid), then take hold of a female healing servant'dict or midwife and apply with little force.
If you lack herbal medicine or potion for women'thy health made here in the field of gynecology, seek out a skilled midwife present at this place who is knowledgeable about these parts.
Thus handle the present matter and command it to hold all that you have ordered, from inquiry about the stone until consumption at the mouth; which causes concern if the woman is pregnant, so check whether she wants to place her hand in her belly or not.
Thus if one crushes that part, and commands it quickly back into place, thus shall they order the patient to insert into that very same spot.
May it not be the veil (referring to a woman or midwife), then commands that her duty enter into the cavity of the pregnant belly and place her left hand on the bladder, keeping still until she acquires good comprehension/understanding.

Return care for the wound or injury with proper treatment (or healing). Here'
So when the sharpness of pain diminishes over time, and its location returns to normalcy (the body), then you should return to your work within which limits the wound from being aggrave again. Here 'sharpness' refers metaphorically to acute or severe symptoms that have lessened ('diminishes').

There are several measures taken in the pancreas where nature prepares it for release within its own parting (intrinsic processes), especially at a time when another is secreted; and here we have what was previously mentioned about hernias, located between white cloths around which there's already been mention of fluid from intestines. This suggests that the pancreas has an inherent role in managing digestive enzymes (like those involved with breaking down food), potentially providing insight into ancient understandings of organ function and pathology within a gastroenterological context—this line hints at self-regulating mechanisms by which bodily fluids are managed, possibly addressing issues like

When you wish to learn about the color of humidity, then seek out its moisture in the swelling that precedes it; and as soon as this is present within the wound'thy touching on, extract therefrom the same type of moisture which thou has introduced.
Then when we come to the care of him who is affected by it (the illness), let them consume what can be beneficial for the malady if possible; and at times apply pressure on his chest.
And so he rests on his two sides for any cause or few, and promptly folds the linen sheets.

May it happen if the instruments of that wound from your coda in its cavity arrive during the time of your operation, when you have completed the section of suturing the penis's tailbone, return those tools there and adjust the lips of these genitalia fissures with caution as they are being sewn together, ensuring that it heals.
If you have crushed the body due to another illness, then cover those wounds with materials that are causing bleeding and remove the humors, taking care of what we mentioned earlier.
May it be said that if water is added to any parts of the body, these are hernias; therefore you should incise this part as has been done in another location on the abdomen; and if it appears an operation must be performed thereon, perform it then.
Return the sinew and have it enter into water-soaked wool or oil cloths, submerge what you've soaked in wine and oil; spread that over two belt loops of your pants and waistband (the 'mirac del ventre'), pause with folded towels and pullovers above them, using the same thread as follows:
And take two dry sheets and woolen bindings following this manner; they are for the limbs on which one must walk or move with damp wool (i.e., to prevent injury from friction), arranged along the waistband of their pants, where each extremity's frayed edge enters at the front and back respectively, as well as two additional edges over both hip bags and shoulder straps, ensuring all is properly adjusted in the waistband of the trousers.
Some treatments for this hernia are applied artificially with caulters in the place of a hole made from iron; and you hold delicate caulters inserted under the belly button line, where hidden is the white disc containing water.

Beware that this operation is saving and prolonging blood flow, better than an incision.
May you encounter counteraction of corrosion when cutting or during bleeding measures; if such opposition occurs in your treatment as it did for the case previously mentioned hereinabove explained at that time/occasion, attend to this accordingly./Translation:
If the abdomen is painful and you do not hope for a second operation due to its horror, perform an incision according as thou hast been recommended by water; when thou art certain of what has been said about its significance, then it becomes clear that this hernia is spongy.
When you make an incision in the spleen above any raised node on the lower abdomen around the lumbar spine and stop cutting according to how far it goes,
When I have opened wide for all of it flows like water through there.
Return your hand over the location where it touches and hold that area as well to prevent the humid from running down his body. Return that which is inside so it can be healed.
May there be an imbalance of water in that hour when you pierce through it: at this time the white parting on the patient'thy skin causes opposition and prevents treatment with water, which is extracted using tools associated with such extraction; or adjust a small object within the wound.
Be aware that water returns and is collected over several months or until those accumulations are drained; when it's gathered, according to the physician' extrusion technique, gout will have passed its days within them.

Some movements have pushed out the intestine (the bowel), and this is called an enteric protrusion or intestinal hernia here.
Some movements are painful and some run through the forked intestine that is opened here, where there is a great deficiency of bile from the liver, causing severe and increasing pain when pressure is applied.

The phrase translates to: "In males the scrotum is softened by resting for about four hours between those bones that are therein (or within), and it'dicts watchfulness." This sentence suggests a medieval practice of letting men relax in specific positions, allowing time for certain anatomical structures—possibly related to fertility or the health of sperm production sites like testicles—to soften. The reference could be associated with treatments aimed at enhancing reproductive capabilities by
The phrase translates as: "Therefore necessary attention is directed towards the treatment of that which forms urine in his body according to its own, and by enclosing entirely within itself (the scrotum) where it has been softened upon; additionally adjust your lips with suture." This line implies a medical practice from medieval times involving not just observation but also potential surgical intervention—likely an operation on the urethra or surrounding structures. The mention of labial suturing suggests that this procedure might involve repairing tissues around sexual organs, possibly for conditions like epispadias or related to fertility issues in men where scrotal position and health were deemed significant by medical practitioners at the time
The phrase translates as: "If you wish to understand excess of the softened scrotum (perhaps referring to swelling), it has been cooked three or four times, and a firm suture is made." Here we see an indication that they may have had some understanding of fluid accumulation leading to edema in males. The use of repeated "cozura" implies heating

Translating this line, we have: "As midwives instruct the childless wombs to take medicine as their second nature.
It is necessary for the matron to smell the woman'se natural figure at meals through her breath and when she expresses odors in parts afterward; it happens because of what above on her body, and hurrying up with the childbirth process once this occurs. You understand that this part represents a second natural form, which is labor about one's head (the crown), wherein the second figure suspends or hangs from the navel belly button.
So when you lift those limbs, ensure that the patient's belly is compressed for them to prevent premature labor which will occur as soon as they sit on their head; at this time, give them the second pillion and remove any superfluous things from above using proper purgation.
May that which is not natural and unbearable happen to you on your feet and above your head; when it happens here too, there's a pain in the chest or atop of one’s chest, where they stand alone with no hand holding them up. Whenever this occurs—when such an unusual and intolerable thing transpires upon their soles (feet) and above their heads (cranium), manifesting as discomfort in the heart or atop of one's chest, where they stand without support from hands—it is indicative that it cannot be natural nor endurable. In such cases:

This line in English would be translated as follows: "It is a fistula or abscess." Here
This line in English would be translated as follows: "When that ancient congestion is directed by moist sticky white or subtle purulent exudates, and some of these abscesses have perforated." Here this text appears to describe a medical situation relevant during medieval times. The writer talthy conditions related with joint pains caused due to the infiltration of cold humors affecting each body part including feet (gout). Certain treatments such as making points on foot
This line in English would be translated as follows: "These penetrating ones are feared because they cause exits and venting; some physicians treat these with the oil of effusion, while others fear them." Here it seems to refer further on treatment methods used for certain medical issues - potentially relating back to abscesses or other conditions causing discharge. It indicates a concern about both physical symptoms (exits) as well as potential complications like venting through these exits – suggesting that proper management is necessary, sometimes involving the application of specific oils and in some cases using medicinal substances for treatment ("verm"). This text continues to provide
This line in English would be translated as follows: "For those fistulas, some remedies are applied within the cavity inside it (likely referring to a body organ or space), and into the thigh muscle; for others, they find their way between the hip joints and enter the navel." Here again we see descriptions of specific medical conditions where treatment is carried out – applying interventions either internally in an unspecified cavity (which could be interpreted as some form of internal body space or organ) into thigh muscles, possibly for abscesses. There's also mention of issues occurrdicting at the hip joint and navel region suggesting a range of symptoms that require attention during this

When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or thigh bone, it signifies that I must treat this person' extraneous urine and prevent its discharge so that the location becomes part of medicine as well.

Immediately apply heat treatment; it will not be beneficial for healing or with bandages applied at all in such cases.

If the attempt enters within and does not penetrate inside where it is contained (the groin area), between that entrance and the one expected to hold flesh or bone solidity (probably referring to an abscess near these areas), then dry out the affected region of the cyst, which lies on the skin surface associated with the inguinal area. Once dried by your hand touching it within this place where extremities are located for said purpose, and while doing so ensures that moisture reaches to exactly at the location inside what is contained in the attempt (likely an abscess), then through contact liberates and heals with respect to the attempted structure.

The cause is to administer one of three remedies: or that which cauterizes the wound as we have mentioned; or dry it inside until its cavity has been restored for you to insert hooks and treatments, preventing bile from escaping into the belly. And avoid cutting off moisture through suction so that gallstone disease may not occur in accordance with one's willful ignorance; administer as much of what we have mentioned if it is strong enough for healing. Or lengthen and burn this bandage, applying heat externally to the pus inside after winding up, using another sharp instrument or an acute tool at your disposal in order to crust over these fistulas that are within the section; perform the restoration of all flesh affected by such a condition. And if poultice applied outside does not consolidate it will rot and open the excreted pus, which becomes leukocytes as part of its body defenses in response to disease—and then this gout can spread throughout the belly through pores unblocking due to ignorance or negligence. And sometimes this method concludes the fistula according to this practice: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it enters through the skin around the navel and in the groove of the belly button, a needle is inserted there by the surgeon following this form.
And insert into that faithful covering of flesh or enclose those within it, and attempt to insert the foot in the foreskin where continuation occurs as part of its conquest.

Here come the causes for which movements are pains, such as worms in the intestine or obstruction of space with stone, splinter, blow from lance or sword, or resembling these sources of painful movement.
May the humors that are present in the body'fal as worms upon the head, neck (col), chest (pietz), belly (ventre), back (fitge), and they seem to be of those belonging to the members.
And when you recommend certain treatments for that reasoning and rule concerning other diseases, then...
When you come upon the simple diseases of the head, when the memory returns to common sense, it will arrive at the meal for third-day treatment.
Then say that when you have a simple fracture and it's not because of bone or phantom (ghost), consider: if due to apendicitis, immediately press the abdomen firmly with your hand only once, as there is much pain in this area caused by an abscess located nearby being cauterized. And then do not delay; extract out what you can from that part secondarily according to its amount unless any reason prevents further bloodletting, mainly if the sickness consists largely of phlegm (excess mucus).
When it is a surgical incision of the opposite side of the affected region, and you must protect the abdomen from retching and vomiting, as well as heavy foods.
May it be that by restraining any cause of diminution, the pain will lessen from food and not approach meat or drink.
When pressure is applied over mud or water where the patient has been immersed and treated with caustic (likely acid baths), hold on firmly until heated by these liquids for localized treatment.
If you are sure of applying caustic, pause over the ground (the patient' extrusion site), if it has been recently sealed and the dust used for application hasn’t settled yet.
If the air has changed and become humid, then place your hand inside where the linen is for it to be healed.
May it be if the child is large or due to insufficient space and appearance, and their lips are not properly adjusted for kissing, then adjust those accordingly as recommended by their surgical stitches.
May the child be discovered between bone and flesh, but not restrained by it; rather apply some small suspenderer to that area, carefully administer medicine for its healing, and command the humors within: capsules of gouty food such as grains and fruits resembling their appearance, until they are composed.
If there is rot in the chest that does not adhere to the bone, then you will drain out all this pus and apply care for it.
May if in these plagues the artery or vein through which blood may flow and is not relieved by medicine; ask about that artery/vein, and if you cut it (not intentionally), then make an incision with a sponge or ligature thereof. And if what has been said does not alleviate the discomfort, perform cauterization where the blood vessel is severed.
If these pains are simple and small, then the cause of them is fever; therefore apply powder to those areas until the air changes and alleviates those pains.
The purpose of the powder is this: take one part of pressed oil, two parts of dragon's ash, three parts not yet extingimated; mix it well and fill up herein for good constriction within which to drink from that cushion (or pillow), whereupon clotted by le sanc.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When any one applies only caustic alone, without being in current essences and sanctified snuff of dragonwood, it is not effective on its own for treatment.
And now this operation is performed on the large humors when it has been paused upon them and they are still freshly sewn together, where these fluids have not yet changed in air (not contaminated).
If the air is altered, especially in summer, you may not understand where this powder should be placed, therefore take care of those particular ingredients we have mentioned earlier; place them above these exigent substances so that they become moistened with water and honey inside—and watch over those things until they heal.
If you break a bone in your body, then it is small and required intervention be done immediately.
When directing the treatment of skull fractures caused by poison (the venom), do so accordingly in this manner.
From diseases of the colon (literally "from illnesses/diseases in the
When worms acidify within the colon, there is no difference in treatment; between a simple infestation of head lice and such conditions as these. (This translation attempts to convey that regardless of whether it's an acute issue like pediculosis ("head lice"), or something more severe involving parasites affecting the intestines, medical approaches may not significantly differ.)
When nerves or arteries of the colon are involved (literally "if it involves nerves/arteries in the colon"), there is not an intervention per se, but rather avoidance and care that prevents violent stoppage; with herbs like rue and sage applied to them until they relindict their presence from these vessels. This translation suggests a non-surgical approach focused on preventing severe complications such as hemorrhaging or blockages using specific remedies, possibly indicated by the reference to applying botanical agents directly over affected areas for relief and healing purposes. No joints remain untouched by any cause of madness; for the substance of nerves is fever and its continued state in the brain, which they place among all body members themselves.
If water is needed to treat with unrefined medicines, then some are washed in either olive oil or not-oiled stone fragments as directed by this methodology, and heat when being washed along with other stones according to this practice; lubricate the joints.
May it be that if the patient is very large, apply bandaging or trim their lips, and provide care for them until they are healed within these pills (or treatments).
If there is depth or acidity in the lower parts of the body cavities where they are pierced by disease (pus), then through that place you must penetrate with a goose needle to drain it out.
If in the flesh an artery is found and blood flow has been achieved, separate or dry out that one if necessary to induce effusion (fluid accumulation).
May you have already fused the vertebrae of the spine or all, and thus saved the veins in the neck; do not touch that part with your lips but adjust it over the curve of the spine according to its natural shape, strengthen this area through strain for several days until healed. Take care of these areas where fusing has occurred so as they may recover fully.
May it happen that the child already has pain in their bone, then you will strike that place; and if there are fragments of a hip joint present, extract all those which you can from them; but if they cannot be removed within you, allow water to enter so that the child'thy flesh may moisten, and it shall separate out with ease.
If the patient is recently born then grind over that powder which has been recommended for you. If there is an opening in the patient (plaga), then tend to that which will remember it within its own cavity at their head (seua Capitola).
If it is a thrust of lance or club and sometimes the depth, pay attention to whether the fever arises when the malady enters (the body); understand that the fever indicates death in the worm.
If there is no depth and the patient has recently passed stool (constipation), then you pause in the rectum during the first hour after mealtime to ensure that nothing remains stuck within it, allowing for its return to the chest cavity where it aids digestion. Hereafter, if needed, apply lubricating enema and relieve constipation gradually throughout the day.
If the ointment is not at hand, then pause in the bathroom where water has collected from above to allow it for your body'se sake; and make sure that gout lies over the mud so as its fluid can flow out of itself which is adjusted herein.
Mays if already three days have passed or more and you do not worsen the malady with spasm, tremor of illness-causing spirit in excesses nor constriction by internal fire, then use at your discretion all other beneficial means available to you; consequently take care for this patient' extramay calming balm and look after any further remedies until they are healed.
If the sanitation of him is sufficient and he has been bathed for a long time already, then you will know that an abscess has formed; therefore attend to it using your own remedy.
If the patient has a fracture through an opening or from falling on their knee or buttocks and it is simple upon touch of the skin over bone or joint, then heal that with water (if large) used for suturing, or powder if small.
If there is pain before the eyes and if the stones are separated from each other, then use a tool to extract those stones. If they are not separated, let them be led out that the vermin may escape from them.
From other accidents affecting the other limbs, health is restored with the water we have mentioned before.
From intestinal discharges/fluid (This translation is based soledictly off modern medical termin
The condition that causes pain in the stomach can be either great or small (or perhaps it has migrated). This medieval medical text suggests varying degrees and possible movements of discomfort within the abdomen ("the belly"). Here is a line-by-line translation:
A slight disruption is felt difficultly by others (implying that the symptoms experienced can be hard to understand or interpret without specific knowledge), and it becomes challenging, if not impossible, to reduce them unless one intervenes promptly in their location – which then results as the body encumbers itself for lack of immediate action on this intrusion. This passage emphasizes urgency when addressing internal issues that could exacerbate or be worsened by neglect ("se ubre" - a likely metaphorical term relating to bodily response, where 'engrossat' implies being overwhelmed). The translation communicates the medieval understanding of symptoms as something requiring immediate and possibly complex intervention (reduction) when internal issues are left unchecked. It highlights an early recognition that timely medical attention is crucial
Therefore the best or most severe disturbance can migrate – and in that case it is difficult not only to treat such an internal distress but also when dealing with special organs (likely referring herein as 'the specific parts'), which could be alluding again to distinct abdominal regions, each possibly requiring expert knowledge for proper assessment. This statement underscs the complexity and potential severity of conditions where intervention is needed; it implies that such issues may not
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And you know that an abdominal (belly) stitch is performed with four manners, and such sutures are common for other wounds on the body as well.
When two other stitches communicate with each other or themselves in the abdominal stitch, it may be both ways and within that same intestinal stitching.
Here enters your opportunity for examination and declaration.
So when the child is small and suffers from some cause of the intestine (budel), it becomes difficult to reduce that, either because of its diminutive size or due to inflammation caused by cold air:
And when water is drunk, now it'thy turn to take action: cut that which you submerge in the wet cloth alone or squirming into the water by itself, and cloves, pepper, spice, and ointments go into where inflammation should be resolved.
When some measures are taken in which water has been used, it is better than the water alone for the resolution of inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in the cavity where it was protruded and with a little cause; thus the internal organ returns to its natural place within the body.
If there is relief from the inside of him for this treatment, then divide the rupture into small pieces with a tool to which they have been previously applied.
The initial text translates line by line as follows in English:
From the tool, take its form:
One sharp blow from the hammer and another non-sharp strike, as well as a subtle touch that is not of tendon like nature; all these are blunt instruments with which one must be careful to avoid injury.
And when the child is swolthy and it comes out of its bag (referring to an intestinal prolapse or hernia), let its reduction be according to its natural shape in their own place, if at all feasible above them, which would even better for recovery.
When the disruption is wide and it occurs in the lower part of the abdomen, then make sure that you press the hernia against their two shoulders, and place cushions under them so that their head rests on top; if it's below the abdomen, put a cushion or pillow beneath your patient’s chest and neck.
Here comes the first sentence for translation: If disruption is in one of the parts of the belly, then stop your thinking and consider immediately so that what has already come out can be pushed back inside.
And when you attend to this fluid in large and moving pus,
In small pains, pause what you have prepared for it, and ensure that the minister is between your most pained parts; this tongue holds disruption in its entirety at their mouth and adjusts lips there as well to close any stitch made by themselves or others due to these minor issues.
Here is the line-bydependent translation of the medieval medical treatise:
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English line by line:
Here come the sharp needles between inflammation and subtlety, where small ones move into flesh; while large ones struggle in the groin area, thus causing them to shift towards both fineness and coarseness.
And where the needle is placed in either of the patient'thy extremities provided for, to prevent the flesh from being pierced and blood rushing forth before its healing.
And they are not sewn up for that the patient should not be prevented from healing (consolidation).
Here's the line by line translation:
These small surgical instruments have sharp needles placed in them for convenience during the stitching of their wounds; it is enough to use either an individual needle or two together as required by those sewing.
Here is the translation line by line:
When the needle has penetrated these four extremities, reduce the needle of that piece cut by them, so that the wound' extraneous part is pulled back into its lower cavity through it, so that the suture made from cloth on which the clothes are tightly stretched.
When there is a pause between each stitch of said body part, it refers to the thickness or size of that particular area being measured for stitching purposes.
This stitch knows men.
E as soon as the suture was put in place, there was a child inside that home who had become ill in his stomach; he suffered from what appeared to be an intestinal obstruction of one palm's size and was affected by distention (swelling) due to trapped bubbles within the gut—this disruption occurred two handsbreadth away from where gas accumulated, after having been there for 24 hours.
And after fifteen days or so, the plague is consolidated in those spaces, and treatment for it occurs thereafter; apply moisture with urgency due to time'dictum, and discuss its conditions within oneself.
E the other physicians had not healed him; and through a miracthy lamp, they could no longer treat that wound which was neither treated with ointment nor any medicine applied therein, perhaps cured by drinking two cups of honey water within sight every day while bathing in the waters of melting snow.
May you direct two kinds of stitches according to Paracelsus's accounting.
When you begin stitching the tongue, and insert the needle from the divided fore section to the divided hind teeth.
Therefore, when the needle enters into the coccyx and then moves upwards along all of it according to rectification and lengthening from top to bottom; make sure that once you have inserted the needle in the hollow where you previously entered it, also insert the other end of the parted instrument at the divided extremity of my flesh.
When you have pain in that area, then make another passage of the same kind between those two parts of the body; and let the outside cavity come into contact with each other so that the needle can penetrate from one extremity to the other within this place.
Here is the line by line translation into English:
Here begins the treatment from this side of the body and removes that which is inside, placing it in that same place within the coccyx where another has been positioned on the other side's extremity; also remove what therefrom at its source within the coccyx. Extract (remove) the needle located under the tailbone to this part of itself and into the area opposite the existing protrusion observed here.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
The sum total of this suture management is that you sew with a thread meant for fur (which the threads make up), stitching along the extremity part of the limb, leaving another such stitch until it's completed.
May the second special kind of suture that Gualia speaks about and recommends through speech is one you yourself create with half-wit (i.dictually implying someone not fully aware or competent), which he/she, as well being a medic, creates for another person at their convenience according to nature; they apply the end of it from themselves and attach it onto each other's ends accordingly, doing so when advised by them in Gualia’s instructions.
When you keep the needle in the distal part of your hand, and make that enter into the wound therein at that place, and turn over the needle so that it enters from two fingers to those digits on the chest; thus rotate the needle and have that penetrate through.
When those bursae are rotated, and fluid from the inflamed joint inside enters into its counterpart in either of the limbs' parts opposite to it on this side (implying a possible imbalance or misalignment),
This stitching is better than simple sewing thread for wound healing and it's the one from which they remember to close a wound.
This is the discourse of Guiliel or William (assuming "Gualia" refers to a
Here may your thread or needle be straightened with two pins in the abdomen so that you can insert these into some joints, and begin inserting this very sharp tool of yours deep within those threads corresponding to their suture work where they join together inside the body cavity.
When there is a disturbance in the intestinal region of the abdomen, it becomes difficult to sew here as compared with other parts of the abdomen.
The art of medicine for infants is judgment regarding other diseases.
The cause is when you continue the recent plague as it affects their sanctum currently and return the intestine (budel) back to its cavity; thereafter rest over that luminous skin, thus making those parts fit again.
If the air has altered the humors and they have entered into that place within you wherein clothes are worn, causing hardness of skin and fields to swell up; having solidified their pus and spots as treatment for other diseases is present therewith - then take care of this fever with what was done previously.
If you do not have the medicines present at this moment, then place them here immediately as it begins to draw blood and pus, allowing two days for recovery with your presence and teaching; provided that you are healed from other maladies which may be in minor disposition when these troubles appear.
If you fear that the vermin will cause injury to the main body parts, then submerge wool in warm bath oil or vinegar, and keep it there while placing your hands over the areas between the joints where limbs meet bones (the angles), so as not to expose them.
If there is pain or putrefaction in your intestines, they wander aimlessly within you; and if the obstruction has reached the intestine and it feels as though coming out through its cavity, then:
Be aware that what is of larger intestine origin heals better than what resides in the small intestines.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: It is difficult for the intestine that they are calling "gegunu" to receive treatment from outside in this body; and it's because of the many veins present here, as well as their large size within these, and due to its delicacy according to its nature concerning nerves.
If what you are processing from the dirt is silk (implying that doctors at times used materials like linen or wool), then obtain it directly, and cut it as per your refined skill on which you reduce swellings by pressing them down manually.
If space has been passed through and black or dark substance has entered therein already, then you must tighten that faithful hand over the place where it is discolored, in order for the effluent of blood (or pus) to be expelled from the vessels.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Remember when illnesses occur in the intestine (budel).
When you injure the intestine and it is desired to be restored in some way at home, then come here those who were already suffering from inflammation inside their abdomen due to a punch thrown by lance during palpitation (abdominal examination), wherein there was an old worm-infested with fistula causing distress and wind motion.
Now you apply the treatment to him and it may cease subtly; furthermore, that which is focused on healing will solidify where recovery has begun.

Return some pressure or massage on the first formed part and do not cease until another is formed according to the amount of all the humors in the body.
Reduce those things within it, and remove the excess contained therein from the intestine inside so that the intestine is healed; do not harm any part of its nature for evil'dictation to such diseases or humors.
Here comes the translation of each line:
This technique of stitching is only a second means of trust and hope.
If the child is large and wide, mainly if it's in one of the small intestines (budel), then it cannot be easily managed or treated internally; thus, there will not be a cure for them here at all.
Of joint care and hernia treatment.
You understand that when a child or appendicitis occurs and itching happens everywhere without healing over time nor detaching from the entire body in any part, universally we call this an ulcer; thus, we seek out its origin for treatment.
E fistula according to truth is a tightly woven, hard, white fabric where there is no pain and it feels comfortable like the relief of suffering; thus they apply warm urine (or liniment), that is, the same remedy for pain.
It is moisture in which they bathe (referring likely to the body's limbs or torso), and if it persists for some hours, this excess fluidity has been reduced. Some movements of this fluidity occur, they are scant and heavy, and subtle.
And have shown all those causes and their ailments are the subject of our medicine in division.
When you understand the treatment for this opening, which occurs through surgery on your body,
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And therefore this one among these ulcers that come from the illness mentioned here is not treatable and does not receive care, engaging in labor and ignorance instead.
If there is any depth to the ulcer that does not reach these locations mentioned herein and you expect healing from it, and wish for knowledge of it, then take iron or barber's tools; if the ulcer continues as rectified, inquire about it with him.
May it be that if the fistula is twisted, then investigate carefully what subtle metal underlies your body' extrusion and curvature; for when this underlying metal (presumably a metallic foreign object or implant) of one's own limb causes such issues.
If there is an abscess with frightening contents present, it is not within your power to attempt on them.
And now apply the poultice on his body with these ointments; as for the moisture used in this enema, it will be absorbed by other ointments and from their bodies.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When you have stood over all these causes and see them clearly, then go to the healing according to your confidence: for you consider whether it is an apparent fistula nearby or far from joint connection, nerve, artery, vein, or one of those places where there should be within you.
When dryness reaches as stated by the nature of it herein described, and what is present in that filtration which arose from decayed or corrupt flesh (flesh, limb fragment), including things born within its cavity such as worms and resembling creatures; heal whatever inside has been affected.
May it be that the fistula is deep-seated and secondarily rectified; then you must insert that into the prepuce as far as possible according to your strength, and purify all of their corrupted flesh with healing salves enveloped in sharp medicines, inserting them within the cavity of the fistula, which you have understood by iron.
When some of that which has been dislodged enters the cavity of the fistula due to corruption, medicine sharply removes it over a few days.
And restore that which is within wax-like substances, as they produce healthy flesh inside while being healed.
May it not be healed by this water, then apply that treatment second which we have recommended.
May if the cause of fistula is within and you need to certify it, then inquire about that specific one as recommended, provided that you do not forbid any potential causes related to veins or nerves, as we have mentioned.
If you discover your bones and there is any decay or impurity within, then treat that area where the decay resides completely; take care of the fluid inside so it can heal what'seems to be sickened in this body.
If you are not healthy and sickly as before in your ways of life, then understand that you have not yet reached the complete eradication of corruption; hence observe carefully over yourself again with extreme attention to cleanse both your body'dictum (or essence) and purification on it thoroughly until now. Only after this will you restore what was lost previously.
So if you heal, eat; and if not, then understand that the corruption is in the deep interior of the body which has not been achieved, and accordingly take action therein.
If the bone is rotten or it may be thrown away from you (i.thy), then throw that with subtle forceps as needed.
If your bones are weakened (motze), then very carefully extract all of them without leaving any cause for doubt from your strength (fortalte).
May if any cause of the humors arises and there is no fear or mistake in their knowledge, then inspect those ligaments or bones here present, and divide them into pieces (presumably for further examination).
If you are not prepared with the tools to work on your bones at this hour, then place a cushion under that which will moisten and keep wet what is needed for those bone pieces made of cartilage and sinew, ensuring it does not harden while keeping in mind the section you have already outlined in your operation.
Habitant when fear grips them below the surface submerged in so much oil above or within any of their greasy liniments, and then those bands are separated from each other causing bone separation; it is through these that they have been led astray.
May if there is a great bone obstruction in the knee or thigh joints (or similar), and as long as it comes from there, only let that which goes out be taken for so long, until such time that that evil and corruption has been removed enough to allow recovery of health.
May if the matter that has been spoiled from within is a great part of it and has already reached the bone marrow (medulla), then it becomes necessary to close this area where corruption arrived, and care for it so that it may become solidified inside therein.
E you recommend that he apply some warmth to his thighs so as to simplify and assist with your work.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And now the fever is spread to that place because of the error made by doctors within which pus accumulates, and its treatment should be done with a measured pause until the fistula'seated focus has been managed; in it all treatments using hot irons are applied where they touch patient parts, absorbing their moisture.

Return and examine quickly those preparations above for all parts of the change (of position, treatment procedure).
And then I cut and incised into one of the orifices within which I disarticulated that bone, and tore apart that corrupted part, it was already rock-hard and decayed; moreover, there was also ruined a section inside where something had penetrated to the marrow.
Adjust the water that I have discovered and prepared for bone (or in this context, likely referring to an infusion or remedy).
And if it was not in the bone but that which had broken and closed up therein already has been reduced/cured: for this reduction or healing is already achieved.
Return the remaining restoration of the patient' extraneous humors by medicine with prolonged application and it is not solidified or stabilized yet.
Return and explore further above the second bone of the skull from where it was discovered first, while applying continued treatment to prevent harm to the bone.

No iteration is necessary in the operation of his and her body parts except for the disposition of their humors and tolerance to pain and death fear, as they will proceed throughout all hours due to excessive bowel movements (synchronous evacuation).
Therefore, it heals entirely, and nothing remains of the hardened flesh there; good is its disposition in their body, which they return to normality; conversed among themselves without causing any disturbance or harm during walking or for any reason.
If the bone protrudes in the location where it has been thrust and you see that: then take hold of a ligament and tighten it at the extremity of that which is projecting, command your assistant to stretch this out on them; pull apart the first thickened band from there (the one being held), place it over the flesh that is in contact with the protruded bone, extend the part where they are located so you can tear away the tissue at those places for which you wish to cut.
When you lower a sword or stool for examination, it is allowed when the blade does not corrupt the decaying flesh.
When the screw is gradually applied to the damaged area and if it does not appear in its actual manifestation within the cavity of the bone where damage occurs, then take care with the remaining part of the instrument used for this purpose.
If the os (bone) is decayed and not prominent, it indicates continuous damage in one area or another within/at that location; when this happens you discover all of the affected flesh throughout these parts – now pause with two blows swiftly after detecting where corruption has occurred inside what continues to be damaged from previous strikes.
And when a small incision is made at the site of decay as previously mentioned.
If the impairment is in the joint, then cut out that damaged joint and continue cutting with your hands from there.
If decay is in the continuous flow of pains through joints, it is not by reason but due to other causes (likely implying non-medical or non-natural reasons). Here 'corrupcio' likely refers to a breakdown or dysfunction; ‘continuo’ means ongoing/constant and implies that something
If the decay is within the flesh of the belly or body, it's difficult; but if you inquire about this corruption and remove what appears to be causing it according to any available means at your disposal, and cleanse that which has been removed thoroughly for humane reasons only (not against one’s will), then the illness may rectify itself when not caused by external forces like venom or nervous disturbance. Here 'corrupcio' likely refers again to decay or impairment; ‘pecte de ma o pe’ means belly flesh/body; and “engen” implies natural causes, which should be distinguished from supernatural influences in the context of medieval medicine (such as curses). The text suggests a proactive approach where one identifies internal sources causing illness within their body that are not external ('vena' or 'nervi'), indicating an understanding among these practitioners that certain conditions can indeed originate internally and be remedied through proper examination, removal of harmful substances (which
Understand which tools are necessary and where they should be placed concerning the bones, taking into account their size, grittiness, fineness or smallness; so that everything you prepare for any kind of operation is suitable to its purpose (implying tailoring surgical instruments appropriately). Here 'escidi' likely means "to cut" in preparation for an operative procedure. The text advises the importance of selecting and positioning tools correctly relative to bone characteristics such as their size, coarseness or smoothness ('grosseza', indicating texture; ‘subtilitud’ refers finesse), density (‘parvitat'), and hardness/rarity – all aspects which must be considered when preparing instruments for surgery. The goal is that everything prepared will meet the specific requirements of each operative situation, underscoring a meticulous approach to medicine consistent with medieval practice where anesthetic techniques were not present as they are today.
Be aware that this operation concerns the specific instrument you are using; when you have great knowledge and experience in these instruments as well as witnesses of diseases, then you already possess what is necessary for your treatment according to the needs of each patient'dicty (Latin term meaning 'knowledge').

And the name of that person to whom you have caused pain, is because their limb was cut where the flame struck and redness entered into it within which treatment your touch has applied, thus causing inflammation in that part; hence know this as well inside out.
When it comes down to the similarity of causes due to poisoning, either by sea serpent (scorpius marinus), or worms (venomous creatures) and mixtures/mixtions, etc., all these can lead to corruption through percussion.

When an ulcer forms on the flesh of the legs and the space within the ulcer extends as long as it takes to collect disease, then remove and perforate (it), causing this illness in you; apply salve herein with what was used beforehand like ointment. No further corruption has reached the bone or nerves/tendons yet, no fistula is formed, only swelling—so it's called by its tongue name alone (without additional complications).

Such is the case where their veins are large and visibly thickened, coming to those that contain hard stones within them.
This incisional tool is of lesser length and subtle delicacy; it's suitable for the surgery on small vessels that contain thin, clear blood.
May the strength of the basilic vein extraction be one of three veins: where it exits from above and below the navel (belly button), and between the waist and chest, holding onto maladies that come downward.
When the barber comes for bloodletting and ensures that he maintains control over it during the procedure as soon as he begins drawing blood, if he makes a mistake in performing or adjusting at the puncture site of the barber, he will insert that artery therein and cause bleeding to stop so that no further unintentional cutting by the barber occurs with their knife.
If the basilica does not appear for overt manifestation, then you must lay it down and replace with another (perhaps a different one), or if any wound on your arm is evident where they finish, that very same area will show signs; apply bandaging to said location as we have discussed.
If you wish to perform the surgery on your patient, first address the narrowing of the arm that you touch within which you become familiar with the location of the wrists; secure a leather strap around his vein in the curved section where we previously discussed performing the operation together; take care not to press too hard.

When the black vein is cut for bleeding extraction from above and below the head portion of the body part as well as around the joints; this consists largely of bone marrow and cranial (brain) bone, which we have mentioned before.
Even if the patient is fearful during the operation of their veins (fleebotomia), and every time such anxiety occurs it's a nerve; thus when you adjust in the puncture of the fleebotomy, crush the nerve, causing fainting at that moment, making recovery difficult, and only partially healing—this nervous movement relates to feeling. If this fear is hidden from others (or subtle) and not shown/displayed by them during their vein puncture, then you pause your fleebotomy over the part of which the patient has a limb segment attached ('alcessi', meaning thigh or leg), preventing injury to that nerve serving as its base.
If a vein is between two nerves, then you make the vein lengthy there.
The puncture of the jugular vein is that it draws out the blood from the head and relieves the humors (fluids) in the body.

If I find it small and subtle, fearing that too much will be removed if action is taken immediately, then perform the circumcision in this distressful situation promptly (quickening) to ensure precise application of restraint on where you intend for amputation; because once an area has been designated as a site for removal due to necessity or disease state there should only be minimal intervention.
May you see that cauterization has been applied to it, and do not move over it anymore, for there is no excuse; pause above any opening in the wound'dict (the "fenda de oli"), which alleviates the pain of the body. It is better in this place than where others are present.

When you extract from the sanction according to the patient'dict quantity and appearance, then draw out accordingly with respect to time.
If the sanction is black (indicating a problem or illness), then you should take it inside where there may be asked for help; and if you see that it's large, taking it inside becomes more careful; similarly, when gout appears, ensure its heat does not escape.

May that part of the body where motion has been made and cut also becomes hot and causes fever; because it is generated within a pregnancy (possibly referring to arthritis exacerbated by pregnancy) with great quantity, which amplifies penetration when you fall unconscious. Therefore, if you maintain all the conditions of fracture treatment; keep your hand on his chest where there is pain in that part affected by motion and cutting (likely referring to a joint), so it does not die out suddenly at places of syncope (loss of consciousness). This often occurs when the bone fixer ignores or neglects their duty.

But if it is possible to let the place of wind release and move in water motion (potentially referring to applying hydrotherapy or simply exposing wounds), this action can be beneficial, addressing both inflammation and expression/draining of pathological substances.
If the leg of sanctus is extended and blood from hemorrhoids comes out, then you press a wet linen on it to stop that which has come out.
If the sanction is multiplied, sprinkle vitriol that has been thrice ground, or small stones and galleys attributed to its causes onto it; then the sanction will fall apart; when beans have dried on this spot, the condition falls away.
And if necessary, repeated applications of bloodletting, when possible changing those.
If blood stoppings are prohibited from suspension, then it is to be flogged in the area where fresh pain arises or leave an awl inserted into those places where there is burning; and they should remain thus until I sense any other new pain pressing upon me.
When you wish for a poultice on those areas, apply only a little ash from the hearth (or salt or charcoal), and place it there immediately.
Ayssi begins the course of restoration: from recovery. This chapter is necessary in the practice of medicine; it concerns restoration and treatment for bone fractures and displacements.
Oh child, know that the learned doctors and scholubes here boast of this chapter (capitol), which they might not have once regarded as free from Antiquity or read their letters in such ways beforehand.
For this reason the disease of these learned men on our land is denied; and it has never been ignored at any time before now; nor have I neglected to apply anything after reading the works of ancient philosophers, until extracting knowledge from them.

Capital First.
Summed up collections of bone fragments that are necessary before we begin to recall the members and various kinds of broken bones. Here we go, translating each line into English:
And when you have caused a fracture or dislocation or twisting injury, it is necessary that you sit with the patient for cauterization of that very bone fragmentation or displacement, provided no specific reason prevents such action; this might be because they are suffering from weakness, extreme old age, intense heat causing feverish conditions, or severe overheating.
E restore its content with tender herbs and parts of wild plants (vegetables) from birds and poultry; prohibit large meats and fill it up entirely with food that fills the veins in the body, ensuring careful administration to prevent leakage into any part of the body.
And return the humors (fluids) of the body back to its original place, where it customarily circulates within itself.
And when the bone breaks begins to be repaified, at that time it is necessary for them (doctors) to provide nourishing foods rich in large and heavy nutrients whose viscosity helps healing; similarly with flour-based dishes cooked in water along with rice, fruits, vegetables from cows' bellies, veal, chicken guts fresh or salted grains for these purposes.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: E sapias che le ossi trinquassero quando sono negli uomini di cui si trovano nei loro corpi inferiori e decrépiti, non è possibile che continuino a essere staccate e consolidate secondo la natura dei loro membri per via dell'essiccazione.
Nature adjusts and supports over the broken bones of any part caused by excess similar to gout in which there is thickening that you hold inside when patients are conglutinated (tightly contracted), as if with a focus on communion, even though no cause prohibits performing such actions.
For this reason it is necessary that we pause the foods of humors which have weight and thickness, as we have mentioned.
Remember that the types of breaks vary according to the variety of limbs, for a bone break in the arm is different from a bone break in the shoulder blade; and the leg bone fracture differs from the hip joint's fracture; similarly all other parts are various between them.
When you remember all types of bone fracture, separated in this text from the other.
Motley of different types of fracture may occur in themselves (patients). Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
The entire specialty is in restoring proper function after each patient'se specific location recall:

When the coastline breaks, it means that large sections are being separated or fractured into big pieces; and from their extremities during departure, they do not fall directly onto those chunks but rather due to fluidity of water which is slippery like slate. This suggests a natural process where broken shoreline fragments get carried by the sea's motion without direct contact with each other because of how smoothly moving in water acts similarly to flat stones, reducing friction and resistance during transportation caused by waves or currents affecting those coastal pieces post-fracture.

In translating "Capitol .x." from a medieval medical treatise context, it seems
The bones of the large ones are broken, and if they break, it is not a simple fracture but communication in their extremities; these travel down to the parts where joints meet them—their long axis declines here too—and cause pain at the location and puncture. Whenever there's such damage or cracking of bones within large structures (like limbs), it results not just a fracture, but also an injury that spreads along their extremities down to joint areas where they converge with other parts; this causes acute pain at the site and through puncturing. The mention implies immediate medical attention is required for proper diagnosis and treatment—likely involving splinting (the 'cushion' mentioned) or some form of binding ('servants') along these limbs to address fractures, which can be severe enough that they require careful immobilization possibly alongside other remedies as
The restoration of it (the body part with the fracture) is that you should place your hand over where there'supremacy, which refers to placing a form of support or protection directly on top of and around the area affected by the break in order to aid recovery. In modern medical terminology, this would typically mean applying splinting
If the break is in just one limb (extremity), you should envelop it next, which means wrapping or bandaging that part of the body; this wrap must conform to its normal shape—likely suggesting immobilization and support tailored to maintain proper alignment while healing. In contemporary medical practice, appropriate care would involve applying a splint in such a way as not only restrict movement but also align limb correctly for optimal recovery from fracture-related injuries like yours.
If the fracture is long or already decreasing at its parts, then declare the malady on your abdomen while you prepare to restore that broken bone. And when you have applied the plaster to that area, pause over it with a wooden or bone splint for tightness on which one should not fear piercing for a fracture nor removal of the spine.
When the cavity is filled with fluid that occupies it equally according to its capacity, and commands the hump (gout) to lie on their back or between their shoulder blades as necessary, here comes the first source sentence translated into English line by line:
If you apply an ointment, then cease stretching it out and its restoration within until that which is applied has settled down in place; at this time return the limb to its state of repair, and tightly clamp on the leg wherein stands assisted.
If you feel pain in your shins or they are fractured, then treat them.

And another symptom is that the humidity rises upon the patient's seat and suspends its hand from under their collarbone due to fracture in their hands; two servants are commanded by them, one using fingers of both hands (their mouth) over the breakage, while the other places it directly beneath themselves.
If you wish the extension to be strong, then grasp it at the joint and on those other ligaments as well, so that both of these ministers stretch each of their parts.
Therefore, if the fracture is near the limb' extrémity, then it must be held with a splint on the joint and at other times hold the fractured part itself.
And if it seems that there is a break in the bone of the groin area and needs to be immobilized on that spot as well as on the hip, then take measures accordingly with bandaging or splinting over those areas.

Capitol .xii. (The label "Capitol .x
From bone fracture treatment." or "Concerning the management of a broken arm." in English
The arm is composed of two bones which are called 'fingers'; the smaller one is where they call your thumb and the larger finger that comes out from there." This passage seems to be explaining anatomy in a way typical for medieval medical texts, likely referencing how different parts of the arm (specifically referring to fingers) relate within its structure. The text indicates two distinct bones or 'fingers,' with one being smaller ('your thumb') and another larger which is directly connected from it.
And only when the main or small fire is broken down entirely, and their sparks have been collected together fully.
When the small flame below is broken, then its restoration and healing for that person become easier.
When the patient's fire is broken late at night, their bone breakage becomes bad and healing gets difficult.
When that which was in it breaks two or more bones,
So if the bone that is broken is the small one above (possibly referring to a fractured hip or shoulder blade), it is convenient for the doctor; you must restore this, which requires only slight extension until such time as he can bear weight on it.
May it be that if a great fire is what one has touched upon (possibly referring to heat from metalwork or something similar), then they must cease the forceful extension immediately.
If the two fires are joined together, then when you pause the extraction motion, press strongly.
When the figure of the hand must be rested and extended over a pillow, placing their palms on parts below them, as well as putting ears near those hands with others holding all this, while malady is placed under an inverted chair.
And if there is a hernia present at that moment under the patient or above their chest, this prevents the malady from worsening further.

If there appears in it (the patient) a separate stone that pierces the navel and is not within your hope for its restoration, then you must act on it according to our guidance above mentioned.
May it be that if the bone is still green (fresh/unhealed), you have pain in a single spot (localized pain at one area), and therefore take care of that specific place.
If you lance an abscess on the patient's restoration site, then tie your linen with rotten oil and white wax fabric, and insert between tightness and subtlety; place this cloth over where the abscess is strictured so that it subsides; remove the wax wrap and apply a poultice made of powdered clay moistened by clear water, placing pause stones on top of the fracture you have laid down and set firm.
Be aware that the name of the bones in the arm is found within major configurations or a fracture at one or two points simultaneously engaged.

Consider the body part and its limber days. (This line suggests that one should pay attention not only to the physical state of the patient'dicts but also their flexibility or If you discover any cause that requires correction, address the ailment on its body part immediately with water poured at your hand to prevent said pouring until the discomfort ceases. (This line advises immediate intervention for an identified health issue using direct contact and possibly warmth from one's hands.)
Lay down your limb within so as it rests and return the tightness.
If extraction has become softened and the bone appears similar to these things, then straighten out all of it by your own effort (the treatment).
Consider if the nourishment is prohibited to prevent for excessive tightness of the limb, and when it comes within reach again during the days until one can have that sustenance, strengthen that little bit and hold on those days.
May if there is no cause in the thighs for those things we have mentioned here, do not attempt to extract it within two days or send them among these.
And return its belly attached to it for reasons of motion disrupted by excessive activity, and have him sleep on his back.
Be aware that this fracture will be healed in either xxx days or xxxii days, and at the most it will take xxviii days, all according to the complexity of the injury and disposition of the body.

Extend the minister' extruded bones and apply these within where they are properly connected.
When you place an emplastrum and bandage, if it does not heal the ulceration, adjust the placement of the splint according to the size of the wound area; by now, you have wrapped that part in cloth.
If the bruise is in the parts of the intestines, and it seems like drapery (a cloth), then order the malady to tighten that area with its hand on the bruised part; make the drapery long as well.
And if it is necessary for the body'dictorium to lie on the cloth wherein they are lifted upwards, tightly clasp that part with one hand and hold firmly therewith by means of two hands.
If the fracture is at the extremities, then stop below these two stones from that part of the body in your palm so that it rests and locks; also pause the swelling, as you turn it back to between the thigh muscles using your hand.
If you have caused a fracture to one of the knee bones (femur), and it is indeed the thighbone, then gently apply pressure on top with your palm as well if you wish; pause for three days so that the fracture can elevate and not become swolthy.
May it be so if the fracture is in any of those places mentioned here (in the pubis, genital region, earlobe, or ankle ring), like that bone we are talking about there; then handle and treat each one as you would with them down here in their feet. If they continue to heal together naturally without intervention, it is better; if not, pause over the smallest stone (a small lump of formed blood clot) just as when treating these below in the foot area.
Consider it in your treatment, and position that which is applied as a cautionary measure during the operation—that which intervenes when you encounter any cause related to what has been narrated about them.

When the pubic bone is moved and bruised, it becomes apparent as pain in that area when one's body returns to normal activity or while resting on their backside. This suggests an injury possibly related to impactful physical strain during movement or exercise. The phrase indicates a direct correlation between bodily motion (denoting potential athletic endeavors) and the exacerbation of pain in this region, which aligns with common symptoms observed
The healing process is initiated with the use of a strong bandage applied directly over the break and another placed around it to immobilize further; simultaneously, there's an impact on their abdomen (their belly) and face as well which could indicate additional stress or discomfort in those areas potentially due to guarding behavior from pain. The use of multiple bandages aims at stabilizing the fractured pubic bone while limiting movement, thus providing protection against further injury during healing periods where mobility may be restricted and causing secondary effects on nearby body regions
The minister extends the bandage throughout its entirety corresponding to when the bone is immobile within the socket of flesh and structure – suggesting that as soon as there's little or no movement at all in the affected area, indicating a state where fracture might have settled down into position. This careful application underscores an attentive approach aimed at
Should there be an indication of displacement within the pubic bone ('razitz'), then applying pressure to that specific area on their body ensures tightness in both bandages; this implies a methodical approach whereby one must keep firm control over all external support structures, namely each layered wrap or dressing. The dual application here is key – not only does it serve as immediate containment (to prevent further displacement), but also provides consistent compression ('extensio caja'), which can be critical for reducing swelling and promoting a conducive healing environment around the injury site, in accordance with medieval medical theories of body mechan

If the child winks away (sic), then you must clench your teeth tightly so that they grind against each other while looking down at them; provided there is no other cause for this behavior.
When you begin to repair the fracture on that day, do not extend it further unless an ulcer forms.
May you apply cauterization if there is an ulcer present; should the restoration occur within a day after treatment begins (when it starts to recede), then do not treat again on the third and fourth days, as this may cause further complications.
If the bone is broken over the pubic bone, then it should be quickly and easily immobilized by you with your own means for a little while until further help arrives.
May it not be due to overextension and the position of your limbs, then reduce that part which is towards you; this structure made from iron, whose length ranges between seven or eight feet (or approximately 21-24 feet) and whose width corresponds proportionally to the amount of leather needed for these purposes. Hence, it becomes necessary for a doctor who must use tools appropriate for such treatment in all cases of fracture healing.

The restoration of him is that the malady ascends upon his two legs and extends their bones. Return (or apply) pressure at the location with your hand as it also serves for strengthening compression therapy and returning thereafter.
Return your hand above that bandage and press firmly upon it.
May the extremity of that which presses on their coyde and continues there, not dislocated in any day; provided it is reduced and anointed as we have said and as you are equipped to do so.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Place pressure on that bandage, and warmth (and perhaps drainage), commanding the humors within it to settle into tranquility and healing while inside there is still a cure process happening.
At this moment of healing in the physician'thy hand, reduction is made on the extent of the muscle when separated from its place.
Given that this text is from what seems like an old medical manuscript or treat
The translation of the phrase "de la reduccio de la dislocacio del muscle" into English would be "of the reduction of a mus
The translation provided seems to refer to three different methods for addressing what is interpreted as muscle displacement (dislocation). Here's the translated English version:
E for the second reason is that it's dislocated above the muscle segment, and this displacement occurs here, not behind due to shoulder issues nor in front through nerve problems.
Mostly it is a displacement and departure of the body from its place, particularly in those parts where veins are thin (thin-veined areas), which makes dislocation happen; perhaps also when muscles themselves have contractions. It mostly occurs after being tickled there.
And when the cold acid touches or is rubbed upon his body through palpation (or friction), and he has a contracted muscle due to numbness that already exists, it gets agitated by this action.
Now that you exhale what has entered into it and are overseated of the patient, proceed with their treatment.
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English line by line:
If it is a dislocation of the joint or limbs and you apply traction without fear, do not hesitate.
From this dislocation it is felt that cooling and bringing down (the malady) occurs when the abdomen becomes cold, leading to such a situation where the condition manifests itself as lightness in feeling due to reduction of swelling or inflammation.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If it does not return, and thus the dislocation occurs in a few days, then:

If you wish to perform this action: and make present a home that is long than the groin area, located on that side of it, insert your muscle quickly into the groin area until the groin suspends in air, while another servant draws out (presumably fluid or gas) from below. If the thigh is loose, then I will see that another cause locks it down again to prevent serious displacement of it backward.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another method of treatment involves placing a long staff on which figure is drawn with mortar and pestle that isn'thy thick nor thin; place its rest upon the head of the stick, hernia in position along the length of the stick accordingly placed parts. Stretch out his body from other limb part by strengthening it therewithin quickly returned juncture to proper location with speediness.
If it is difficult to reduce him for all the reasons mentioned before, then use this treatment method: grasp a staff with an amount that extends beyond two arm'se lengths and its trajectory should be four steps long. The size of his body part (likely referring to male genitalia based on context) will expand in alignment with the thigh according to these instructions:
Ensure that there is something over the head, such as a woolen hat or cloth (drape), to prevent exposure of the belly and chest.
Here he is positioned with the bridegroom'softenenteringthepartiesjustnow, and his arm extended over it; also placed on handmaidens and arms, holding hands.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When the limb'dictum is completed according to any manner that it can be done by you, and when you pause intermittently for its touching with flax wool of varying quantity; prepare a plaster made from powdered lead mixed in wine or alum applied entirely over all muscles so as to turn them upwards above the constriction, tighten continuously while touching it; twist and apply the ligament on top of this preparation, attach your limb's body therein (to its chest), secure with a leather strap around one’s collarbone for seven days without muffling said neck-strap.
When food from the melancholalgy is properly moderated and digested (pause), then comfort will be brought to the body (member). It suggests that managing one's dietary intake, particularly when suffering from what may have been referred to as a condition related to "melancholy" or excess humors in their system, could lead to improved well-being.
And when food is given more or less of the sixth or seventh in amount and with corresponding exercise movements; thus if it does not close and soften up, then already healing has begun.
If the joint is dislocated due to moisture that you add or for another reason, then in that case administer three kinds of treatments as prescribed in the book on treatment methods.
If all this pain is due to a ligament or joint that has not been closed for seven days and the bandage/tightness reduces them over some time, it means they are insensible or softened (thinning), which relates to their nerves located at the head of the muscle, where extension occurs, as well as in stretching.
From the dislocation of that which is causing pain in your chest and thighs (pelvis), reduction occurs by pushing and extension until it returns to its proper place; thus:
When it is applied in that other tight place, and cures as long as healed within therein.
If you harden the body' extrication in that limb and delay its movement, then let the humidity be moistened regularly until that heaviness is removed and it returns to its original state.

When the shoulder joint is displaced with difficulty; and it's dislocated in all parts, mainly at the part between backward motion or touching as per any given figure where the arm cannot bend nor be touched due to its condition." This line describes a situation where someone has their shoulder (shoulder girdle) joint significantly displaced which results in an indentation of this juncture and prevents movement, particularly when attempting certain actions like moving backward or touching.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When the restoration is possible for him/her (the patient), it's that his/her hand should be stretched out and arms extended, with the doctor'se hands being on their hips or under their arm so as to return the joint back into its proper place. The physician applies pressure at the joint in question until it realigns itself within the body.
If the dislocation is at the joints ahead of it, return with a bend in your arm so that you can touch behind the shoulder blade on its base whereby pressing upon the collarbone area holding their hands.
If dislocation does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and strong motion.
When two ministers stretch out their arms, they hold that instrument with both of them to prevent it from being extended too far.
And turn your arm completely over it, placing a long cloth or lariat around the patient'dict body.
When the doctor touches the joint, anoint that with some oil to help alleviate its causes and apply pressure on it so as for it returns quickly into place; herein lies a remedy in lubrication of the joint which facilitthy return.
Return the reduction of his abdomen that has been stopped over there where the stitching and effusion are in the album of humor under pressure, with a swolthy constriction downward, and the arm suspended from the collarbone; he lies for days.
And if it is necessary for her to be unbound or released from the place where she has been tied up, then loosen the ligament there and set that free as well.
If you see the joint not strong, then apply bandaging and linen strips to it, leaving them there for days until they are extracted; after that return those as well.
May you apply gravity to the reduction of the joint and its position is in motion, hence applying moisture and dry heat subtly until it relaxes; if there's a hernia at the fatty movement site, secure it, and place that on the bones above the joint throughout the day and night. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Intrude in that which is washed (perhaps referring to a bathing or cleansing process), where it has entered into its place
If you wish to do so, pause over that moist and split cow hide at the edge and hold tightly upon it; then make several passes with water until that is wet again and returns to its proper shape or disposition.
In this line of medieval medical text translation into English word by word or phrase by phrase is
Regarding the care for a joint dislocation between the arm and the body:
Malasse some of the masses are displaced, and reduction of these dislocations is laborious, even though it may occur at the time when they become displaced; thus there's a risk that the place of application (likely an open fracture or wound) could be lanced with cautery.
The reduction of the dislocation is that you hold the leg' extruded from under the hipbone on a table and extend it there with your hand or palm, and as for the doctor, he/she holds his/her hand or palm over the impending joint to push it back into place.
Even though it is considered that the palm lies on the belly of him/her/them, then let the hump lie on his/their abdomen above a table for extension and reduction; if dislocation has preceded, place her/himself/themselves atop such an intrinsic position upon this table so that the doctor's belly rests over the imminent joint.
And if it returns soon enough, good fortune befalls you; otherwise, that which is swolthy will soften its inflamed state and cease to cause trouble until the days are past.
Even though the knee joint follows its twisted nature; and there is no cause in the malady, but rather it becomes soothed and cannot be strengthened as a cause—know that your nerves have been bent or sprained, and not within you, but they are tense because of treatment with cautery on this limb (and possibly other causes provided by water infusion).
So when the patient recovers and is rested on this padding that we have recommended for them, their leg will be laid down and supported for days; similarly, it should also be cut off and its mass gently exercised.
May it be that if the patient' extraneous movement occurs and causes pain in them or increases their burden at any moment, apply warmth to their lower back and limbs with some heat applications until they are relieved (alleviated).
Capitol .xxix. (The provided text does not contain any specific

When a joint of those in their two hands or abdomen is dislocated, the limb with the displacement must be held and forcefully corrected back to its place." Here, it appears that there's an instruction for dealing with instances where someone has experienced dislocation. The directive suggests holding (likely some part associated with movement like a hand) while applying enough pressure or manipulation ("impulse") to return ("correct back") the displaced joint into position within "the hollow of their bodies" (possibly referring specifically to areas around the hands
Support the head of that body and suspend what was affected by the displacement; let it rest for two days." In this line from an old medical treatise, there is advice given to a healer on how to manage certain injuries involving dislocation or misplacement. The instruction suggests physically supporting (possibly with bandages) where they need support—the head
Support and suspend that body part until it is properly aligned for today." Here, the advice given appears to focus on how long or under what circumstances a dislocated joint should be supported before attempting any further treatment like alignment ("properly"). The term "today's day,
When it is not nighttime anymore, look at that second account/description and do not let the limb slip back into place during daylight hours but hold on to it until evening; then continue exercising with movement for as many days till healed." This sentence offers a treatment protocol based on daily routines. It seems there are different stages of care—holding (probably an injured body part) at specific times and resuming some form of exercise ("movement") to facilitate recovery, suggesting the importance of time-specific interventions in medieval medicine as well. The instructions imply that certain actions should be taken
When it seems to be water in the belly (if distended), bring that which is there and apply it as for the first operation while being healed.
When it appears as if fluid is coming out at other body parts.

The phrase you've provided, "Curacio de dislocacio dels spondils del dos," appears to be in a medical context related to the care
When any of the vertebrae in the back or neck are dislocated completely, and bone fragments (also known as os ejectados) come out during movement, such a situation is beyond treatment; thus leading to death by suffocation due to obstruction of airways ("malaute").
When suffocation occurs due to an obstruction of the throat ("malaute"), it is involuntary and cannot be stopped; hence, you must soften or massage (or administer) either limbs on this person's body or those belonging to another individual. Alternatively, a displaced vertebrae may also need to be returned carefully: afterward the manipulation of these four areas is repeated for treatment ("remocio").
So then it is swolthy at the back parts and completely blackened (or coal-blacked).
May the treatment of him be that you will consider if his yellowish discoloration from infancy is not cure nor health for all.
May enter through cauterization or percussion to these areas; they have already learned the advanced methods of treatment discussed in this conversation, from which may return with proficiency; and also remove some that has escaped due to excess moisture here, for their proximity allows us greater insight into its exposure.
From that one is not cured but rather only those who have applied water correctly, as recommended.
It is that the humidity has spread over his face from above of person'thy chest downwards without being moistened by perspiration, to prevent sweating on one's body (face).

The minister holds the staff and does not leave it in a hole; another minister holds the other according to that shape.
When the wrap covers the head of the malady and tightens with linen bands that securely fasten, extend the limb part to which the cap is attached, place it therein; then bind another band around the hips holding down their legs, where you must have them rest on cushions. Next, firmly tie all braces together at this point and attach these within the other staff where they need support for their feet.

Here comes the first source sentence to translate: The doctor places his palms on the spinal column for strength while returning it into place and adjusts their weights within that as well, which is placed upon one of those tables.
If it does not return through this manner, take a table of which the length or breadth is three cubits (a measure roughly equivalent to about one foot), and carve into the wall where we have indicated that the malady resides within its boundary at the extremity of the table. Return the pillow on the table to the backbone (spine), and have the doctor rest their feet on the other end, first beginning inside so that the spine is straightened out and returned to its place.
If you wish to hold the which has been turned over on its back; and it is that you must stay with your head down at the waist end of each staff (which are as long as an arm), keep your head between the knees at the lower part of the staff, so two staves in length should be a palm'seam apart. You have already held firmly on one stick within which you can turn over; and every motion must stop when grounded to prevent excess (gout).
And take a staff in which it has turned and turn it between the two sticks of each pair.
In the limb there is a disruption where it forms wood (likely referring to bone or joint), whose length is equal to that of a hand submerged and turned over in water, and similar structures are found in the other two pieces (probably indicating comparison with another part of the body).

When each twist and joint must be tightened by their own force as directed by the doctor who has manipulated the spine:
And apply that the spine is returned to its place, and it rests upon this plaster of lime cast from a tub or barrel made by three fingers' width apart, with such quantity extending over where soreness resides in the vertebrae, and above the parted spine.
Return its ligaments as we have mentioned before, and place the humors of nourishment below it so that it may heal.
If there is any possibility of return to the healthy state at the end of healing, then those medicines that moisten and cleanse have been recommended for a long time, which we now apply in this place; herein has already been applied a layer of lead.

For the treatment of a dislocated hip, here's what it might translate as:
Understand that the joint between the wide and the muscle is not meant to be dislocated only once or slightly, nor are you damaging those other smaller connections in their recesses where they bend.
The joint of the wide is dislocated according to four angles, it can be dislocated at the parts below, or above them, forward, backward, in front, behind;
Mostly it is dislocated at the joints, and rarely in front of or behind them.
E senhal of dislocation from the limbs is when you adjust the pillow for hygiene and place it undernethythe thighs make their elongation, they are pressed out to release bone fragments where blood can flow freely; this position allows spinal manipulation with cautery tongue application at fracture site so that vertebra doesn't twist its neck joint.
And if the fracture of that person is displaced from its parts, it means that the accidents in them are contrary to this accident.
Even that person whose dislocation you are examining currently spreads out the cushion (second restoration), but not so much as their current pain in the joint there; if it progresses and cannot be managed at those parts, then urine is retained within them and a callus forms on them. Therefore, they must walk with their feet placed over the heel.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "The name of that person from whom you dislocate parts behind is such that it does not expand the cavity nor can bend what already bent there, and the cushion placed on him/her is short compared with others, thus softening the joint (and) head of the thigh.
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and when the dislocation is old and ancient, it has already been subjected to your administration in such a way here that not all curing will be achieved; thus, do not expect immediate improvement from there.
In that which the dislocation is recent and one of the four species of dislocation, there: (a) turn your head to realign the joint, stretching it towards both upper and lower parts of the body segments; then return this position with care so as not to neglect other treatments.
May, if it does not return in this fashion, then you who prepare the medicine must take strong measures and extend the cushion of your servant from where they have departed; or place them on their hands/arms for a while until such time as medicinal applications touch upon those extremities. Moreover, another minister should stretch out that same application beneath it to prevent its descent below (into the cavity); with yet another minister applying pressure gently upward over the cushion'dictum of your servant; and furthermore one who applies force must be firm enough so as not to break what has been held above.
When it is an extension from the arm or leg joint to the shoulder joint of the collarbone, or from the hip joint downward,
When all of them are stretched out within a period where the malady is lifted up to its body part in the air and begins to descend,
This particular kind of extension is characteristic in all four. (The term "extension" here likely refers to some form or method used by medieval medical practitioners, and the phrase suggests that this approach
So if the dislocation returns as we have said, that is fine; but if not, then it's necessary for all sorts of treatment specific to its own care. (This suggests an approach where conventional wisdom or previously discussed treatments are acceptable if they work—the "fine" in this context likely meaning effective and without complications. If these do not suffice, a more personalized therapeutic strategy must be considered for the patient'dictor).
In the self-reduction, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation occurs at joints—so that bone of spine rests on its own lap; hold ligaments above the knob of thigh where flesh between head of thigh meets place to be pressed down by hand. And extend these same ligaments across parts left from shoulder blade as far upwards towards puck-joint (furcula).
Here comes another source sentence to translate:
This particular is of yellow bile treatment causes this limb reduction that other substances cannot achieve.
May it be excused upon you and not obeyed to this particular method of healing for all involved; provided that the two legs on which we are lashed together become strong links in our bondage, ligament and bone included between both feet and thighs.
Whenever any part of the body is considered long in length according to four parts (an indication that could be related to a specific measurement or assessment method), and when the thighbreadth extends as much as two such parts, so it shall be noted.
Return the leg (or hip) elevated onto the head of the bed, and ensure it is in a position that relieves pain. The length from the patient to the ground represents two fathoms.

Every minister extends to his/her own portion, and the doctor uses their tongue for reduction according to art.
When the dislocation is at the joints ahead, then cover it with bandaging as I have described in my treatise; and let the doctor's palm rest on the groin area of the patient, while his other hand compresses that spot, holding onto another part compressed by pressure.
If the dislocation is in the parts behind, do not let the humour spread to the limbs immediately, and raise it above the ground; they have covered where there is a hard cause, as we mentioned earlier about two widths of its face being dislocated, so that the skin and ligaments are extended outwards, without any need for cauterization.
When compression is applied using a table over the location where the joint has pain,
So when the reduction is complete, as it concerns your action—the term for 'reduction' does not concern you—and from there extend cushions under them, and once again those tightenings are released outside these cushions, at that moment understand that the limb corresponding to where they applied pressure returns; adjust hinges and pauses as needed between expansions of this bandage for three or four days.
Return the sinew and bandage back together, compare one cushion with another.
And if you see those instruments in the womb (referring to medical tools or surgical implements), then understand that the displacement has already been fixed, and hence let it go upwards into the humors.
If you see any cause for suppuration (infection), return and apply dressing to that area according to your first method of treatment, and leave it on for three days.
Return that particular one and let it walk slowly on these stairs for several days until comforted.

About the treatment of tarsal dislocation.
Le heel sometimes becomes inflamed after minor injury, and some times it gets dislocated either at the joints or in the groin area; this is called pain of the foot or hips.
When it comes to the name of this dislocation, they often refer to when the foot is forced towards where it has been separated.
May healing of the patient is through gentle release and ease in movement, which allows them to return comfortably.
