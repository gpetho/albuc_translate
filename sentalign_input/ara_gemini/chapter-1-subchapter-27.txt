Chapter twenty-seven on cauterizing the cold liver.
If pain arises in the liver from coldness and moisture, or from intense wind, to the point that it departs excessively from its natural temperament,
and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the classification, but it does not succeed,
then it is necessary that the patient lies flat on their back,
and three cauterizations are marked with ink in this shape and this exact measure:
On the liver, below the ribs, where the human elbow ends, it should be after each cauterization, with the distance between cauterizations being the thickness of a finger.
And the cauterization should be along the length of the body, straight.
And do not clench your hand with the cautery iron, gently.
And let the amount you burn of the skin's thickness be half of it, no more.
And the patient should be standing on his feet.
But if he is not standing, then he should be lying down, having extended his legs and raised his arms.
And this is the image of the cautery iron:
And you can cauterize these cauterizations with the scalpel cautery if you have gentleness and skill in the craft.
And be careful not to go too deep in the cauterization, burning all the skin, so that you burn the abdomen and reach the intestines.
For the skin there is thin, so know this.
