 CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR.
On cauterization for pulmonary disease and for cough.
 When the cough and pulmonary disease arise from cold humidities and the patient suffers from no fever or wasting but the disease is chronic, sear him with two cauterizations over the two clavicles, in the soft depressions ; and with another cauterization in the mid-line of the chest between the breasts.
Let the cautery be claviform as described above.
Then treat as before prescribed till healed.
And if you prefer, make punctate cauterizations with the cautery called 'punctate'; its shape has already been described under pricking for earache.
The punctures should number upwards of thirty.
Then treat as aforesaid until healed.
Sometimes also a trident cautery is prepared, in this manner, with which you can burn more speedily; for with this you can apply three cauterizations at once.
