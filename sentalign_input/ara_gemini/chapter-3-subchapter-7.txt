Chapter seven on the treatment of rib fractures.
The chest may be fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens.
As for its edges, they are most often fractured and fragmented.
And among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, is that it inclines downwards, and he experiences severe pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, and perhaps he spits up blood, and the concavity in the broken bone becomes apparent and is not hidden to the senses.
Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, and a pillow is placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are pressed, and the ribs are gathered with the hands from both sides, and gentleness is exercised in straightening it in every way possible and suitable until the shape of the bone returns as it should be.
Then apply the dressing and the binding, and place over it a splint from a thin board of willow or heather, or something similar in lightness, after wrapping it in a cloth.
Then be gentle in tying it over the broken bone so that it does not move.
And pass the bandage around circularly to the back several times, and tighten it firmly.
Then check the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if the need arises to loosen it, due to itching that occurs in the area, or pain, or swelling, then hasten to loosen it, remove the dressing, and treat whatever has occurred in its proper manner, then replace the dressing if you see a reason for it, and keep it tight until it heals.
