On the Extraction of Tooth Pain.	On the extraction of teeth.	0.77052057
You must treat a painful tooth with every possible means and delay its extraction if possible. Nothing truly substitutes for a tooth once it is extracted, as it is an exalted substance. Therefore, only when there is no alternative should extraction be considered. In that case, confirm thoroughly with the patient that the aching tooth itself is the one requiring extraction.	You should treat toothache with every device and be reluctant to extract; nothing can replace the tooth when it is extracted, for it is a noble substance—until there is no means of avoiding extraction.	0.8249519
Often, pain can deceive the patient, who may mistakenly believe the pain is in a healthy tooth and has it extracted, only for the pain to persist until the actual diseased tooth is removed.	When the patient is determined to have it out, act with deliberation till you are sure which is the painful tooth; for often the pain deceives the patient and he thinks the pain is in a tooth that is sound, so he has that one extracted; but the pain does not abate until the diseased tooth is removed.	0.716529
We have seen this occur frequently in the work of inexperienced phlebotomists.	We have frequently seen this happen in the practice of the barber-surgeons.	0.7674254
Once you have confirmed the aching tooth, it is necessary to scarify around it with a pointed tool possessing adequate strength until the gum loosens completely. Then, gradually move the tooth with your fingers or with fine forceps until you sufficiently shake it.	When you are quite sure which is actually the painful tooth you should cut away all round the tooth with a scalpel having a certain measure of strength, until the gum is separated all round.	0.73355234
Next, position large forceps correctly on the tooth, and place the patient’s head firmly between your knees to hold it steady. Then, pull the tooth straight out to avoid breaking it.	Then, with your fingers, or with a pair of fine forceps, first move the tooth slowly and gently till you stir it; then get a good grip on it with a pair of large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees so that it does not move. Then draw the tooth straight out so as not to splinter it.	0.76955724
If the tooth does not come out, take one of your tools and gently insert it beneath the tooth on all sides, moving it as you did initially.	And if it will not come out, then take one of these following instruments and gradually introduce it beneath the tooth all round; then try to move it as you did before.	0.8272604
If the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill the cavity with a piece of cloth, then secure it with the end of a thin rod to prevent it from breaking when you grip it with forceps.	If the tooth has a hole in it or is decayed, you should plug the hole with a rag, forcing it in with the tip of a fine probe so that it will not break when you grip it with the forceps.	0.88545704
Be diligent in scarifying around the gum on all sides.	You must completely scarify all round the gum.	0.6402126
Control your strength to avoid breaking the tooth and leaving part of it, which could result in complications worse than the initial pain.	Take the utmost care not to splinter the tooth lest a piece should remain behind and arouse the patient's ills afresh, causing greater pain than before.	0.7279008
Be cautious not to act like inexperienced phlebotomists, who in their haste and boldness during extractions, ignore the guidance we have provided.	Take care not to do those things that the ignorant barber-surgeons do in their rashness and haste in dental extraction, neglecting to employ the methods we describe.	0.7066582
For, as we have often observed, they cause patients serious harm, breaking the tooth and leaving its roots or even pulling part of the jawbone.	For they often bring great troubles upon people, the least of which is to break the tooth off short, leaving the whole or part of the root behind; or to remove the tooth together with a piece of the jaw bone, as I have often seen.	0.74511445
After extraction, rinse the site with wine or with vinegar and salt.	Then after the extraction let the patient rinse with wine or vinegar and salt.	0.8387935
If bleeding occurs at the site (which often happens), grind some alum and apply it to the area. If alum is ineffective, cauterize it.	If there occur haemorrhage from the place—a common occurrence—then pound up a little vitriol and stuff the place with it. If the vitriol does not avail, cauterize.	0.77306104
The fine forceps for initially loosening the tooth should have long ends and a short, thick handle, so they do not bend under pressure. The handles should be strong enough to avoid bending or folding when gripped. They should have short, straight ends made from high-quality iron or sturdy steel, with interlocking teeth at the tips for a firm, even grip.	The shape of the fine forceps with which you first move the tooth should be with long jaws and a short handle, thick, lest they bend when you take hold of the tooth.	0.74082625
Sometimes the ends are shaped like the beak of a bird called the stork, providing a very strong grip.	Sometimes the jaws are made like a file, also to give a strong grip.	0.71118927
