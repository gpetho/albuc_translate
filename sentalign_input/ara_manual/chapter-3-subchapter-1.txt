Chapter One.
In it are comprehensive and summarized points regarding bone fractures that should be presented. And before we begin mentioning the fractured and dislocated limbs one by one, it is necessary that we mention at the beginning of this chapter comprehensive statements and sections.
Which will compel you first to understand them and grasp their truth, you and whoever else is eager to learn this noble profession.
So I say that whenever a fracture, dislocation, blow, or fall occurs to someone, it is necessary to hasten first to phlebotomize him, or give him a purgative, or both.
Unless something prevents this, such as weakness of strength, or if the one to whom this has happened is a child or an elderly old man, or if the weather is intensely hot or intensely cold.
Then his diet should be restricted to cold vegetables, the meat of birds and kids, and he should be prevented from drink, rich meats, filling up on food, and any food that fills the veins with blood until the swelling is relieved and you are not expecting a discharge to the site.
Then, at that time, let the patient return to his former regimen, which was his habit. So if the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that the patient nourish himself with very nourishing, rich, and firm foods that have a viscous quality, such as porridges, rice, heads, trotters, and cow stomachs.
And eggs, soft fish, rich drinks, and the like.  For with this regimen, the consolidation of the fracture will be faster and better.  And know that broken bones, if they are in robust men and old men, can never be joined and healed according to their original nature.
Because of the dryness and hardness of their bones. And bones that are extremely soft, such as the bones of young children, may join and heal. But nature grows on the broken bone, from all its sides, something resembling thick glue that adheres to it and binds it until some of it sticks to the others.
And it binds some of it to others until it reaches the utmost strength and firmness as it was originally, so that nothing hinders it from its functions.
For this reason, it is necessary that the patient's food be foods that have firmness, viscosity, and richness, as we have said. And know that the types of fractures vary according to the differences in the organs, because a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone.
And so are all the other organs, each one different from the other. And we will mention each type of fracture, explained in its chapter, detailed separately. And the type of bone fracture may also differ in itself.
Because it may be fractured into pieces without splinters occurring in it, and it may be fractured along the length of the bone, and its fracture may have splinters and protrusions, separated and not separated, and the fracture may be with a wound and a tear in the skin, and the fracture may be a slight crack.
And each type has a specific method for its repair, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. And among the things by which a bone fracture is recognized are its curvature, its swelling, its perceptible appearance, and its crackling when you press it with your hand.
So when there is no apparent curvature in the area, no crackling, and you do not feel any disturbance when you examine the bone, and the patient does not feel much pain, then there is no fracture, but it may be a bruise or a minor fracture or a slight crack. So you should not move it by stretching and pressing at all.
Rather, apply to it the medications that will be mentioned later, which are appropriate for the location, then bandage it gently.  And know that when the bone is broken and shattered in two without any splinters occurring in it, each part has become separated from the other.
Therefore, you should immediately proceed to straighten and align it before a hot swelling occurs. If a hot swelling does occur, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in any way you can with gentleness and skill.
And know that repairing and aligning it is easier than a bone in which splinters have occurred. Then bandage it as will be mentioned later. If the bone has splinters, it is necessary to stretch the broken limb from both sides, whether it is an arm or a leg.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand. And place the limb on a level surface in its natural form, so that when the broken bone fragments are stretched, then you should return those protrusions to their places by any means you can with skill and gentleness.
Strive as much as possible not to cause the patient any pain or discomfort with your actions.  Strive to join one bone to the other in the best possible manner.  And at that time, you should touch and probe them with your hand.  If you find anything amiss, correct and align it to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive pulling and forceful squeezing, as many ignorant people do.  They often cause, by their actions, hot swelling or chronic pain in the limb, as I have witnessed many times from their practice.
Then, after alignment, precision, and bandaging, ensure that the limb is kept still and at rest. Warn the patient against moving it while awake or asleep, when turning or moving around, when defecating, and in all movements as much as possible. They should ensure the limb is positioned in a way that avoids pain.
Whenever they feel pain or discomfort in a particular position, they should change it to one that is painless, while ensuring that this new position is level and straight.
This prevents crookedness in the limb when it heals.  As for the method of bandaging the fractured limb, it is as I will describe to you. Know that fractured limbs differ in size, thickness, and form.  Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and similar bones...
...should be wrapped with thin, soft bandages. Those that are thick, such as the thigh, back, and chest, should be wrapped with wide, firm bandages, because a wide bandage holds the large limb and tightens it evenly from all sides, leaving no irregularities.
Then, after you have finished the alignment, you begin to apply the appropriate medication.
on soft lint at the site of the fracture. Then begin wrapping the bandage at the fracture site itself, three or four turns, depending on the requirements of the limb. Tighten the bandage slightly with your hand, then bring it to the area above the fracture site.
with less tension than you applied to the fractured site. Then move the wrapping slightly away from the fracture site and gradually loosen the tension until you reach a suitable portion of the healthy area.  Then take another bandage and wrap it also over the fracture site.
Wrap it a few times, then bring the wrapping to the area below the fracture. Your action in tightening and loosening the wrap should be as described for the first, upper wrapping. Then place soft lint or rags between the wrappings to even out the crookedness of the fracture.
If there is crookedness, otherwise do not put anything there. Then wrap another bandage over it.  Then apply your well-constructed splints over these bandages immediately if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply something that soothes the swelling and removes the inflammation, and leave it for a few days, then apply the splints.  The splints should be made of wide, carved, and skillfully prepared halves of reeds, or the splints can be made from sieve wood.
which are made of pine or palm leaf ribs or heather or Ferula and the like, whatever is available.  The width of each splint should be like this image and this exact shape.
Except that the splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints. As for the length of the splint, it is made according to what is appropriate for the fractured limb, whether large or small. Image of the splint:
Then tighten another bandage over the splints, just like your first tightening, then tie it from above with tight threads as we mentioned regarding tightening, which is that your tightening should be more at the site of the fracture.
And the further away from the fracture, the less the tightening.
The threads should be medium in thickness and thinness, and specifically made of damp linen, because if the threads are thick, as I have seen ignorant people do, making their threads from twisted strips of linen, this is a grave mistake.
Because the tightening with them becomes excessive, and thin threads are also not suitable because you will not achieve the desired tightening with them. There should not be less than a finger's width between one splint and another.
If the patient is bothered by the edges of the splints after tightening in the correct places, then place soft rags or fluffed wool underneath them so that they do not cause any harm. As for when the fracture is accompanied by a wound and a tear in the skin, we will discuss that separately.
Know that not every fractured limb should be tightened with splints from the first day.  If the limb is large, splints should not be placed on it until after five days, or seven, or more, depending on your confidence regarding the occurrence of hot swelling.
This is the description of the bandages that the ancients used to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains. It is a description of a general, simplified bandage that treats fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is neither excessively hot nor cold.
It is that you take mill dust, which is the fine flour that clings to the walls of the millstone when the mill is operating, and knead it, as is, without sifting, with egg white. Make the dough neither thick nor thin, then spread it.
The description of another bandage that treats fractures, dislocations, and sprains: Take ten dirhams each of mastich, labdanum, acacia, frankincense, storax, and gum Arabic; five dirhams each of myrrh and aloe; twenty dirhams of tamarisk; and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Greek clay.
Grind everything and mix it with tamarisk water or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot. Then use this bandage, for it is well-composed, quickly heals broken bones, and is suitable for most people due to its balanced nature.
The description of another bandage that is also useful for fractures and sprains:  Take ten dirhams each of storax, mastic, and white marshmallow; five dirhams each of myrrh and aloe; six dirhams of acacia; twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind everything finely, sift it, and knead it with water or egg white, then use it. 
The description of a bandage for joints and bones displaced from their positions, and it relieves the pain that affects them, and for bone fissures and fractures: Take degreased wool, soak it in vinegar and boiled oil, and place it on the affected area.  This bandage does not have the strength to set bones.
But it is excellent in relieving hot swelling and particularly in repelling pain.  The description of another bandage that sets broken bones:  Take leaves of the mute fig and leaves of wild poppy, grind them together, and apply them moist as a bandage.  The description of another abbreviated bandage used when a bone fracture has set.
And you want to resolve the remaining swelling: Take equal parts of marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and fenugreek flour. Grind everything and knead it with honey if the limb is not inflamed. If it is inflamed, knead it with coriander water or plain water, and use it.
The description of another bandage, stronger in resolving than this first one, used when a hard swelling occurs when a bone has set: Take equal parts of marshmallow root, flax seed, fenugreek, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile.
Grind everything and knead it with salt water or fresh water or honey, all depending on the heat of the limb and the subsiding of its heat.  As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that anything should be placed on a broken limb when setting it.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil, nothing else.  And he described that it should be of medium consistency, between thick and thin.  As for Galen, he considered that things with drying properties and some heat, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, and things like those we mentioned, should be placed on a broken limb when setting it.
The description of a bandage useful for weakness and pain: Take equal parts of litharge, chickpeas, chopped human hair or bird feathers, marshmallow root, and salt. Grind, sift, knead, and bandage with it.  As for the amount of time the bandage should remain...
Then it is loosened. Thus, observe: if no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place occurs in the patient, do not loosen it for many days. If, however, intense itching, disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in the area...
Then quickly loosen it immediately, and do not delay this at all. Remove the bandage from it. Then take a soft cloth or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching and pain subside. Then leave the limb to rest for an hour.
Then apply teased wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and bandage it on overnight, until you prevent hot swelling, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain disappears. Then return it to gentle tightening and light bandaging. Do not tighten it as tightly as the first time.
And be gentle with it until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms are completely gone, and you need bandaging and tightening, then replace it as you did the first time, in the same manner. If none of what we have mentioned occurs in the limb...
...do not loosen it except after three or four or five or seven days. It may be left for twenty days.  All of this depends on what you observe of the condition of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture sets and the flesh around it is nearly healed.
Then, at that time, increase the tightening more than your initial tightening, and also increase the richness of the patient's diet, as mentioned previously. If you see that the fracture site has dried and become thinner than it should be, then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.
So, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it, and let this be every three days, and slightly loosen the tightening. For by this action, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly. As for what the ignorant bone-setters do, breaking the limb again...
...because it did not set properly the first time and healed crookedly, this is a mistake in their practice and a great deception. Had it been correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it, and I have not seen any trace of it among them whatsoever. 
The correct thing is not to do it.
