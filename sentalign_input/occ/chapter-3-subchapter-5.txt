Chapter 5:
On the Restoration of the Collarbone when it is Broken.
Often the collarbone breaks in front near the muscle, and this fracture happens in one of three ways.
It can either be broken, separated, or split into two parts without splinters; this is easy to restore; or it can involve splinters, making restoration difficult; or it can be with a wound.
In cases without a wound, have two assistants present, one to hold the assistant and the broken collarbone, and the other to extend the neck towards the fracture.
Align the fracture with your fingers until it takes the proper shape, without any bulges or concavities.
If more extension is needed, place a pad of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit, of appropriate size; extend and elevate the collarbone and compress the pad with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned.
If you cannot pull the collarbone outward because it is pressing against the skin, the patient should lie on their back, and you should place a small cushion under the muscle of the affected side.
The assistant should press the muscle downward until the collarbone is elevated from the skin, then you can correct and align the fracture with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters from the collarbone and they are stuck, you must make an incision over it and easily remove the splinters.
If they are stuck in the bone, make an incision with one of the incising instruments you have prepared for this, after placing under the collarbone the instrument that serves the ciphac; it is a wooden or iron instrument shaped like this:
It resembles a spoon with this concavity; its width should match your need, depending on the bone's size or narrowness.
Its length should be suitable for your operation, with two ends, one wide and the other narrow.
If the incision made to remove the splinters is wide and you are sure of no pus forming, suture the wound's lips.
If the incision is small or you fear pus formation, fill the wound with cloth and powders as needed.
If an abscess forms, soak cloth in vinegar, rose oil, and wine, and place it on the wound.
However, the binding of the bone when it is without a wound or cut involves applying a plaster made of flour and egg white, covering it with cotton, and placing a pad under the patient's armpit if necessary. Then take a long cloth, like the one used by the Saracens, about a palm wide, and sprinkle doubled powders over the cotton and the plaster. Next, take a thin wooden splint about three fingers wide and of similar length, wrap it in cloth, and then wrap that cloth and splint around the area of the fracture. Bind it securely as described, wrapping it around the patient's neck and under the armpit of the healthy side and the injured side, covering the whole area. This way, the binding of the fracture remains firm and secure, which is not unknown to you.
Ensure the splint stays in place over the broken bone; check the patient daily, and if the binding loosens or the splint moves, correct and tighten it.
When the patient sleeps, place a small pillow under their head to elevate the injured side, lifting the broken collarbone. Alternatively, tie their arm to their neck.
Do not remove the binding unless there is swelling or an abscess, for twelve days.
Renew the plaster if needed, adjust the binding, and leave it until the fracture is healed and solidified.
The fracture usually stabilizes and strengthens within 28 days, though it can take less time in some people.
